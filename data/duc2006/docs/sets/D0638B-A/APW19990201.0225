	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Galileo spacecraft halted all  
non-essential activities by going into a ``safe mode'' shortly 
after close approaches to the moon Europa and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was stable and information it sent suggested that  
observations of Europa were successfully stored in its tape 
recorder, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a safe mode, a spacecraft automatically tries to maintain  
contact with Earth while halting non-essential activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred about four hours after a flyby within 900  
miles of the surface of Europa and one hour after passing within 
360,000 miles of Jupiter's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The encounter called for turns to point instruments at Europa  
and then turning back to a position pointing more directly toward 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Project team members were analyzing the problem. Preliminary  
analysis indicated that Galileo went into safe mode after software 
designed to watch out for faults detected that the spacecraft was 
taking too long to complete a turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7,  
1995. It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway 
through an $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and 
other moons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's was the last of eight Europa encounters during the  
extended mission, which anticipates 14 different orbits around 
Jupiter.
