   An analysis of striking scalloped fracture lines in the frozen
surface of Jupiter's moon Europa has yielded the strongest evidence
yet that a global ocean of liquid water once lay beneath the thick
crust of ice, and may still be there.
</P>
<P>
   The research, based on detailed photographs from the Galileo
spacecraft, shows how the extreme ebb and flow of tides in a
subsurface ocean may have flexed the ice surface and created the
elaborate patterns of curving cracks and ridges on Europa that are
unlike anything else seen in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Planetary scientists from the University of Arizona concluded in
a report being published Friday in the journal Science that the
findings make Europa a prime target in the search for life beyond
Earth. Where there is so much liquid water, scientists speculate,
there just might be some elemental forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a Voyager spacecraft flew by Europa in 1979,
scientists have entertained the intriguing possibility of a global
ocean below its surface. The ocean, warmed by Europa's interior
heat, could extend as deep as 100 miles, 20 times greater than
Earth's oceans. Its ice crust could be up to eight or 10 miles
thick. Europa is about the size of Earth's moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter and its
four largest satellites since 1995, has produced pictures at closer
range that strengthened the global-ocean hypothesis. But scientists
were puzzled by the chains of scalloped, or cycloidal, fracture
lines that ran for hundreds of miles across the frozen surface of
Europa. Scientists think the distinctive patterns of the fracture
lines reveal their origins and confirm the notion of a Europan
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona planetary scientists, led by Dr. Gregory Hoppa,
theorized that Jupiter's huge size _ it is 300 times as massive as
Earth _ causes tremendous tidal stresses on Europa. The tidal ebb
and flow would be especially pronounced on a body of liquid water.
According to their model, Europa's ocean tides must rise and fall
some 100 feet, compared with Earth tides of about 4 to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Europa's slightly eccentric orbit, the scientists said,
contribute to the tidal forces that created the cycloid shapes of
the fracture lines. When Europa is closer to Jupiter, the tides are
higher because the planet's gravitational tug is greater. When
Europa is farther away, the tides fall. This causes Europa's ice
shell to flex and crack. The crack would propagate slowly across
the ever-changing stress field, describing an arc.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists using the model say each arc segment in the
scalloped lines forms in 3.5 days, which happens to be the time it
takes Europa to make one complete orbit around Jupiter. Each arc
ranges from 45 miles to 120 miles in length.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hoppa, of the university's Lunar and
Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, said, ``The only way this model
works is if there is a significant water layer below the ice. Only
if there is a liquid water ocean could there be tides that would
account for the surface features we see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Arizona team are Dr. B. Randall Tufts, Dr.
Richard Greenberg and Dr. Paul Geissler.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists caution that the findings do not necessarily mean
there is still a liquid ocean under Europa's ice, only that there
was one there when the surface markings were formed. Other
planetary scientists agreed, but noted that the relative absence of
cratering on Europa indicated that the strong ocean tidal forces
must have existed in the recent past. They could not think of any
obvious reason why the liquid ocean would have disappeared in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University in Tempe, a
member of the Galileo science team, said, ``The likelihood is that,
yes, there are liquid oceans on Europa, but we can't say that
definitively with the information available now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of increasing interest in Europa's watery past or
present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in
2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008. Its
remote-sensing instruments are to include ice-penetrating radar to
establish once and for all if there are still oceans on Europa.
