<P>
   When the durability and longevity of spacecraft have counted
most, on long voyages to the outer planets of the sun, fortune has
smiled on American space scientists.
</P>
<P>
   There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then
Saturn in the early 1970s. Its five-watt radio signal could still
be heard, a decade later, as Pioneer became the first machine of
human design to leave the sun's planetary system.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Voyager 2. Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the
spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other
two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s. Looking back,
Voyager 2 was still able to take a family portrait of the planets,
specks of light dancing around a stellar maypole.
</P>
<P>
   In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has
defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four
years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four
major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the
scientific mind.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100
erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the
only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and
data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice
and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially close encounter with Europa last month, the
spacecraft picked up strong signals of peculiar changes in
Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most compelling evidence so far, scientists said last
week, of an electrically conducting material in Europa's
subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. Since liquid water is an
essential ingredient of life, these intriguing clues have
encouraged speculation that the first extraterrestrial life,
however simple, may be found in the seas of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes
how Jupiter's intense radiation could provide all the energy
necessary for chemical reactions to create and maintain living
organisms in a subsurface ocean, if one exists at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Chyba of Stanford University proposed that in
the absence of sunlight for photosynthesis, the radiation
bombardment ``should produce organic and oxidant molecules
sufficient to fuel a substantial Europan biosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's enduring successes have been a happy surprise in view
of its early prospects, which were none too bright.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1989, Galileo took six years getting to Jupiter by a
circuitous route dictated by the power limitations at its sendoff.
The spacecraft's full capability has been hobbled by the failure of
the main antenna to unfurl and the erratic behavior of a tape
recorder. In the last year, repeated zappings from Jupiter's
intense radiation belts have damaged some spacecraft instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the spacecraft is reasonably healthy,'' said James
K. Erickson, the project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif. ``We've survived much longer than anyone
thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going ``well past
its warranty.'' Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the
spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of
two more years. It has now been given another lease on life,
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the lease is problematic. Fuel for maneuvering the
craft is running low. Its gyroscopes for navigating are on their
last legs. And officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are debating the cost-effectiveness of operating
Galileo for the full 14 additional months of operations requested
by scientists and engineers of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Their eagerness to keep Galileo going has been fed by its most
recent observations, especially those revealing the four largest
Jovian moons to be spectacularly diverse worlds. They were
discovered in 1610 by the spacecraft's namesake, Galileo Galilei,
who recognized in their orbits a kind of solar system in miniature
but had no inkling of what they looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo
spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa. Scientists wanted a
better look at this ice-covered moon, about the size of Earth's
moon. They were intrigued by the many cracks running for a thousand
miles or more across an otherwise fairly smooth crater-free
surface. The cracked landscape reminded them of broken glass
repaired by an icy glue oozing up from below.
</P>
<P>
   This and other aspects of the surface geology suggested that a
layer of liquid water could lie beneath the outer shell of ice.
Scientists reasoned that the strong tidal forces of Jupiter caused
regular expansions and contractions of Europa. The flexing is the
most likely source of the heat in the moon's interior needed to
melt a layer of water between its outer icy surface and its rocky
interior, at a depth of perhaps 60 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Such conjecture has stirred wide interest among scientists
because liquid water is one of the essential ingredients of life.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, Galileo flew within 218 miles of Europa, about the
altitude that space shuttles often maintain above Earth and close
enough for detailed observations by the spacecraft's magnetometer.
</P>
<P>
   Europa lies within Jupiter's magnetic field, which changes
direction in the vicinity of Europa every five and a half hours.
This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like
an ocean of salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo, scientists reported, detected the kind of magnetic
disturbances that would be predicted if the Jovian magnetic-field
variations had produced an electric current through a conductor on
Europa. Rock and solid ice are poor electrical conductors, but a
salt-water ocean would be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of
liquid water beneath Europa's surface,'' Dr. Margaret G. Kivelson,
a geophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said
two weeks ago. ``I'm cautious by nature, but this new evidence
certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more
persuasive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kivelson stood by her statement.
``Nobody I've talked to has come up with a challenge to this
interpretation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was
approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this
same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest
moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet
Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has its own
strong magnetic field, indicating that its core is a fluid metal,
which boils in a way that generates the magnetism and also heats
other parts of its interior.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising to scientists are the hints that Callisto, the
outermost of the largest Jovian moons, may also have a subsurface
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Callisto does not appear to have an undifferentiated interior
with a dense core and other distinct layers. Nor is it subject to
the same flexing tidal forces that heat up the closer moons. But
the Galileo magnetometer has observed that Callisto seems to cause
the same kind of changes in the Jovian magnetic field as those
detected at Europa.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the current issue of Scientific American, Dr.
Torrence V. Johnson, the Galileo chief scientist, wrote: ``Somehow
Callisto must be hot enough to support an ocean but not so hot that
light and heavy materials separate. The water layer might be
sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where
convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a
different convection cycle cools the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight controllers did not dare send Galileo into the blizzard
of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major
moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished.
For all they knew, the radiation bombardment would disable or
destroy the spacecraft. But scientists had to get a closer look at
the churning forces of Io, which the two Voyagers had discovered to
be the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's first flyby, at a distance of 380 miles in October,
produced sharp pictures of Io's pizza-pie surface of brown, red and
yellow minerals; red-hot flows of lava at temperatures of 2,700
degrees; collapsing mountains, and fulminating volcanoes, more than
100 of them spewing lava and venting vapor plumes miles into space.
Scientists found Io to be an even more explosive fire-and-brimstone
place than they previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io makes Dante's Inferno seem like another day in paradise,''
said Dr. Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson, a
member of the Galileo photo analysis team.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation
hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics. More
than a month later, on Thanksgiving Day, the spacecraft was sent
even closer to Io, 186 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Blasted even harder by radiation, Galileo automatically turned
off its cameras and science instruments to protect them. Flight
engineers quickly radioed commands to take the craft out of this
safe mode and give it new operating instructions, including
software ``patches'' to work around damaged components and
unscramble garbled picture data.
</P>
<P>
   One spectacular picture caught a fiery fountain of lava shooting
more than a mile above the surface. The erupting lava was so hot
and bright, the project scientist Johnson said, that it blinded
part of the camera's electronic sensors and created a white blur in
the middle of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the volcanoes of Io sometimes reminded scientists of the
lava flows and pools at Kilauea in Hawaii, they are really like
nothing existing on Earth and in much of the solar system since its
formative period over four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Io is the next-best thing to traveling back in time to Earth's
earlier years,'' Johnson said. ``It gives us an opportunity to
watch in action phenomena long dead in the rest of the solar
system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, Galileo is scheduled to make one more close flyby of
Io. Two encounters with Ganymede are being planned for May and
December. Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA
decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension
called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still puzzled by the wide variations in radiation
levels in Jupiter's neighborhood. Engineers would like to fly
Galileo longer as a test of its performance in this harsh
environment. The spacecraft has already been exposed to twice the
radiation levels it was designed to withstand, and continuing study
could yield clues to improve the durability of future spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans
for a spacecraft to orbit Europa, perhaps as early as 2008, and to
use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.
