JUPITER'S MOONS BOOST HOPES OF FINDING LIFE

    New evidence from the Galileo spacecraft orbiting Jupiter
reveals that the planet's crater-blasted moon Callisto _ long
thought to be solid rock to the core _ may conceal a salty ocean
much like Earth's.
<TEXT>

   The vast warm ocean that probably lies beneath the
iceberg-studded crust of Europa is equally salty too, scientists
now say.
</P>

   A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field
that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a
sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected
effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the
existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the
mysterious satellites.

   ``Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon,
just a hunk of rock and ice,'' said space physicist Margaret
Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has
been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents
flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new data certainly suggest that something is hidden below
Callisto's surface, and that something may well be a salty
ocean,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy
crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached
the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow
and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the
presence of organic matter _ the possible precursors of life _ in a
warm ocean miles beneath the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The two moons possess only weak magnetic fields of their own.
But the electric currents that Galileo's magnetometer first
detected on Europa's surface indicate that Jupiter's erratic
magnetic field is strongly influencing the currents around the
satellite, Kivelson said. That fact, she and her colleagues
theorize, would best be explained by a liquid ocean salty enough to
conduct electromagnetic currents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team had no evidence that Callisto was anything but
an inert rocky satellite whose craters are pocked with ice, the
scientists reviewed their magnetometer data from Galileo when the
spacecraft flew past the moon three times in 1996 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, Kivelson said Wednesday, they found evidence
of electric currents flowing on Callisto's surface, and they too
could only be explained if beneath the rock and ice there existed a
salty ocean carrying electrical currents sufficient to produce a
full-scale magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Although life is conceivably possible in Europa's relatively
warm ocean, it is most unlikely in the waters of Callisto because
not enough energy would be available there, said Galileo project
scientist Torrance Johnson at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Europa the ocean's warmth is produced both by internal
radioactivity and by tidal energy generated by the moon's closeness
to Jupiter, Johnson said. But Callisto has no tidal energy because
it is much farther from Jupiter, so its only heat would come from
internal radioactivity _ not nearly enough for life to exist,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes
scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled. A full report on
the group's new findings is being published Thursday in the
scientific journal Nature.
