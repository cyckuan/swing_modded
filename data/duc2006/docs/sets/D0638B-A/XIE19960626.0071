<HEADLINE> Space Probe Galileo Closes In On Jupiter's Biggest Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Spacecraft Galileo will close
in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede early Thursday morning to
gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy
satellite, according to a NASA report.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with 10 scientific instruments, Galileo, the 2.5-ton
unmanned probe launched in October 1989, will fly only 840
kilometers above Ganymede's surface at 2:29 a.m. Eastern
Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), or 0629 GMT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Galileo will return high-resolution images showing features on
Ganymede as small as 10 meters across. It will also assess the
moon's surface chemistry and search for signs of an atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
If Galileo's operations and the subsequent transmission of data
to Earth occur as planned, NASA said, selected images of Ganymede
will be released in a televised news conference on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Galileo's Ganymede encounter marks the start of a steady stream
of data to be returned to Earth throughout its two-year tour of
the Jovian system. The data return will include an average of two
to three images per day before December 1997, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
Galileo's other studies will include a search for auroral
activity on Jupiter's nightside and observations of other Jovian
moons, such as Io, Europa and Callisto.
</P>
<P>
With a diameter of 5,230 kilometers, Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system -- bigger than Mercury and about
three-fourths the size of Mars. It has a variety of Earth-like
geological formations and is believed to be about half water-ice
and half rock.
