   For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering
ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the
frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a
Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy
surface. The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles
below the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly
carbonated. Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible
for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the
moon's face.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an
instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of
various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic
wavelengths of light. The wavelengths measured by Galileo's
spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''
