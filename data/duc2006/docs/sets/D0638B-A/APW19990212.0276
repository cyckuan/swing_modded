<HEADLINE> Spacecraft OK After Semi-Shutdown </HEADLINE>

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Galileo spacecraft is operating  
normally again, nearly two weeks after it went into semi-shutdown 
when its onboard computer became confused after a pass by Jupiter's 
moon Europa, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft went back into normal mode on Wednesday after  
technicians sent it a series of commands. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo went into ``safing mode'' on Jan. 31, four hours after  
zooming by Europa to try to determine if it has ice-spewing 
volcanoes, said David Senske, a member of the Galileo imaging team 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

<P>
	After the approach, Galileo was turning to locate the sun so it  
could better position its antenna and beam data back to Earth, 
Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a ``blind spot'' between two sun sensors confused the  
onboard computer, which automatically shut down nonessential 
activities, including some instruments, switched to some backup 
hardware and sent out a signal to let technicians know it was going 
into the safing mode, Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem apparently was caused by the unusual angle Galileo  
had adopted in order to study Europa, Senske said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galileo was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter on Dec. 7,  
1995. It completed its $1.5 billion primary mission and is halfway 
through a $30 million extended mission focusing on Europa and other 
moons.
