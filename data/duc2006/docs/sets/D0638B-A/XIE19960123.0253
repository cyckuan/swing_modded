<HEADLINE> Galileo Probe Suggests Review of Planetary Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Initial analysis of early
data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their
theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA
press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and
entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first
man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and
sent back data on its way to demise.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our most
optimistic predictions," said Dr. Wesler Huntress, Associate
Administrator for Space Science with the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
"It will allow the scientific community to develop valuable new
insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system and
the origins of life within it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere offered some surprise.
It contains lower than expected levels of helium, neon, and some
heavy elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur, said projects
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense
turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere.
It provides evidence that the energy source driving Jupiter's
circulation is "probably heat escaping from the deep interior of
the planet," said Dr. Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
"The probe also discovered an intense new radiation belt above
Jupiter's cloud tops, and a veritable absence of lighting."
</P>
<P>
The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about
one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the
absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding
organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project
scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a
reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the
solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has
a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the
primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were
formed.
</P>
<P>
The Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering
Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7 last year. It sent back more
than 30 minutes of data before its life came to an end under
extreme conditions including entry speed of about 170,000
kilometers per hour, temperatures twice those on the surface of
the Sun and 230 times the strength of gravity on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle
Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to
study Jupiter and its moons.
