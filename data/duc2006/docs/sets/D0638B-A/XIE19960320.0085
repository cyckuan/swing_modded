<HEADLINE> Space Probe Reveals Jupiter Hotter and Windier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The planet Jupiter is much hotter
and windier than previously believed, the latest information from
the space probe Galileo has shown.
</P>
<P>
The chemical composition of the planet, which hasn't changed
for 5,000 million years, is almost exactly like the sun's, a
report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Information sent back by Galileo shows that the central regions
of Jupiter are much hotter than previously believed and winds
around Jupiter exceeded 400mph, almost 100mph faster than hitherto
thought. These winds are driven by heat escaping from the planet's
core.
