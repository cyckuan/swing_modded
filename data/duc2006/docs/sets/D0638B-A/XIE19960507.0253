<HEADLINE> Probe Galileo Finds Giant Iron Core in Jupiter's Moon Io </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jupiter's volcano-pocked moon
Io has been found by the Galileo spacecraft to have a giant iron
core that takes up half its diameter, reported the May 3 issue of
the Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
From the data taken by Galileo, scientists have determined that
Io has a two-layer structure. At the center is a metallic core,
probably made of iron and iron sulfide, about 560 miles in radius,
which is overlain by a mantle of partily molten rock and crust.
</P>
<P>
The probe also has detected a large hole in the Jupiter's
magnetic field near Io, leading to speculation about whether Io
possesses its own magnetic field. If so, it would be the first
planetary moon known to have one.
</P>
<P>
This new information of Io may be related to the intense
heating of the moon caused by the constant squeezing and
distortion of Io in the Jupiter's powerful gravitational grip,
according to Galileo Project Scientist Dr. Torrence Johnson of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October
18, 1989. It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of
the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on
its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
Io is less than a third of the Earth's size, but it generates
twice as much heat as the Earth.
