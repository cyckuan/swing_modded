	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may
be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself,
researchers say.
	   Using instruments orbiting Jupiter on the Galileo spacecraft,
researchers calculated the temperature of lava spewing from
volcanoes on Io. They found that 12 vents had temperatures of 2,200
degrees F (just over 1,200 C) and that one vent was as hot as 3,100
degrees (more than 1,700 C).
	   The temperature of lava erupting to the surface on Earth is
generally around 2,000 F, or almost 1,100 C, according to standard
references.
	   ``The very hot lavas erupting on Io are hotter than anything
that has erupted on Earth for billions of years,'' said Alfred
McEwen, lead author of a study appearing Friday in the journal
Science. ``They are the highest surface temperatures in the solar
system other than the sun itself.''
	   Io is so far from the sun, about 1.2 billion miles, that most of
its surface is well below freezing. Only in or near the volcano
vents is the moon's surface warm.
