<HEADLINE> Insecticide Treated Nets Can Prevent Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Monday called on people to use insecticide
treated nets to prevent mosquito from spreading malaria.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye made the appeal while opening the Second International
Conference on Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzanian capital Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said in Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of outpatient
services and the number one cause of child mortality. Statistics
indicated that 25- 42 percent of outpatient visits and 25 percent
of deaths reported in Tanzanian health facilities are due to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is also a major impediment to social and economic
development throughout Africa, he said, adding that it is
estimated that by the year 2000 the annual direct economic cost of
malaria across Africa will exceed 3. 5 billion U.S. dollars, twice
 what it was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched
their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on
malaria related illness. For example, outpatient treatment of
malaria accounts for up to 40 percent of Africa's public health
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The recent emergence and spread of malaria resistant to
chloroquine, a drug that has saved millions of lives for over five
decades, further highlights the need to promote new strategies to
protect vulnerable populations from infection and put our emphasis
on preventative measures, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the key
components of prevention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said based on field trials in Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana, it
has been established that when properly used ITNs could reduce
mortality by more than 30 percent, and hospitalization by more
than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We learnt also that malaria could be prevented, and more than
500,000 lives could be saved each year (C if ITNs were widely
available to many households in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Prime Minister said that the fight
against malaria by destroying habitat of mosquitoes has to
continue, adding that people need to clean their surroundings by
cutting grass and shrubs around houses and destroying stationary
water ponds.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the London-based Malaria
Consortium, has attracted more than 230 delegates from some 40
countries across the world. The first conference was held in
Washington in 1997.
