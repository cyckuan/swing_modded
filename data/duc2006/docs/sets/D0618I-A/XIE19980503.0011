HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa is optimistic in its
endeavors to eradicate malaria which has affected the social and
economic development of the continent, health experts meeting in
Harare said.
</P>
<P>
The experts who met for the two-day preparatory committee
meeting on the African initiative for malaria control in the 21st
century were from different institutions affiliated to the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a provisional report released Saturday in Harare,
the meeting which ended Thursday resolved to develop an effective
and timely malaria surveillance and information system.
</P>
<P>
That would help develop a practical malaria control strategy
in all malaria endemic countries by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no
longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The targets adopted by the meeting included reduction of
malaria mortality by 50 percent by the year 2010, and reduce by
at least half the socio-economic negatives of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the
strategy which channeled 10 million U.S. Dollars towards malaria
control in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
A further boost to their initiatives was through the
commitment of African leaders to combat the disease as evidenced
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Harare Declaration on
Malaria Prevention and Control signed in June 1997 in Zimbabwe's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also suggested that a competent interim
secretariat be urgently recruited. The secretariat would have a
degree of operational independence from WHO.
</P>
<P>
It was also recommended at the meeting that an African
Initiative for Malaria (AIM) steering committee be elected based
on a coalition of major stakeholders and medical personnel to
develop the fight against malaria.
