MALARIA EXACTS HIGH ECONOMIC TOLL ON AFRICA, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS _ Malaria hurts African economies more than has been
recognized but could be better controlled for relatively little
money, according to a new study to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Harvard Center for International Development
and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be
presented in Nigeria at the first conference at which African heads
of state will meet to discuss malaria, which kills more than 1
million people a year, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies between
1965 and 1990, the study concluded that the disease cut one
percentage point a year from the annual growth rates of those
economies. If malaria had been eliminated in 1965, the annual gross
domestic product of Africa would now be $400 billion rather than
$300 billion, the study estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The study's economic models, according to Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard center, took into account more than the
costs of treatment and losses associated with death. They also
estimated the losses from tourists and foreign investors who avoid
malaria-prone countries, the damage done by large numbers of sick
children missing school and the increase in population and
impoverishment when parents have extra children because they know
some will die.
</P>
<P>
   In most affected countries, the disease crosses class lines.
``It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor _ your chances of
catching it are high,'' said Nils Delaire, president of the Global
Health Council, a participant in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the
World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the
World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in
a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from
malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The chief weapon the sponsors endorse is a simple one: bed nets
treated with insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they favor more spraying to kill mosquito larvae,
education of rural people in the use of simple blood tests and
cheap drugs to keep patients alive until they can reach doctors.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   Nets alone could cut the disease by half, but only 2 percent of
all African children sleep under them. Each $8 spent on prevention
adds about a year of healthy life to an African, according to Ann
Mills, one of the London School analysts who worked on the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``World spending on malaria control and research for Africa is
maybe 10 cents per case per year,'' said Sachs. ``It's quite
dreadful. World Bank lending for malaria is de minimus. The big
pharmaceutical companies see it as a disease of the very poor, so
they never view it as much of an investment priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, many malaria-prone countries have per capita
incomes of less than $300 and health budgets too small for ``these
very reasonable interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sachs suggested that Western nations could significantly cut the
disease by spending $1 billion a year on malaria. The U.S. share of
that, he said, would be 75 cents per American.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where we're enjoying riches beyond what was
imagined 20 years ago, we can afford to do more than we do,'' Sachs
said. He might even, he said, dare to also suggest $1 billion for
AIDS and $1 billion for tuberculosis, for a total of $2.25 per
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Americans would readily come up with $10 per person if
they believed it was cost-effective,'' he said. ``And bed nets
aren't going to end up in a bank account in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is offering tax breaks of up to $1
billion for any company that invents a malaria vaccine, and the
Gates Foundation, created by the founder of Microsoft, is investing
$250 million in the research.
