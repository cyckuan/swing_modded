<P>
HANOI, January 28 (xinhua) -- The number of malaria deaths in
Vietnam last year dropped by 70 percent compared with that of
1995, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Only 198 cases were reported in the year against 660 cases in
1995. The achievement was attributed to the joint efforts of the
medical sector at different levels and the anti-malaria teams
preventing outbreaks of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The medical teams have provided medicines to 2-2.5 million
people and distributed three million mosquito-nets for malaria
prevention in remote and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
This year, the health care service plans to promote health care
awareness, teach people how to prevent malaria by themselves, help
village medical stations to detect malaria patients, and provide
mosquito-nets to all people in remote, isolated and mountainous
areas.
