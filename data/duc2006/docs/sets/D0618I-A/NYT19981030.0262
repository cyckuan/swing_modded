U.N., WORLD BANK TEAM UP AGAINST MALARIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three major U.N. agencies and the World Bank
said Friday that they were joining forces in a coordinated campaign
against malaria, a leading killer of the world's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria, which is reaching epidemic proportions in Africa and
parts of Asia, Latin America and the southern fringe of the former
Soviet Union, kills about a million people a year, and children are
especially vulnerable. Experts say one child dies of malaria every
30 seconds. Around the world, malaria kills 3,000 children under 5
every day, a higher mortality rate than AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Research on prevention and cures for malaria has been all but
nonexistent in big pharmaceutical companies for more than two years
because the drugs proved not to be money-makers, experts said
Friday. At the same time the parasites that cause malaria and the
mosquitoes that carry them have alarmed public health officials
with their fast-evolving resistance to most known medicines and
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing here with just about the cleverest pathogen
that's known to human medical science,'' said Dr. David Nabarro of
Britain's foreign aid agency, who will become manager of the
anti-malaria program in January.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be coordinated by the World Health Organization
in Geneva, in cooperation with the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF
and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive against malaria is the first big project
undertaken by the World Health Organization's new director general,
Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway and a
public health specialist. She took over the huge agency in May,
vowing to shake it up and make it more responsive to immediate
needs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday she called malaria a cause of rising
human suffering that targets the young and the weak, and said her
project, to be called Roll Back Malaria, was prompted in large part
by calls for help from African leaders. Experts say 90 percent of
malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brundtland also said that this project will be a
``pathfinder'' in better U.N. cooperation. The anti-malarial drive
will draw on each participating agency's special expertise, pooling
resources in an effort to eliminate costly overlaps. It is a policy
in line with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's management reforms,
which seek to streamline the way the organization works and make it
more effective.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the cooperating agencies said Friday that the
anti-malaria drive will include efforts to generate new research in
the pharmaceutical industry and to raise money from reluctant
governments, as well as local efforts to provide health centers
with insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for village beds and
packets of fast-acting pills or suppositories for malaria
sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the first year has been estimated at about $19
million for the organizations involved, with additional money being
sought from governments where the disease is rampant and the labor
force is weakened or reduced as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding is less of an issue than getting governments to focus
on malaria,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank,
at Friday's news conference. ``We are trying to make the case to
financiers that this is central to the economic development of
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program, said his agency was well placed to look at the
environmental situation in countries struck by malaria _ issues of
sanitation, for example. He said the ``social fallout'' of malaria
was also of concern to his agency.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, the U.N. children's
fund, said her organization would focus, as it already does, on
local-level work in poor communities, where malaria contributes
significantly to a high maternal mortality rate and to a high
incidence of anemia among women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Nabarro, now strategic director for human development at
Britain's Department for International Development, said in an
interview Friday that ``collective brainpower'' was necessary if
health officials had any hope of even halving malaria deaths in a
decade. He said wiping out malaria is an impossible goal.

<P>
   Nabarro, who has worked in Iraq and Nepal as well as Africa, and
taught international community health at the Liverpool School of
Medicine, explained that the project did not have a single goal,
like some public health campaigns. ``What we're instead trying to
do is approach an incredibly complicated health issue that's
associated partly with the way in which people have to live, partly
with a parasite that has one of the best disguises that we know _
in the face of any threat it can change its coat _ and an insect
vector that seems to be able to shake off insecticides almost as
quickly as we produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tore Godal of Norway, a tropical medicine expert who is now
acting director of the anti-malaria program, said in an interview
that one of the best hopes of finding medicine to cure the disease
may be in a plant cultivated in China and used there and in Vietnam
as a very effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is the ching hao su. ``The Chinese have used it for
more than 2,000 years against fevers,'' Godal said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has been encouraging China to make
medicines from the plant to standards that would meet international
requirements, Godal said. He said that the compound in ching hao su
attacks malaria so quickly and at so many levels that it also seems
to help curtail the spread of the disease by destroying parasites
before they can be passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Godal has also been involved in trying to persuade
pharmaceutical companies to invest in anti-malarial drugs. He said
only one, Smith Kline Beecham, has showed much interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese war actually made the U.S. Army invest big in
malaria drug development, and so some pharmaceutical companies took
up leads from that effort,'' he said. But today, he said, ``There
is no sufficient commercial market for the drugs,'' so
pharmaceutical companies are shying away from projects like this
that would take years to show a profit.
