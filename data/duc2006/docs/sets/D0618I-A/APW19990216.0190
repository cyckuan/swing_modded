<HEADLINE> New Vaccine May Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have discovered a possible new way  
to vaccinate against malaria, which kills up to 3 million people a 
year and sickens an additional 300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun  
developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even 
mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally  
difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought 
the best hope was actually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they  
focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine 
designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many 
stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it 
invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbits immunized with the new vaccine produced antibodies that  
prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from 
replicating in the blood, the researchers reported Monday in 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system  
doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist 
Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising  
enough to try the vaccine in people.
