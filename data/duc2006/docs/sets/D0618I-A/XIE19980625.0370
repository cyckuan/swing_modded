<HEADLINE> Malaria Resurging Worldwide: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is resurging in many
countries where it has been sharply reduced or even eradicated
and more than a third of the world's total population now live in
malaria endemic areas, experts say Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5
to 2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria each year, about twice
as many as 20 years ago, according to papers presented at the
third Pan-African Conference on Malaria which ended here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 experts and senior health officials from 34 African
countries attended the continent's top-level anti-malaria meeting
which started Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Currently the number of countries and regions suffering from
the disease reaches 100, said a press release issued by the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Annual number of deaths of children under five years of age
attributed to malaria hits one million, the experts said, "During
the last 10 years, malaria has killed 10 times more children than
all the wars that have raged over the same period."
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increased drug resistance is leaving populations with
no effective drug for prevention against or treatment of the
eighth lethal killer in the world -- the top one in Africa -- the
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is thus much more lethal in 1998 than in 1968," they
claimed.
</P>
<P>
"There is urgent need for research into new malaria compounds"
and more urgent need for enhanced joint efforts especially by
African countries to fight the disease, they said. Sub-Saharan
Africa hosts more than 90 percent of Malaria victims.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the only organized effort, in the continent,
addressing this issue (malaria) systematically is the African
Malaria Vaccine Testing Network," said Assistant Executive
Secretary Robert Mshana of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at enabling experts to exchange
scientific findings on epidemiology, therapeutic strategies and
the implementation of national anti-malaria programs.
</P>
<P>
The participants also studied the possibilities for the
establishment of a multi-national South-South cooperation on
researches and training in the field.
