<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Anti-Malaria Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
system launched a campaign here Friday to combat malaria which
kills about 1 million children every year.
</P>
<P>
In his message welcoming the campaign, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said the fight against malaria enables the U.N. to
focus its efforts on an issue "which has caused so much suffering
in Africa and other developing regions for all too long."
</P>
<P>
Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 300 million acute cases per
year, with most deaths occurring among children in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that poor health via disability from
diseases such as malaria reduces incomes by as much as 12 percent
in affected developing countries, according to U.N. information.
</P>
<P>
The use of simple prevention and control methods has shown
starting results, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in trials conducted in Gambia, Burkina Faso,
Kenya and Ghana, the use of insecticide-treated bed nets was shown
to effectively protect sleeping children from malarial mosquitoes,
resulting in dramatic reductions in deaths.
</P>
<P>
Based on satellite mapping and climatic information, the
distribution of malaria can now be determined at the community
level and the information will benefit national and international
efforts for malaria control.
</P>
<P>
New discoveries have led to a variety of approaches to a
malaria vaccine, with many of the possibilities already undergoing
human trials.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists estimate that it will take seven to 15
years before an effective malaria vaccine is ready.
