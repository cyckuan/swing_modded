<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Committed to Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have once
again pledged their effort to fight against malaria which is
plaguing the world's poorest continent and claiming a large
number of lives every year.
</P>
<P>
The 34th assembly of heads of state and government of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in a decision calls upon all
member states to commit additional human and material resources
for malaria prevention and control, including disease
surveillance and research, in line with the development of health
sector reform.
</P>
<P>
It also asks them to mobilize all partners, public and
private, local and foreign, to support the execution of malaria
prevention and control activities as part of the economic
recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the assembly requests the World Health
Organization (WHO) to continue working closely with the OAU to
coordinate efforts aimed at the eradication of malaria from the
African continent and to increase its level of support in that
respect.
</P>
<P>
The summit acknowledged the initiative and critical role
played by WHO in 1997, specifically the generous assistance
provided by the director-general through the accelerated program
of malaria control in Africa, the actions taken to develop strong
community-based approaches to ensure sustainability of control
and the continuing support in 1998.
