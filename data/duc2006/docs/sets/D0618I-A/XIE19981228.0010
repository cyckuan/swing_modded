LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is spreading quickly in
sub-Saharan Africa as a result of deforestation, global warming,
creation of dams, irrigation schemes and commercial tree
cropping, said a fact sheet released by the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Malaria affects 40 percent of the world's population in more
than 90 countries while over 90 percent of the cases are in
Africa where there are increasing levels of chloroquine
resistance, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Sunday quoted the
recently-released WHO fact sheet as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaria kills one million people every year in the world and
the vast majority of deaths occur among young children and
pregnant women in Africa, said the WHO's fact sheet.
</P>
<P>
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in
sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S. Dollars last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease,"
it said, adding that research and development in malaria
prevention and treatment have made advances.
</P>
<P>
Drug combinations for multi-drug resistance malaria and
vaccines against malaria are being developed at the global level
while insecticide-treated mosqui nets and curtains have
emerged in recent years as a promising tool to prevent malaria
disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, the World Bank and other U.N. organizations this year
have joined forces to launch a new campaign called "Roll Back
Malaria" to fight the disease.
