MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has made a big
stride in malaria control with malaria infections rate in the
country is now generally low, a senior health official said today.

<P>
Malaria infection rate in the Philippine has been reduced from
a yearly 7.4 per 1000 in 1994 to 3.8 per 1000 in 1996, according
to Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica.

"The massive infusion of logistics, training of key personnel,
the active support of local governments and communities, have
resulted to the marked improvement of the malaria situation in the
past six years," Reodica said in a statement.

From 1991 to 1996, the health chief noted, the confirmed cases
of malaria were reduced from 86,392 to 39,855.

Department of Health through its regional field offices in
collaboration with 824 local government workers, she said.

Although funding for the program has been drastically reduced,
"the achievement in control and prevention is significant,"
Reodica said.

The Philippines is also in step with the World Health
Organization target of a 50 percent reduction in Malaria cases in
the Western Pacific region in the year 2000, she added.
</P>
<P>
The health department has recently officially declared the
elimination of Malaria in 13 provinces out of 78 provinces in the
country.
</P>

is endemic, 16 have infection rates of less than one per l000
population per year, three have had no indigenous case in the past
two years.

among farmers, forest workers, charcoal makers, migrant workers
and settlers in hard-to-reach communities, including provincial
