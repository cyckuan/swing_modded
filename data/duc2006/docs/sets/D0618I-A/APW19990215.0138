<HEADLINE> New Vaccine May Fights Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of researchers has discovered a  
possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, one of the world's 
biggest killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaria kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens another  
300 million. Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has 
begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and 
even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally  
difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought 
the best hope was actually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they  
focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine 
designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many 
stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it 
invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists immunized rabbits. The animals' immune system  
produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading 
liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the scientists 
reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system  
doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist 
Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising  
enough to try the vaccine in people.
