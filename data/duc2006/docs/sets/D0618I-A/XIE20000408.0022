<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Southern African
Development Community (SADC) health ministers reached an agreement
here on Saturday on coordinating their efforts to combat malaria
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique,
Swaziland and Zimbabwe said in a statement that an coordinated
approach was essential to contain the spread of malaria.
</P>
<P>
They established a working group to investigate how to secure
funds for malaria control plans and made recommendations on key
areas in malaria prevention, treatment and control, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the working group was charged to
investigate:
</P>
<P>
-- the prediction of unexpected climatic conditions that may
adversely influence the incidence of malaria;
</P>
<P>
-- the harmonization of treatment and prophylaxis protocols,
vector control and the use of insecticides, taking into account
the national scientific evidence and prevailing circumstances;
</P>
<P>
-- developing clear guidelines on the rational use of malaria
prophylaxis and treatment during pregnancy;
</P>
<P>
-- examining and developing strategies to manage the effect of
cross- border movements;
</P>
<P>
-- the impact of the movement of people on the spread,
management and reporting of the disease, and
</P>
<P>
-- examining the extent of private sector influence on drug
resistance.
</P>
<P>
The working group sub-committee would report on the progress of
the investigations at the annual ministers' meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
The region has been hit by a recent spate of malaria caused by
floods sweeping through a number of regional countries.
