<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Malaria Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON(AP) -- Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent
malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone, the first
new anti-malaria option in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's
worst scourges. It sickens at least 300 million people every year
and kills up to 2.7 million. Drugs and insecticides have made it
rare in developed countries, but it is almost impossible to escape
in tropical, developing nations. Worse, it is evolving to resist
many treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle ache and
malaise. Without prompt treatment, kidney failure and other
problems can cause death. People who become ill with a fever during
or after tropical travel should see a doctor and make sure to
mention the trip, the FDA advised. Also, people planning travel to
a malaria-endemic country should see a doctor first about
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s Malarone was approved to prevent and treat
malaria in adults and children. It combines two medications:
atovaquone, used to treat lung infections in immune-compromised
patients, and proguanil, an old malaria therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In four clinical trials in Africa, two out of 279 people who
used Malarone for three months developed malaria. In comparison, 92
out of another 297 people who took a placebo developed malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia,
South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria
treatment, too.
</P>
<P>
   The main side effects were headache and abdominal pain; children
also reported vomiting and itching.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo said the prescription drug will be available in mid-August
but would not reveal a price.
