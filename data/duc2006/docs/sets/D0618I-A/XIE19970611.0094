KUNMING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of malaria has
declined from 249 people per 10,000 in 1953 to 3 per 10,000 in
1996 in southwest China's Yunnan Province, statistics showed.

Doctors in Yunnan, a notorious malaria-prevalent region before
1949, have worked hard to discover the characteristics and
mechanism concerning the spreading of malaria under the special
conditions which exist in the province.

The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only
malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been
running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than
2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment.

Doctors also popularize knowledge on malaria prevention among
people of various minority groups which are numerous in the
province.

Since the 1990s, the institute has received 56 experts and
researchers from 11 countries on academic exchanges and
cooperation projects.

The research of the institute has been aided for seven
consecutive years by the World Health Organization.
