<HEADLINE> WHO to Launch Anti-Malaria Drive in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
regional office for Africa said here Monday it was preparing for
a program that would progressively reduce illnesses and deaths
due to malaria to a minimum in Africa over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The program, called African Initiative for Malaria Control in
the 21st century (AIM), will be launched next year and will cover
all the 46 countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the WHO said the initiative will be
implemented in phases and was expected to reduce malaria
illnesses and deaths in the region by 50 percent by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal, according to WHO, is that by the year
2030, malaria will neither be the major contributor to mortality
and morbidity nor significant socio-economic consequence," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is one of the leading health problems in Africa,
especially in sub-Sahara region. About 550 million people in the
African region risk the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease attacks between 270 and 480 million people and
kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million each year.
</P>
<P>
The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite
has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
"The economic consequences of malaria-related diseases are
enormous. The direct and indirect losses due to malaria in the
region rose from 800 million U.S. Dollars in 1987 to more than
2,000 million U.S. Dollars in 1997," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The key features of the implementation of the initiative will
be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of
insecticide-impregnated nets, prevention and strengthening of the
capacities of countries and communities to combat the disease,
according to the statement.
