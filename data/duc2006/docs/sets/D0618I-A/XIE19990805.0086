<HEADLINE> Research Finds Infant Under 6 Months Vulnerable to </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent research study in Nigeria
has shown that children under six months old could suffer from
malaria, a situation which was previously considered unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hold that children at that age and below were never
thought to have malaria parasites because it was assumed they were
protected from the disease by the immunity acquired at birth, the
Panafrican News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says that the discovery could assist medical
 practitioners to adequately treat infant babies who presented
vague symptoms of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The study, sponsored by the African Regional Office of the
World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Nigeria
Institute of Medical Research, aims at ascertaining the current
trend of the malaria scourge among communities along the coastal
areas of Nigeria.

Dr. Bamigboye Afolabi, who led a team of the researchers in
Ibeshe Island, an isolated coastal village in Lagos State, said
that about 30 percent of the 450 children seen in the first part
of the study had malaria parasite.

"This research will definitely lead to improvement in the tools
for diagnosis and treatment of malaria and its prevention," he
said. "Most importantly, it will not only reduce the severity of
the ailment among pregnant women and children, but reduce the high
mortality due to the disease."
</P>
<P>
Afolabi said that the detailed result of the study had been
forwarded to the WHO, adding that its findings could be applicable
to other parts of tropical Africa, as well as other malaria
endemic regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 80 percent of the population of
sub- Saharan Africa are at risk of malaria.
</P>
<P>
According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigeria
Institute of Medical Research, "of the approximately 300 million
cases of malaria estimated to occur globally every year, over 85
percent are from Africa, and of the estimated two to three million
annual deaths, over 90 percent are in Africa."
