   WASHINGTON _ Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday
that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate
of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to
wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the
American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence
connecting Bin Laden to the bombings. But Saturday's issue of
Newsday reported that a witness had identified a Bin Laden
associate as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that
damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more
than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately
employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement
officials who asked not to be identified said there had not been
positive identification of the suspect, who was described as a
relatively low-level member of Bin Laden's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But officials indicated that this was the first potential
evidence leading to Bin Laden, whom the FBI and the CIA have
suspected from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have cited him since the early hours of the
investigation. This year he renewed his vow to wage a holy war
against the United States, and senior officials have said he has a
network in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he
has operatives in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials caution that there has been no hard evidence
linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings, Americans point to
the nearly simultaneous explosions on Aug. 7 as a sign that the
attacks were carried out by sophisticated terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's network has the financial resources and the
organization to have been the mastermind, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group suspected by the United States is the Cairo-based
Islamic Jihad, but it, too, is financed by Bin Laden, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the
construction business, Bin Laden is thought to have been involved
in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But for lack of evidence, the United States has never issued an
arrest warrant for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived for a time in the Sudan. He is said to live in
Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country. &QL;
