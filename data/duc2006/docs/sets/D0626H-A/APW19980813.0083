	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has detained several
people in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and
U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects.
	   The detentions were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing,
which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   Police in Tanzania earlier this week said they arrested 14
people in the almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in
Dar es Salaam, which took 10 lives. A Somali-born Australian was
subsequently released, presidential spokesman Geoffrey Nkulu said
Thursday.
