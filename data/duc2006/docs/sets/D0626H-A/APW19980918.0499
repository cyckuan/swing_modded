Tanzania expells 14 foreigners questioned in embassy bombing

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has expelled 14
foreigners questioned in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy here.
	   Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said Thursday
that five Iraqis, five Sudanese, two Libyans, one Turk and another
person whose nationality was not given were handed over by police
to immigration authorities on Aug. 27 for expulsion.
	   ``Lack of direct evidence to connect them to the bomb atttack at
the U.S. Embassy in the city was a major reason for their
release,'' Chilambo said.
	   He did not say when the expulsions took place, but he did say
that two of the Sudanese remained in his department's custody
pending investigation to determine whether they will be declared
prohibited immigrants.
	   The Aug. 7 blast at the embassy in a residential neighborhood
killed 11 people. In neighboring Kenya, an almost simultaneous
explosion at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi killed 247 people, 12 of
them Americans.
	   Two men are in custody in the United States in connection with
the murder of the 12 Americans in Nairobi, and a third is being
sought.
	   In the northern city of Arusha Thursday, Adadi Rajabu, director
of the police Criminal Investigations Division who is also the head
of the task force looking into the bombing, said police are still
holding two principal suspects _ a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose
nationality he would not reveal.
	   Rajabu said three other people, including the owner of a metal
workshop where the explosive device reportedly was attached to a
vehicle, were in detention and helping police with the
investigation.
