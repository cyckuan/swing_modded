	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross said Monday it is
investigating complaints of harassment from relatives of those
killed in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
	   In particular, widows are falling prey to relatives who demand
large shares of a 100,000 Kenyan shilling (dlrs 1,670) death
benefit paid from a national fund as well as a share of marital
property, it said.
	   Deprived of their rightful compensation, and even family
property by relatives, some women report they are homeless, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
said.
	   ``Greed is global,'' said Al Panico, delegation chief in
Nairobi. ``But it is extremely disturbing to hear from women
already traumatized by the Nairobi tragedy, and now struggling to
care for their children, that their plight is being worsened by
those who would profit from their suffering.''
	   A total of 213 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed
in the terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on Aug. 7.
Another 11 people were killed in the nearly simultaneous bombing of
the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania. More than 5,500 people
were injured.
	   A U.S. federal indictment alleges that four followers of Islamic
extremist Osama bin Laden plotted a far-reaching terrorist campaign
to kill Americans, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Three suspects are in custody in New York, while a fourth is
being sought.
	   The federation is supporting a Kenya Red Cross program to
provide medical and social assistance to those disabled in the
bombing, as well as immediate families of bombing victims. About
1,000 people will be helped over the next year.
