<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors charged Wednesday that the
American Embassy in Tanzania was attacked by at least six men who
detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks,
apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bombers died in the assault, which killed 11 people
and wounded more than 80, while another photographed the
destruction before fleeing, prosecutors asserted in a new
indictment returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment provides the first detailed account of the
bombing on Aug. 7 of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. It accuses five men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous
bomb attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya as well as
other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All five of the new suspects are at large, authorities said, and
each faces charges for which he could, if eventually convicted,
face the death penalty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced rewards of up to $5 million each for
information leading to the arrest or capture of the new suspects,
matching a similar amount being offered in the case of bin Laden
and two other associates.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been
charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the
embassy bombings and bin Laden's global organization. Four of those
are in custody in New York and two others are awaiting extradition
from Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's charges reaffirm the mutual and unrelenting resolve of
Tanzania and Kenya and American authorities to find, apprehend and
prosecute every single person who participated in the murderous
terrorist bombings in East Africa,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not charge the two men who are being held in
Tanzania in connection with the bombing. One of those men, Mustafa
Mahmoud Said Ahmed, walked into the American embassy late last year
and warned authorities about a plot to blow up the embassy in
Nairobi. American officials have declined to say why they are not
seeking his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The government has previously charged bin Laden and associates
with the bombing in Tanzania, but until now has provided few
details. Previous indictments in the case have been much more
expansive about the bombing of the Nairobi embassy, which left more
than 200 dead and thousands injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks
were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two
countries, under the supervision of members of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the indictment describes a meeting between one of
the suspects in the Tanzania attack, Mustafa Mohamed Fadhil, an
Egyptian in his early 20s, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who has since
been arrested and charged in the Kenya attack. It says they
discussed a fatwa, or religious opinion, in which bin Laden called
for attacks against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Fadhil and another suspect in Tanzania rented a villa
in Dar es Salaam, which became the ``bomb factory,'' prosecutors
charged..
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, the indictment says, Odeh and other
Kenya-based operatives were preparing in that country for the
attack in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July, the indictment says, the suspects in Tanzania
bought a 1987 Nissan Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy,
and a white Suzuki Samurai, in which the suspects would flee.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to
be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the
indictment says. They also were said to have bought oxygen and
acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries. Experts say these
are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.

<P>
   On Aug. 5, two days before the bombings, one of the conspirators
in Tanzania telephoned a counterpart in Nairobi, the indictment
says.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects in each country fled just before the bombings occurred,
it says. On Aug. 6, for example, the night before the attacks, Odeh
flew on Pakistani International Airways Flight (NU)746 to Karachi,
Pakistan, along with one of the suspects who helped to prepare the
Tanzania attack, the indictment says. It says the men left on
instructions from other members of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, a man described only as ``Ahmed the German''
detonated the explosive device in Dar es Salaam, which was being
carried in the Nissan Atlas truck along with the tanks and
batteries. He died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, another operative who was riding in the Suzuki
Samurai photographed the embassy ruins as he left the scene, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fadhil, the other four men charged Wednesday were
two Tanzanians, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani,
each 24, and two Kenyans, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, 22, and
Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, 29.
