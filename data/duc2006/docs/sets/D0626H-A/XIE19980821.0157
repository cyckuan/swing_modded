<HEADLINE> Grenade Man Identified in Nairobi, Two More Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The man who hurled a grenade at
security guards at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi seconds before the
deadly bomb exploded on August 7 has been positively identified
as two more people arrested, Kenya's national newspapers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mohammed, a suspect held by the Kenyan-U.S. joint probe
team following the bomb raid, was picked out by three of eight
witnesses Thursday, according to a report from the Daily Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report said it now appears that only two suicide bombers
died in the blast, compared with earlier reports that all the
three bombers who drove to the embassy died.
</P>
<P>
"The man who was positively identified was slightly injured by
the August 7 blast but he escaped with minor wounds which have
healed. This is the man who jumped from the pick-up at the
parking bay of the embassy, hurled a grenade at the guards before
the bomb exploded," the report quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said Khalid, who can not speak English or Kiswahili but
only Arabic, was identified by a guard and a civilian worker at
the embassy and a third witness. The witnesses also sustained
injuries from flying objects.

<P>
Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Louis Freech is expected to issue a statement about the bombing
probe before he leaves Nairobi for Washington at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
He came here Thursday evening after a one-day visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the investigators also raided offices of Mercy
Relief International Agency, a non-governmental organization, in
the Kenyan capital Thursday and arrested an Arab and a Sudanese,
the East African Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the plan to bomb U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined
for Kenya were dispatched through Somali and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official who saw the confessions of
suspects was quoted by local media Friday as saying that an
Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Saudi millionaire Osama
Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan, planned the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack at the u.s. embassy in Nairobi reportedly
killed 253 people and injured some 5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in
tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday ordered air raids on
terror facilities allegedly used by Laden in Afghanistan and
Sudan in a clear revenge attack for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from
Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.
