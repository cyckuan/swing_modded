	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A Tanzanian and an Egyptian face
death by hanging after Tanzanian authorities charged the men with
murder in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania.
	   Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed each were charged with 11 counts of murder. The Aug. 7
bombing killed 11 people, all Africans. Resident Magistrate Amiri
Maneto said no bail was allowed. A trial date will be set Oct. 5.
	   Police and soldiers stood guard while the two men arrived at the
courthouse, in the center of Dar es Salaam.
	   Three FBI agents also were present at the hearing.
	   Although no details were released in court, local media said
traces of chemicals that could have been used to make the bomb had
been found in Saleh's home and car. Police, the reports said, also
were seeking two unidentified men who had visited Saleh often
before the bombing.
	   No information was available on why charges were filed against
Ahmed, who authorities said also is known as Said Ahmed and Saleh
Aben Alahales.
	   Ahmed told the court he couldn't understand why he was charged
because he was not even in Dar es Salaam on the day of the bombing.
He said he was in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   Ahmed, a heavyset and bearded man, wore glasses, a gray T-shirt
and faded slacks. Saleh, slender and bearded, did not make a
statement. He is a native of Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania.
	   A nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Kenya, killed 248 people. The National Disaster Operation Center in
Nairobi confirmed on Monday the death of a woman injured in the
blast, bringing the death toll to 248.
	   Two men have been indicted in federal court in New York in the
murders of the 12 Americans slain in the bombing in Kenya, and
several other suspects were being sought. Among them is Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden, who allegedly runs al Qaida, a radical
Islamic network accused of planning the bombings.
