	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug. 7
bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had
made ``great strides,'' having already determined what the bomb was
made of and who carried it to the embassy.
	   Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in
custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi
said.
	   Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said
the investigation had made ``great strides.''
	   ``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' Piernick
added. ``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and
are also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered
it.''
	   He refused to elaborate.
	   Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the
other a foreigner. He would not identify the foreigner or his
nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was
Sudanese.
	   Twin bombings at U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan
capital Nairobi on Aug. 7 killed 257 people, 11 of them in
Tanzania. More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more
than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   ``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said,
speaking in Swahili. ``They know who took the device to the
embassay, and they also know some of the people responsible for the
event and others whose roles have not yet been proven.''
	   He said the three informants had all participated in the
preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now
cooperating with the investigation.
	   Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the
bombs had orignated in the Middle East, and were transferred by sea
via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania. Similar reports in Nairobi
said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by
road.
	   On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian
coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings
identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had
lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy
bombings.
	   U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 struck at targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that Washington linked to the bombings. The missiles
destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum
that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation
Khartoum has denied.
	   The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic
militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators
believe was behind the bombings
	   Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to
bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in
the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.
