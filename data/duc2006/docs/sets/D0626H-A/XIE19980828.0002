<HEADLINE> Suspects in Kenyan Embassy Bombing Sent to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects involved in the
bombing of U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, have been brought to
New York for trial, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first suspect, Khalid Salim, was flown by the FBI to New
York, the officials said. But the exact date of Salim's arrest
was not known.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal prosecutors said they expected the suspect
to be arraigned at midday in Manhattan federal court.
</P>
<P>
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and
other senior U.S. government officials will hold a news
conference at 1 p.m. EDT (1700GMT) at FBI headquarters in
Washington "to announce developments in the investigation of the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania," the FBI
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Salim is suspected of throwing a hand grenade to guards
outside the Naairobi embassy at the start of the bombing attack,
a U.S. law enforcement official said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also flown to New
York, according to a diplomatic source in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Odeh has been held by Kenyan authorities since August 14, a
week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the day of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said others among the several suspects in
custody in Kenya could also be sent to the United States for
trial.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the
hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary
that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite
new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.
