	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Two suspects held in connection
with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania will be
charged in a local court next week, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, told the
Swahili-language daily Mtanzania that local detectives and FBI
agents have completed preliminary investgations and have asked the
Director of Public Prosecution to initiate criminal proceedings
against the two.
	   ``We shall prosecute these in Tanzania ... any time from next
week, but not after Monday or Tuesday,'' Mahita told the newspaper.
	   Earlier this week, Adadi Rajabu, Tanzania's director of criminal
investigation, said police were holding two principal suspects _ a
Tanzanian and a foreigner whose nationality he would not reveal.
	   The blast at the U.S. Embassy killed 11 people, all of them
Tanzanians or other Africans.
	   A nearly simultaneuous blast at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Kenya killed 247 people, including 12 Americans.
	   The United States has formally charged two suspects for the
murder of the 12 Americans and is seeking a third. The two are
being held in New York.
	   Over the last two weeks, Rajabu and his team have been involved
in intensive consulations with the Attorney General's office and
Rajabu in preparing the formal charges.
	   It is expected that the suspects will face charges of murder,
conspiracy and bombing.
	   Mahita said others who are still in detention in connection with
the bombing and who could not be linked with it will be released
soon.
	   ``There is no point to continue holding those we could not prove
their involvement in the incident. ... We shall consult with our
FBI partners to establish those we shall release,'' Mahita said.
	   Mahita did not name the two he said would be charged and would
only identify them as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner.
	   Criminal investigation director Rajabu said the three people
remaining in police custody possess what he called valuable
information that would assist investigators in their task.
	   Among the three is a prominent Dar Es Salaam businessman, Thomas
Lyimo, the owner of Tomy Spares Manufactures Ltd., a metal-working
shop where part of the bomb is said to have been assembled.
	   Police said Lyimo was uncooperative with Tanzanian investigators
and FBI agents when he was arrested and questioned during early
stages of the investigation.
