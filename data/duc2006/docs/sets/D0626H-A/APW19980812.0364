	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man who was among 14
foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in
Tanzania has been released, Australian officials said Wednesday.
	   Muhamed Hassan Qassim, a Somali-born Australian citizen, has
been freed by Tanzanian authorities, said a Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The department can confirm he has been released,'' the
spokesman said.
	   Qassim, believed to come from Sydney, had just arrived in
Tanzania with his wife and five children to take up a position with
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees when he was
arrested by authorities investigating the blast.
	   ``They've been checking identities and papers and he was caught
up in that,'' the spokesman said.
	   UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg said Qassim was arrested for not
carrying his passport in a security sweep following the blast.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian man was
not a suspect in the blast.
	   ``To the best of my knowledge this Australian has been detained
because he didn't have on his person a passport when he was
stopped,'' Downer said.
	   ``He does somewhere have an Australian passport but he didn't
happen to have the passport on his person at the time he was
questioned.
	   ``I understand in Tanzania a lot of people have been stopped and
asked questions by authorities, but there isn't any indication that
he had in any way any involvement whatsoever in the bombings that
took place.''
	   The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70,
while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at
least 224 people and injured 5,000.
	   The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing
include six Iraqis, six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen.
