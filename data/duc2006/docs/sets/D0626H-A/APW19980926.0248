	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents have returned to a white
two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi
believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said
Saturday.
	   An American couple, who refused to give their names, said FBI
agents, who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug. 7
bombing, returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard
and the exterior of No. 43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge
of the Kenyan capital.
	   The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the
estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil, one of four
suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in
the blast.
	   According to a complaint filed Sept. 17 by the U.S. Attorney's
office in Manhattan, Fazil, a native of the Comoros Islands off
East Africa, rented the house from May to August and was later
joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali.
	   No neighbors, other residents, security guards or household
employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil's
stay.
	   It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi
investigating the bombing.
	   According to the complaint, the bomb that destroyed the embassy
was built at the house rented by Fazil, who is a fugitive. He is
alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the
day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the
bomb.
	   The house is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the embassy
building in downtown Nairobi.
	   Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect
charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the
al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The
latter two are in custody in New York.
	   On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested Sept. 16 in
Germany on an Iterpol warrant, was charged in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass
destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens. He was
not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in
the Nairobi bombing.
	   In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7, another bomb killed 11
people, all Africans, at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held
by police in Dar es Salaam.
	   Adadi Rajabu, head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian
police, was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania
saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection
with the bombing.
	   One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported
Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have
informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year
of planned terrorist attacks against them.
	   Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the
mid 1980s.
	   Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the
attack.
