	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped
up some unfinished business on Wednesday, meeting with Kenya's
trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car
bombing of the embassy.
	   On Aug. 7, Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kimotho and others
had just ended a news conference in a building adjacent to the
embassy. They were talking when the bomb went off, killing 247
people and wounding more than 5,000 others.
	   On Wednesday, Bushnell and Kimotho met again to finish their
discussion, Bushnell told Kenya Television.
	   The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast, which
damaged the embassy, shattered the glass shell of the 22-story
Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi House.
	   Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent
search and rescue at the blast scene, memorials for those slain,
and the relocation to a temporary embassy.
	   Kimotho, who was hospitalized with a head wound, said he and
Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Daley in September. His trip is still on, the
embassy said.
	   The blast in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment
as an explosion ripped through the American Embassy in Tanzania's
commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
	   The death toll in the Tanzania blast, initially 10, has risen to
12, hospital officials and family members said Wednesday. That
brought the toll for both bombings to 259.
