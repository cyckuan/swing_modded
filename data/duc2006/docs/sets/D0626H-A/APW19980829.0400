	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police said Saturday that seven
people had been arrested in a sweep following the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy here three weeks ago, but did not say whether those
detained were suspected in connection with the attack.
	   The seven were arrested earlier this week near the Tanzanian
border port of Tunduma, on the Zambian frontier, said a police
officer speaking on condition of anonymity. Their identitities and
nationalities were not disclosed.
	   The suspects were reportedly sent to the commercial capital of
Dar es Salaam under heavy police escort.
	   Police had been staging a nationwide manhunt for suspects since
the August 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which
killed 11 people.
	   A much more deadly blast at almost the same time outside the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya killed 247 people and injured more
than 5,000 others.
