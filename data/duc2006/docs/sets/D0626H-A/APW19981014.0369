	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ An Egyptian formally charged in
the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam has been
providing investigators with a lot of information but has been less
than forthcoming about his role in the blast, sources close to the
investigation say.
	   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were
charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11
counts of murder each in the bombing in which 11 people, all
Africans, died.
	   On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a
bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213
people, including 12 Americans.
	   Ahmed has told investigators that he volunteered information on
the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 8 to the British High Commission as
well as the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
	   But he denied having any information on or involvement in the
Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be
further identified, said Ahmed seemed to know much more about
international terrorism than an ordinary person would.
	   In an interview Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed
likened Ahmed to a chameleon.
	   ``He shows you a certain color, but ultimately you find it is
not his true color,'' he said.
	   Investigators believe that Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades
Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building
of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the
explosive device that blew up the embassy.
	   The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have
reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
	   Ameir dismissed a report in the current issue of Newsweek
magazine that members of Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist group posing as U.S. informants had gone to both
embassies with phony bomb warnings to learn how their security
systems would react.
	   ``Such information would definitely have been passed on to me by
my assistants, but as it happens, I had no infomation of that kind
at all,'' he said.
	   The FBI has linked bin Laden and Al Qaeda to both bombings.
	   Other sources close to the investigation said security at the
Dar es Salaam embassy was not high and that the bombing had, in
fact, caught security personnel off guard.
	   Ameir said the investigation has slowed down because the FBI has
completely changed its team of agents in Tanzania.
	   But he did say that investigators have determine that the
vehicle that carried the bomb into the embassy compound was a
two-ton Japanese-made truck purchased from Jaba Tanzania Ltd., a
local firm that specializes in second-hand vehicles.
	   Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried on a
water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the
embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood.
