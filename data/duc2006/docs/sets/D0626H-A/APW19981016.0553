	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A refrigerator truck transported
the bomb that killed at least 11 people and extensively damaged the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the FBI said Friday.
	   The driver of the truck died in the Aug. 7 blast.
	   ``From the evidence recovered during the crime scene search and
subsequent follow-up, it is believed that a 1987 Nissan Atlas
refrigeration truck ... was involved in the bombing,'' FBI agent
Kenneth Maxwell said in a prepared statement.
	   Maxwell, who is in charge of the team of FBI investigators in
Tanzania, said the cab of the truck was white or beige and the
cargo box was silver.
	   Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried into
the embassy compound on a water tanker truck that periodically
distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential
neighborhood.
	   Maxwell read the statement as Adadi Rajab, head of the Tanzanian
Police Criminal Investigation Department, looked on. Neither took
questions.
	   But as he was leaving, Rajab told reporters the driver of the
refrigerator truck died in the blast, and the death toll could rise
above the 11 dead, all Africans, who have been counted so far. It
was not clear whether the driver of the truck was among the 11
dead.
	   On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a
bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213
people, including 12 Americans.
	   ``A significant amount of progress has been made in this
combined effort, and the investigation is proceeding with diligence
and speed,'' Maxwell said.
	   He said photographs of the refrigerator truck and a Suzuki
Samurai car believed to have been used by bombing suspects are
being circulated.
	   He asked people who might have noticed either vehicle to contact
police.
	   ``It is only through this type of alliance between law
enforcement authorities and the citizens they protect that all our
communities become safer places in which to live,'' Maxwell said.
	   Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed were charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court
with 11 counts of murder each.
	   Investigators say Ahmed has been providing them with a lot of
information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in
the blast.
	   Ahmed has told investigators he volunteered information on the
Nairobi bombing to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam on
Aug. 8 as well as to the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
	   But investigators say he has denied having any information on or
involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   Investigators believe Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
	   They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades
Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building
of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the
explosive device that blew up the embassy.
	   The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have
reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
	   The FBI has linked Saudi Arabia billionaire fugitive in
Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, to both
bombings.
