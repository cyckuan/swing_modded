WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
concerned over more "terrorist" attacks by forces of Osama bin
Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted recent activity similar to what occurred prior
to the African embassy bombings... And I must tell you we are
concerned that one or more of bin Laden's attacks could occur at
any time," Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We are anticipating bombing attempts with conventional
explosives, but his operatives are also capable of kidnappings and
assassinations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi suspect bin Laden is accused of plotting the bomb attacks
on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August that killed
250 people.
</P>
<P>
"There is not the slightest doubt that Osama bin Laden, his
worldwide allies, and his sympathizers are planning further
attacks against us," Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is offering up to 5 million dollars for
information leading to bin Laden's arrest or conviction for his
alleged role in the embassy bombings.
