AS NYC GROWS SAFER, CRIME LOOSENS ITS GRIP ON THE NEWS

   NEW YORK _ It was a slow news day in the depths of summer.
Thirteen Ohio factory workers had won a $296 million lottery. The
Hamptons were gearing up for a visit by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different story to
lead its 6 p.m. newscast on July 30: Seven women had been harassed
over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester
County. Once, a man fondled himself as a woman passed by. Several
other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the
women, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even
sure if they had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem
an odd choice as the top news in the nation's largest city. In the
early 1990s, when the New York crime rate was much higher, the
report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast, much less
lead it.
</P>
<P>
   The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New
York's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the
city's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years. The
crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days
are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on sexual
attacks and child abuse. There are more reports on crimes in the
suburbs and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up
coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself,
including police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _
particularly in New York City's three major daily newspapers _
where change is most pronounced. In the first two weeks of May
1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in
The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
In the first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as
many articles about crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether,
including several on crimes in the suburbs. On many days in May,
there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post, where
once it was a staple.
</P>
<P>
   On local television news, which has been criticized for years
for its daily diet of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a
reduction as well, though much more modest. It is impossible to
quantify, because news directors at New York's major network-owned
stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of
old broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the
contents of local news four or more years ago. But many current and
former television news executives say that for many years at least
30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were
about crime. The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the
three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV,
WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer, and crime was
the subject of 27 percent of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of
the reports on local news shows, and many minutes of air time at
the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them. But on other
nights, crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable
decline of violent crime in New York, where the number of killings
has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year. At the current
rate, there would be fewer than 600 this year, the lowest total in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions,
especially by people who manage local television news operations,
to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports.
``There is a positive feeling overall, and I think reporters and
editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all live
in the same community,'' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey.
``We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result
of police department policies that make it more difficult to get
information on crime and access to police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a
day in New York City, on average, the basic question for crime
reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover. There was
seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police
Department as an institution. Crime news often crowded out other
subjects on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any
coverage,'' said Bart Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV.
``This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting
and diverse way. I think there is more commitment at all the
stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to
honest-to-goodness journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the
same assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress
their view. But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news
shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, local stations compensate for the murder gap by
covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local
crimes that, not long ago, would have passed unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to
Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police
cars on highways to counter road rage. Local stations also reported
in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold, N.J., accused
of stabbing his wife, a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx
motel and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism
on local stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had
difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed
by body bags.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock
market's slide might affect New York City's budget. The previous
week, a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign
advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S.
Senate.

   Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still
too much crime on local television. ``There's no question that it
is still the predominant item,'' said David Klatell, head of the
broadcast program at Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism. ``Television news has always been a much more emotive
and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime
persists even if the reality doesn't. It's much easier to cover
crime than to cover the school system or race relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to
study the content of local television news two years ago. They
analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the
1996-1997 television season. The survey showed that 27.2 percent of
the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime, well
above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent. A similar analysis of
the television season that ended last spring is not finished.
</P>
<P>
   Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news
cable station, with influencing coverage on the larger
network-owned stations. Since it started in 1992, NY1 has tried to
balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from
government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said
that his station was devoting less time to crime these days.
``Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the
day,'' he said, ``the police reporter is now more likely to be
covering police department issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause
journalists to react more strongly to major crimes. The decline in
crime means that ``those that do occur take on a prominence, seem
more newsworthy than they did in the past,'' said Daily News
managing editor Arthur Browne. ``There is an added shock value now
when they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another
factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share
information less readily and are generally less cooperative. Some
police reporters said that they could usually get enough
information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often
difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other
enterprise articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad
news out of the papers and off the screen,'' said Gabe Pressman,
the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news
in the city's papers is startling. On May 4, for example, there was
a single crime article in The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a
13-year-old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a
stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range. The Times, in
its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a
sexual abuse case in Syracuse. The following day, there were no
reports on crime in The News, The Times or The Post. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, there was one article in The Post, on page 7, about
the arrest of a substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting
students with a chair. The News put the same story on page 8, next
to an article about an investigation into whether police officers
had covered up for an off-duty detective involved in a car crash.
The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.
</P>
<P>
   That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's
tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the
Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really two possible explanations for this,'' said
Mitchell Stephens, acting chairman of the journalism department at
New York University. ``One is that the reality has changed and news
reflects reality. I tend to doubt that. The other is that
competitive organizational pressures in the news business are
responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called
``The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word,'' said the arrival of
New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in
the city. In time-honored American fashion, he said, newspapers
sought circulation by concentrating on crime. The death of New York
Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on
editors to pursue crime.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished
attention to crime by the New York news organizations. ``Maybe
people are feeling less paranoid,'' he said, ``and it is harder to
push those buttons.''
