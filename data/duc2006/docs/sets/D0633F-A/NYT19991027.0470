ARRESTS BY NEW JERSEY TROOPERS SHOW ANOTHER DROP IN SEPTEMBER  
(DW)

<P>
   Arrests by the New Jersey State Police were down 42 percent in
September from the same period last year, and the head of the state
troopers' union said Wednesday that he attributed the decline to
low morale and troopers' fear of being accused of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, which are published monthly, show a continuing
trend of fewer arrests since February, when Col. Carl A. Williams,
superintendent of the State Police, was forced to resign by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman. Williams had said in a newspaper interview
at the time that certain racial and ethnic groups dominate segments
of the illegal drug trade. In the month after the resignation, the
number of arrests also fell 42 percent; they had been up slightly
the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers made 1,042 arrests last month, 754 fewer than the 1,796
made in September 1998, according to figures released Tuesday. The
number of traffic summonses issued was also down, by about 10
percent, to 32,567 last month from 36,074 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Edward Lennon, president of the State Troopers Fraternal
Organization, said the decline _ the largest since March _
reflected troopers' poor morale and fears of being accused of
singling out minority drivers. It was on Sept. 7, Lennon said, that
Troopers John Hogan, 29, and James Kenna, 28, were indicted on
charges of attempted murder and assault in the April 1998 shooting
of three unarmed men, two of them black and one Hispanic, on the
New Jersey Turnpike. The incident led to widespread public
criticism as well as state and federal investigations of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think troopers are less likely to take the step further that
is required to initiate a patrol-related arrest,'' Lennon said.
``When they stop a car for speeding, they're issued a summons for
speeding, and the driver's on his way.'' There are indicators, like
a driver's nervousness, that might ordinarily prompt troopers to
search a car, he said, but ``it could be that they are ignoring
those indicators.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Police, would not
comment on Lennon's assertions. Hagerty said the decline could be
linked to the reassignment of 40 troopers to flood relief duty last
month or to a continuing decline in the overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that in 1998 we recorded a 9 percent drop in
crime, and the FBI is telling us we're looking at a similar decline
in 1999,'' he said. ``With declining crime rates, you're going to
have fewer arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty said troopers were also busier aiding drivers last
month, with 15,127 reports of assistance, compared with 14,277 in
September 1998. The number of warnings issued fell slightly, to
15,418 from 15,684.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police began publishing the monthly figures in April
at the recommendation of Peter G. Verniero, then the state attorney
general, to increase accountability and public confidence in the
force. Hagerty said he could not say whether either goal had been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Police get letters, pro and con, on a daily basis,'' he
said. ``Are we seeing a difference in the tone and nature of the
letters? Not necessarily.''
