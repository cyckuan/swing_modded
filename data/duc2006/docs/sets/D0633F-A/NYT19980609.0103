PATAKI PLANS CRIME-FIGHTING SYSTEM MODELED ON NEW YORK CITY
PROGRAM

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Borrowing from a crime-fighting tool used in New
York City, Gov. George Pataki has announced a pilot program
designed to help counties share crime data, map trends and nab more
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The program is modeled after New York City's successful Comstat
system, which turns dry crime statistics into maps of criminal hot
spots. Within a year, the state hopes to institute a similar
data-sharing system among 10 counties, with the hope that this will
help the police agencies map county-to-county trends, share
resources and confront crime more effectively. Officials hope to
expand the program statewide by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals don't abide by jurisdictional borders,'' Pataki,
Republican, said in announcing the program Monday. The pilot
program includes the counties that comprise the State Police Troop
G area, including Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady
counties.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's crime rate has plummeted during the time it has
been using the Comstat tracking system, fueling a statistical drop
in crime statewide. Murders dropped by 44 percent statewide between
1995 and 1997 and rapes have declined 15 percent, according to
projections made by the Department of Criminal Justice Services.
</P>
<P>
   But not all counties have seen such a dramatic drop. In
Rensselaer County, for example, violent crime increased 33 percent
between 1992 and 1996. Between 1996 and 1997, it jumped another 6
percent, according to the most recent statewide statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they
fear that as New York City's crime rate drops, criminals move
northward, where drugs fetch higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, 1,226 of the suspects arrested in Albany
said they were born in New York City, up from 644 in 1991, city
records show. A kilo of heroin that sells for as little as $75,000
in New York City can trade for as much as $180,000 in the Albany
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we do get some crime from New York
City,'' said Albany Police Chief Kevin Tuffey, adding that the
problem of dealing with the criminal commute north was the subject
of a law enforcement seminar held two weeks ago in New York City.
``That's what this will help us to track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration's pilot program is called the Crime
Analysis Partnerships to Upgrade Regional Enforcement, or CAPTURE.
</P>
<P>
   The CAPTURE system, which will cost an estimated $500,000 to
start, will enable the police in one area to tap into a program
that will tell them if the police in another jurisdiction have
encountered a similar crime pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (criminals) are moving in the direction of least
resistance,'' said Deputy Chief Jack Nielsen of the Albany Police
Department. ``This will help tell us where to shore up.''
</P>
<P>
   The details are still being worked out. But the program may
require the state to equip the smaller policing agencies with a
computer or a fax machine enabling them to provide data to the
state on a weekly or biweekly basis.
