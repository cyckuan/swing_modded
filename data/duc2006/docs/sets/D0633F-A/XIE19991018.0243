<HEADLINE> U.S. Crime Rate Continues to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in the United
States declined in 1998 for the seventh straight year, with the
murder and robbery rates being the lowest in three decades, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies
and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level
since 1985, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes
reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998,
down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989,
the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder
every 31 minutes, but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six
slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime
rate to "more police officers on the street, greater partnerships
between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns
away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes
prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision."
</P>
<P>
"This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can
indeed turn the tide on crime," President Bill Clinton said in a
statement. But he cautioned that "even as crime falls, we must
not let down our guard. That is why we must redouble our efforts
to build on what works."
</P>
<P>
The report also said firearms were used in 64.9 percent of
murders. Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported
used in the killings.
