   If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on
Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were
17 will have been put to death this year in the United States. That
is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were
executed in Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned youthful offenders _
those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while
they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row
population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the
ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of
attitudes about capital punishment in the United States. While 23
of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution
of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out
such executions since the death penalty was reinstated. Half of all
condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death
row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular
among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed
capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to
have the option to come back with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well
as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are
expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were,
according to most laws, still children when they committed their
crimes. The United States is one of only seven countries in the
world that permit such executions, according to the State
Department. Language prohibiting the practice is included in
several international human rights treaties, including the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States
and Somalia have not yet ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends my conscience to execute someone who was under 18
at the time of the crime,'' said District Attorney Joshua Marquis,
of Astoria, Ore., a member of the board of the National Association
of District Attorneys, who otherwise supports the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death
penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in 1989. The previous
year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and
unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that
constitutes a ban on such executions. No one younger than 16 at the
time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16
at the time of the crime has been executed. Of the 23 states that
permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried
out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that it is little surprise that most are Southern
states, since the South has the highest incarceration rate and the
highest execution rate in general. This year, Virginia and Texas
each executed two men who committed their crimes when they were
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders
charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death
penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in
1994. Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders
last year. Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in
the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund
oppose death sentences for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, several former prosecutors formed a group to
protect juvenile offenders last year when they learned their state
has four on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering all the ways the government failed our children _
from crack babies to horrible public schools to miserable health
care, we can at least ask the government not to willfully kill
them,'' said Zoe Sanders Nettles, a former prosecutor who helped
found the group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the
Execution of Children.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned
youthful offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was
white and female. The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were
all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men
or the rape of white girls. They were all between the ages of 17
and 19 when they were electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyers have asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and
Paroles to commute Williams' sentence to life imprisonment and are
planning a last-minute appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund
have condemned the sentencing to death of juvenile offenders and
have written letters to the pardons board on Williams's behalf.
Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, has also written, asking
that Williams' sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Carter wrote: ``As a society we traditionally have given special
consideration to children who commit crimes because we recognize
that they lack the maturity or the mental capacity to function as
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' cause has also been taken up by the European Union, a
measure of the repugnance other Western countries have for the
execution of juvenile offenders. A representative of the union met
with the Georgia pardons board Monday to present an ``urgent
humanitarian appeal'' for the sentence to be commuted to life
imprisonment, a European Union official said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of
the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S.
State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and
Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that
the only countries other than the United States to have carried out
such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that
time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty
International. China, which executes more people than any other
country in the world, formally banned the execution of juvenile
offenders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for
juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the prohibition in the U.N. treaty, the execution of
juvenile offenders is also banned under the International
Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The U.S. Senate voted to
ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute
juvenile offenders.

   The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647,
when 16-year-old Thomas Graunger was reportedly hanged in Plymouth
Colony for bestiality involving a cow and a horse, said Victor
Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty, and
the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
</P>
<P>
   Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say
that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme
expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among
politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as
tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent
years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as
adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their
youth as a mitigating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of
juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as
that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that
the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with
proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The empirical and moral question here is, at what age can we
be so sure of a person's inability to change in the context of an
attempt by society to change that person that we would sentence
that person to death?'' said Laurence Steinberg, a psychology
professor at Temple University and the director of the MacArthur
Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile
Justice. ``I don't think that 16 or 17 seems like a very reasonable
answer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and politicians who favor the
treatment of teen-age offenders as adults say the traditional
juvenile justice system was not set up to handle the numbers of
teen-agers who now have access to guns, and who commit the types of
crimes that are punished with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Williams was 17 in 1986 when he abducted 16-year-old
Aleta Bunch from a shopping mall in Augusta, Ga., then raped and
fatally shot her.
</P>
<P>
   Aleta's mother, Carolyn Bunch, said of her daughter's killer in
a recent interview, ``I don't care how old he was. He was old
enough to know better. I could pull the switch on him and never
have any remorse. He shot her three times in the forehead. He shot
her eye out. He shot her in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Craig, the district attorney in Augusta, said in an
interview that he opposes clemency for Williams because the jury
had ``determined that the appropriate response of a civilized
society is the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law, at 17 Williams was automatically charged as
an adult, but it was the prosecutor's decision to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is described in prison records as mentally ill: records
indicate he is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder, which
reportedly leads him to worship the actress Sigourney Weaver as god
and to dress as the Lone Ranger. As a juvenile, he was charged with
several offenses, including reckless conduct for holding a knife to
a 13-year-old classmate's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' sister, Alexsandriya Clemons, and half-brother, Rodney
Blair, have both sworn affidavits describing the abuse their mother
meted out to all of them as children. In an interview in Jackson,
Ga., last month, where they were visiting their brother on death
row, they said their mother had beaten them frequently with
electrical cords, frying pans, belts, barbells and a vacuum
cleaner. Their brother Alexander, they said, bore the brunt of the
worst abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time she was hitting his toes with a screwdriver and a
hammer,'' Clemons said.
</P>
<P>
   They said their mother, Pat Blair, held down three jobs while
supporting five children. She declined to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Alexander Williams' lawyer, O.L. Collins, who has
since died, did not present any of the details of his client's
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, four jurors, and a fifth this week, swore affidavits
stating that had they known about Williams' childhood abuse, and
his mental illness, they would not have voted to sentence him to
death. It is for that reason they, too, are asking Georgia's
pardons board to grant Williams clemency.

   Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders
on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families
marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness. As children
the offenders had to figure out ``how not to get beaten to a pulp
or sexually abused by one of the so-called adults who'd been placed
in charge of them,'' said Craig Haney, a professor of psychology at
the University of California at Santa Cruz, who has compiled the
social histories of many juvenile offenders on death row for
defense lawyers. That kind of early abuse can lead to aggression
and violence, Haney and other experts contend.
</P>
<P>
   Haney and other experts also say that the stereotypical image of
teen-age killers as superpredators who cannot be redeemed is not
borne out by scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who are cynical about the rehabilitation of adults
recognize that juveniles are different,'' Haney said. ``It's the
notion that human nature is unfolding. It's not until later in
someone's life that you're willing to throw up your hands and say
there is nothing more we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   But many law enforcement officials view these offenders
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial
of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant
manager in Mobile, Ala., in 1989. ``Gary Hart is a predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, who is on Alabama's death row, testified at trial
that an older man had given him and a friend instructions on how to
rob the restaurant. The shooting, he said, had been an accident.
Once he had cocked the gun, he did not know how to uncock it, he
said. He said he had taken the gun from the trunk of his mother's
car.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Simmons, who is on death row in Missouri, was 4 when
his stepfather began taking him to bars and pouring him drinks,
defense psychologists say. His stepfather would tie young
Christopher to a tree when he went fishing.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, in the course of a burglary in 1983, Christopher and a
15-year-old friend bound and gagged a 46-year-old woman and pushed
her into a river and she drowned. The 15-year-old was given life
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen years old,'' the prosecutor said of Christopher at
his trial. ``Doesn't that scare you? Mitigating? Quite the
contrary, I submit.'' The prosecutor suggested that Christopher's
family would be better off if he were executed. ``Show some mercy
to his family,'' he said. ``Give him death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hughes had a mother who was a schizophrenic and an
alcoholic, according to court records. Left alone by their mother
for weeks at a time, Kevin and his five siblings begged on the
streets of Philadelphia for money and food, according to affidavits
filed by several relatives. The mother had a series of violent
boyfriends, who beat and raped Kevin while his mother laughed,
according to the affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin got really bad beatings and whippings because he could
not understand things and was mentally slow,'' his oldest brother
said in his affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hughes, now 38, was 16 when he raped and strangled a
9-year-old girl, Rochelle Graham. He has been on death row in
Pennsylvania for 17 years.
