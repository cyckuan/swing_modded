 &HT;    
 &HT;    There is crime all around us, though the rates are generally
falling. Criminals come in all shapes and sizes, but tend to hail
from the lower classes of America, the poor, the rural poor, the
urban poor ... the underprivileged. The conclusion, then, is that
most criminal activity is by minorities because most of the poor
are minority people.
 &HT;    That is the logical conclusion and it is right. Right with a
couple of caveats: not all criminals come from the poor; and, most
criminals cannot read and write, despite their economic status.
 &HT;    First, who are the criminals? At least, who is in prison? Using
statistics published by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics we see that the number of whites in prison has increased
from 1990's 139 inmates per 100,000 whites, to 193 in 1996.
Following closely are Hispanics. I use the word ``closely'' in
humor, for Hispanic prisoners have increased from 548 per 100,000
in 1990 to 688 in 1996.
 &HT;    Hispanic prison numbers were obscene in 1990 and they are more
obscene today. But they are nothing compared to that of the blacks.
In 1990, there were 1,067 blacks in prison per 100,000, double the
Hispanic number and five times the white rate. In 1996, the 1,067
had increased by a third to an astounding 1,571.
 &HT;    So now we know who the criminals are; at least we know who the
stupid criminals are and the ones who couldn't afford good lawyers.
But, do we know why they are criminals? Are blacks and Hispanics a
criminal class as determined by race? Or is there some other
underlying reason?
 &HT;    Moreover, we still have whites in prison, don't we? And, there
was a day in American when 99 percent of prison inmates were white.
So, is it ethnicity? Was it ethnicity between 1840 and 1850 when
over half the arrests in New York City were of Irish immigrants?
 &HT;    Race and ethnicity have little, if anything, to do with
criminality and no one other than ``Bell Curve'' believers and
white supremacists think so. If race and ethnicity have little to
do with most criminality, what does? Sociopathology, of course,
accounts for crime among all races and ethnicities, but for our
purposes poverty and illiteracy are the answers.
 &HT;    We know from innumerable studies that the vast majority of
prisoners are illiterate or functionally illiterate. There are 1.8
million prisoners in American prisons and only a tiny percentage
can read or write. Most prisoners come from poor families.
 &HT;    Thus, can we connect the dots of poverty, illiteracy? Can we do
this without racial considerations? Yes, we can do both.
 &HT;    It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that, if whites
had an 8.6 percent poverty rate in 1996 (according to the Economic
Policy Institute) and blacks had a historically persistent 26.1
percent poverty rate, blacks would have a higher rate of
incarceration. But, it does take a rocket scientist to figure out
why Hispanics, who in recent years have surpassed the black poverty
rate for the first time, at 26.4 percent, have an incarceration
rate less than half that of blacks.
 &HT;    Part of the answer to Hispanic poverty is that so many Hispanics
have immigrated to the United States in recent years and they come
here for opportunity _ not prison. But, in literacy, blacks and
whites have approximately the same high school graduation rates and
we are bombarded with the perception that Hispanics have large
school dropout rates. So why such a gulf between blacks and
Hispanics in incarceration rates?
 &HT;    That gulf, by the way, leads us to another gulf: the one between
immigrant Hispanics and native-born Hispanics. Approximately 40
percent of Hispanics have immigrated here. Yet, among bona fide
immigrants, there are few criminals. Most of the foreign born
inmates are actually not immigrants but foreign nationals caught
smuggling everything from drugs to people. Among the native-born
Hispanics, about 300 per 100,000 are incarcerated, placing them
about a third higher than whites, but about a fifth of the black
level.
 &HT;    What do we now know? We know that if a child doesn't learn to
read and write, he will probably end up in prison. We know that if
a child grows up in poverty, he may wind up in prison. Poverty,
however, should have little bearing on whether a child learns to
read or write, for that is a skill learned in school and there are
plenty of schools in poor areas.
 &HT;    I don't speak here of college prep, or of high school dropouts,
just reading and writing. Think of all that could be saved in human
and prison costs if children could just learn to read and write _
learn from the teachers we pay to teach reading and writing.
 &HT;    But the astounding black crime rate will not be solved by
reading and writing, for those skills cannot obliterate almost 400
years of slavery, subjugation, segregation and hate that oppress
and depress the lives and the spirit of blacks _ a condition that
neither this writer nor the reader can imagine without being black.
