   WASHINGTON _ The nation's overall crime rate in 1997 fell for
the sixth consecutive year, with the rate of violent crimes such as
murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop, the FBI reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's big cities experienced the steepest decline in
their crime rate, with a 5 percent drop, while suburban counties
saw a decrease of 4 percent, and rural areas were down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the
drop to several factors, including the aging of baby boomers,
increased incarceration of criminals, declining use of crack,
additional police officers and better policing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996,
helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate by 3 percent, its
lowest level in over a decade, the FBI reported.
</P>
<P>
   Murders fell by more than 7 percent to 18,209. In the past four
years, the murder rate has plummeted by more than 25 percent.
Robberies fell 8 percent, while aggravated assaults and forcible
rapes decreased 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely continues the trend of good news about
crime,'' said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's
College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox cautioned: ``People should remember that these numbers
aren't the full story. In the coming years, these declines could
turn quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are
influencing the nation's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   First, the aging of the baby boom generation, which makes up 25
percent of the population, has pushed down the number of crimes
because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of crimes committed by teen-agers
has risen sharply since the mid-1980s. The number of murders
committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and
1995. And although the number of violent crimes committed by
juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years, the number of
teen-agers will grow quickly over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society
deals with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the
end of school and when most parents get home for dinner,'' he said.
``That tells you that our children are not getting enough
supervision from their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno
warned Americans not to ``relax their vigilance about crime, about
enforcement, about prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the large number of people growing through their teens
and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement
officials with a challenge, but that these kids do not have to
become criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure, as we have more young people, that we
have more programs for them, more opportunities to give them a
strong and positive future,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997, with
the Northeast experiencing the largest drop, 5 percent, the FBI
report said. The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3
percent, while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report also said the rate of property crimes, burglaries
and larceny fell 3 percent, while the rate of motor vehicle thefts
dropped 4 percent.

   The report noted that 65 law enforcement officers were killed in
the line of duty during 1997, nine more than in 1996. Of the slain
officers, 34 worked for city police departments, 20 for county
police and sheriff's offices, 9 for state agencies and 2 for
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the South was by far the most dangerous region for law
enforcement officers. Thirty-two officers were killed in that part
of the country last year, twice as many as next highest region, the
West, where 15 officers were slain. Eleven officers were killed in
the Midwest and seven in the Northeast.
