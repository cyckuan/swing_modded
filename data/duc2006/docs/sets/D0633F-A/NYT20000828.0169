TEXAS PRISON GROWTH IS FASTEST

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas prison system grew faster than any
other in the country over the past decade, and one out of every 20
adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice
system, according to national study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are
signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion,''
said Vincent Schiraldi, the director of the Justice Policy
Institute of Washington, D.C., and a co-author of the report,
``Texas Tough: An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the
Lone Star State.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute's study, Texas also has the nation's
largest populations of probationers and parolees.
</P>
<P>
   The report confirms statistics that have long been known to
state criminal justice policy analysts, and several proponents of
tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the
sentiments of most Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have this prison building boom by happenstance,''
said Dianne Clements, president of the crime-victims advocacy
group, Justice for All. ``It happened because the citizens and
taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no
longer abide a revolving-door prison system. We realize there is a
cost, and we are ready to foot the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   That cost was high and will probably get higher. In the early
1990s, Texas voters authorized spending $1.7 billion in bonds to
triple the size of the state's prison system, which now exceeds
150,000 beds.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers return to Austin in January, they will be asked
to send a $500 million bond package to the voters for the
construction of three maximum-security units.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 163,190 state inmates are in custody in Texas, compared
with 163,107 in California, according to the institute, which
supports alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, who heads the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council, which assesses prison needs for state lawmakers, said the
institute's figures include inmates housed in low-risk
substance-abuse treatment facilities and those in county jails
awaiting transfer to state facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Texas prison population's average annual increase of 11.8
percent during the 1990s was not only the highest growth in the
nation, but was almost twice the average annual growth of the other
states.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Texas were a country, it would have the highest
incarceration rate in the world, easily surpassing that of the
United States and Russia, the next two finishers, and would be
seven times that of the next biggest prison system in China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blacks in Texas are incarcerated at seven times the rate of
whites, and nearly one in three young African-American men in Texas
is under some form of criminal justice control.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is a think tank of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice, and the study was paid for with a grant from the
Center on Crime, Communities and Culture. The groups provide
programs for families of inmates and look for other solutions to
criminal behavior beyond prisons, such as substance abuse
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The institute determined that Texas added 98,000 inmates to its
prison system in the '90s, which is almost 25,000 more inmates than
the population of New York's entire system. Yet, since 1995, New
York's decline in crime was four times greater than that of Texas,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Texas have almost the same population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the crime rate declined much more slowly
in Texas than it did in other large states. From 1993 to 1998,
crime in the Lone Star State fell 5.1 percent, half the national
average, and the least of any of the nation's five largest states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If locking more people up really reduced crime, Texas should
have the lowest crime rate in the country,'' said Jason Ziedenberg,
another co-author of the study. ``The cost of having one in three
young black men under criminal justice control is a steep price to
pay for the states' lackluster crime declines.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, defended the state's criminal justice
policies as tough but fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing
with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to
let them know that there are consequences for their behavior,''
said Bush press aide Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the authors of that study might not understand is that
Texas also has been very aggressive in using rehabilitation efforts
and faith-based organizations to change people's hearts. The bottom
line to all these efforts is that, under Gov. Bush, Texas has the
lowest violent crime rate in 26 years and the lowest murder rate
since the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said Texas should be
receptive to critical assessments of its institutions and open to
suggestions of policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is helpful that groups such as this force us to
take a look at impact of our policies,'' Ellis said. ``I firmly
believe in punishing those who break the law, but these are some
pretty graphic statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize that our `lock them up and throw away the
key' mentality is costing us a lot of money. Maybe there is too
much emphasis on dealing with criminal justice issues on the back
end of life rather than on the front end.''
