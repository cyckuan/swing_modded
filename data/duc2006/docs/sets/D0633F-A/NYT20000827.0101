RATE OF VIOLENT CRIME DROPS 10 PERCENT IN 1999, CONTINUING DOWNWARD
TREND

   WASHINGTON _ The rate of violent crime in the United States
continued a downward trend in 1999, with the 10 percent drop last
year representing one of the largest decreases in decades, the
Justice Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures, released by the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics, show a continuation of declines in every major
type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999. During
this period, the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.7
percent, while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent, aggravated
assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, begun
in 1972, show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward
trend. Crime rates involving property, including burglary and motor
vehicle theft, dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999, decreasing from
217 per 1,000 U.S. households to 198 per 1,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were more secure in their homes from 1998 to 1999,
with the number of completed burglaries dropping from 38.5 per
1,000 households to 34.1 per 1,000, an 11.4 percent fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an
increase from 1980 to 1981, the burglary rate fell each year
through the rest of the period,'' the Justice Department report
said. ``The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of
the adjusted rate of 1973.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime
rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher
sentences and more police officers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   As with earlier reports of similar declines, President Clinton
called the figures ``further proof that the Clinton-Gore
administration's anticrime strategy of more police on our streets
and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest
America in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush's headquarters, told The Associated Press:
``It's typical for the Clinton-Gore administration to take credit
for good things in America. But much of the credit for the decline
in crime has to go to governors and local officials who have passed
tougher laws, longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime rate report is based upon information on nonlethal
violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National
Crime Victimization Survey. In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750
people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Although homicides were not included in the survey, the report
said preliminary data gathered separately by the FBI indicated that
the murder rate declined about 8 percent last year. Males account
for about three-quarters of murder victims. About one in eight of
these victims is under 18 years of age, and firearms are used in
seven of 10 homicides, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 44 percent of last year's violent crimes against
people were reported to police, compared with 34 percent of
property crimes. Robbery was the violent crime most often reported,
with 61 percent of incidents disclosed, while rape and other sexual
assaults were the least often brought to the attention of law
enforcement. Only 28 percent of these cases were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Males were more likely to be victims of violent crime, including
robbery and assault, than females in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Males experienced violent crime at rates 28 percent greater,
and were robbed at rates more than two times that of females,''
said the report. ``Females were victims of rape and sexual assault
at 7.5 times greater than the rate of males.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, it said, three females per 1,000 were raped or
sexually assaulted, compared with 0.4 per 1,000 for males.
