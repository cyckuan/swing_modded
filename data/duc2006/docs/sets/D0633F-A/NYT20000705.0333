   LOS ANGELES _ The California state prison system, which led the
huge national prison-building boom for years, has recorded the
first decline in its inmate population in more than two decades,
according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The drop, although tiny, has already caused some officials to
say that it is time for California to temporarily halt a prison
buildup that inspired spending in other states across the country,
and had a big effect on the state budget. At one point, in the
mid-1990s, California began spending more on prisons than for its
giant university system.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, California has spent $5.6 billion on prison
construction and, with increasingly tough laws for repeat
offenders, has had little trouble filling the new cells. ``But now
there are several prisons we aren't building,'' said C.A. Terhune,
the director of the Department of Corrections, on Wednesday.
``Frankly, it's a lot of money that the governor and the
Legislature can use for other social problems. We're still going to
need prisons, but at a much lower rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's prison population of 161,401 in late June was 360
fewer inmates than in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, 360 is a drop in the bucket,'' said Franklin
Zimring, an expert on prisons and a professor of law at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``The big news is that the
bucket didn't get any bigger this year. It's not the decline, it's
the absence of an advance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very good news, which we haven't seen nationally,''
Zimring added. ``Now, the question is to what extent is California
serving as a leading indicator for the rest of the country?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest states, at least, California seems to be the
only one actually experiencing a decline in the prison population,
according to officials around the country. Nationally, the prison
population continues to grow, although the rate has slowed over the
last five years.

   In Texas, which has the nation's second-largest prison
population, the number of inmates increased by 2.9 percent, to
150,359, from June 1999 to last month, officials there said. This
rate of increase was greater than it was the year before, but
significantly less than the 5 percent increase in the state's
prison population from June 1996 to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which has the third-largest prison population, had a
3.8 percent increase from June 1999 to last month, state officials
there said. The state's total prison population is 71,233. It
increased by just 0.6 percent from June 1996 to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Between June 1999 and last month, New York state experienced a
0.5 percent increase in its inmate population, bringing its total
to 71,021. The rate of growth was down significantly from the 1.7
percent increase in 1997. From 1997 to 1998, there was a 0.3
percent decrease in the state's prison population, then it rose the
next year with a 2 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to New York, James B. Flateau, spokesman for the New
York State Department of Correctional Services, said, ``The violent
population is still increasing, but the nonviolent population is
not. And any growth is attributable to violent offenders.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Terhune said the growth of the prison population in California
has been steadily slowing over the last three years. Between 1980
and 1989, the prison population grew by 14.5 percent a year. In the
1990s, the growth slowed to an average of 6.3 percent a year.
Terhune said it was still unclear whether the decline represents a
long-term trend or simply a short-term dip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm happy about it,'' he said. ``Growth was up to nearly
12,0000 a year. Considering what growth was, this is significant.''
He speculated that several factors played a role in the decline,
including a decrease in new inmates sentenced by courts, fewer
parole violators returned with new terms and a slowdown in the rate
of parole violators returned to custody.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in California also said they were increasingly turning
to alternatives to prison, such as drug rehabilitation programs and
additional parole.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring said the declines should have occurred years ago to
match the decline in the crime rate, which has been falling in
California since the early 1990s. ``The prison admission numbers
have finally caught up with the trends in crime,'' he said. ``This
is a state that has become almost addicted to massive increases in
punishment, and now it appears it has taken a vacation from that
attitude.'' Several large cities in other states have also reported
decreases in crime in recent years.

   California is still going ahead with plans to build a $335
million, 5,000 bed high-security prison in the town of Delano. But
it will be the last for several years, Terhune said, adding, ``We
can go five years without having to go to the Legislature for
additional construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Braz, a defense lawyer in Oakland and the program director
for Critical Resistance, a group that monitors prisons and criminal
justice issues, said the state's new numbers were evidence that the
Delano prison was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us hope,'' Braz said. ``The race to incarcerate may
finally be slowing down. Maybe people are really starting to
question the reliance on incarceration as the answer to
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But other states, such as Virginia, have experienced declines
one year only to see increases the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, as in so many things, is the leader in the nation,
both in things good and bad,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a professor
of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``The
drop in California is so small that it might just be noise, but it
could also be an indication that finally we're seeing the first
dove after the flood.''
