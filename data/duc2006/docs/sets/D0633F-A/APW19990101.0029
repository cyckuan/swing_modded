<HEADLINE> Chicago Is U.S. Murder Capital </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago is the nation's 1998 murder capital,  
despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to 
preliminary data from cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's  
homicide totals for the first time ever. New York has seen a 
dramatic drop in its homicides. There were 629 there last year, 
compared with a 1990 high of 2,262. 
</P>
<P>
	When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more  
than double that of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop  
in murders. There were 759 murders there in 1997. The last year 
murders numbered less than 700 was 1988, when there were 663. 
</P>
<P>
	``One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the  
numbers go down,'' Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited the city's community policing program for much of  
the decline. But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected 
to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest 
U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently  
in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 
1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities. In that same 
period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is upsetting and very disturbing that we have now passed  
New York City in the number of murders...,'' said Arthur Lurigio, 
chairman of the criminal justice department at Loyola University. 
``I am at a loss as to why Chicago's reductions are not 
commensurate to other large cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty levels in Chicago could account for some of the  
statistics, said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal 
Justice at Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chicago police officials hope their efforts will  
eventually pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making a long-term investment in our communities,  
making them places where neighbors feel safe and criminals feel 
unwelcome,'' Chicago Police Supt. Terry Hillard said. ``This 
process may take a little longer, but the long-term rewards are 
great -- steadily declining crime rates and increased quality of 
life.''
