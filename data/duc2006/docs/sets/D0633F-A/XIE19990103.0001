<HEADLINE> Chicago, U.S. Murder Capital: Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Chicago is the United States'
1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in
murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's
homicide totals for the first time ever. New York has seen a
dramatic drop in its homicides. There were 629 there last year,
compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
</P>
<P>
When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more
than double that of New York.
</P>
<P>
"One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the
numbers go down," Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
</P>
<P>
He credited the city's community policing program for much of
the decline. But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is
expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight
largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently
in the last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and
1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities. In that same
period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
