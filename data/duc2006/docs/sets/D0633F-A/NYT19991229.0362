EX-POLICE COMMISSIONER RELISHES BEING BACK IN HUNT FOR TERRORISTS

   WASHINGTON _ Six years after stepping down as New York City's
police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly finds himself playing cop
again _ this time as commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, with
a mission that includes tracking down terrorists who might try to
cross the borders in time for this week's millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like I never really left the beat,'' said Kelly, who
ran the New York City Police Department when terrorists bombed the
World Trade Center in 1993, the last deadly attack by foreign
terrorists on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, the Customs Service seems to have proved
that the potential millennium threat is real. On Dec. 14, customs
inspectors arrested an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, as he crossed
from Canada into Washington state. Prosecutors said his car was
packed with a nitroglycerine-like chemical and other bomb-making
components; he had a reservation at a motel in Seattle near the
Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle officials later canceled the public celebration there
because of security concerns. And five days after Ressam's arrest,
customs agents in Vermont detained two people who have since been
tied by prosecutors to Algerian militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly speaks somberly of what the arrests might suggest. ``We've
got to be concerned,'' he said, his stocky, compact frame and thick
New York accent bringing Jimmy Cagney to mind. ``I think you've got
to be realistic. You can't sugarcoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly knows what terrorists bent on slaughter can do. He
recalled rushing to the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, when a
bomb unleashed a fireball, killing six people and leaving a
seven-story crater where a parking garage had been. ``The thing I
remember most vividly,'' he said, ``was looking down and seeing
this hole, this huge hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, the solemnity in Kelly's voice gives way to
his obvious excitement at how the Customs Service, among the least
glamorous of law enforcement agencies, has found itself on the
front lines of the war against terrorism. ``Yes, absolutely, I feel
energized, invigorated,'' he said. He is convinced that the
professionalism of his agents in Washington state prevented a
terrorist attack. ``There's no question about it. They're heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest prompted President Clinton to announce a heightened
state of alert for federal law enforcement agencies. In the last
two weeks, Kelly has added 500 inspectors to border stations.
``Will there be more searches? Yes,'' he said. ``Will there be more
interviews with people? Yes. Are there going to be some delays?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   This whirlwind of excitement is a reminder of why he told
Clinton last year that he wanted to run the Customs Service. It was
technically a demotion from his last job, as the Treasury
Department's undersecretary for enforcement, a post in which he
supervised not only the Customs Service but also the Secret Service
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a step down, but it was an inside-the-beltway step
down,'' he said. ``Undersecretary was a policy job, and that's
fine, and I enjoyed it. But this is more fun. This is a law
enforcement organization. I feel more comfortable here. I'm much
more comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   There were worries earlier this year that Kelly might have to
cut short his tenure. In June, he had a heart bypass operation.
``This was a shock to me,'' said Kelly, a 58-year-old Marine Corps
veteran who always prided himself on staying in shape. He was back
at work within days of the surgery and has resumed his daily visits
to the gym in his condominium complex, spending 40 minutes on a
treadmill before hitting the weights.
</P>
<P>
   As New York's police commissioner, Kelly had a resume drawn up
by central casting. The youngest of five children, he was raised in
a building at Columbus Avenue and 91st Street in Manhattan _ ``It's
now a McDonald's,'' he says with a sigh _ before moving to Queens
as a teen-ager. His father, a milkman, later worked for the
Internal Revenue Service. His one sister worked in the fashion
industry before retiring. Like his three brothers, Kelly joined the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to civilian life after fighting in Vietnam. While
working in the stockroom in the baby clothes department at Macy's,
Kelly saw a recruiting ad for the police. He registered at the
Police Academy, graduating first in a class of 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure as police commissioner was brief _ only 18 months _
but Kelly was praised for his performance, both for the overall
decline in the crime rate and for his sensitivity to racial
concerns. Jimmy Breslin, the newspaper columnist, described him as
``a city treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he had long wondered what else he might have
accomplished had Mayor Rudolph Giuliani not decided, shortly after
his election in November 1993, to find a new commissioner.
``Giuliani had the absolute right to pick his own police
commissioner,'' he said. ``But crime was down every day on my
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He still sees plenty of New York, where his wife, who sells
medical equipment, lives in their apartment in Battery Park City in
Lower Manhattan. ``We have a commuting deal, and she'll come down
to Washington virtually every weekend if I don't go up,'' he said.
He is always glad to go up. ``I'm a New Yorker,'' he said. ``That's
my home.''
