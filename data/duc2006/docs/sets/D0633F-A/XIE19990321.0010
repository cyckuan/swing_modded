<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Federal-State Anti-Gun Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered his government Saturday to develop a plan for closer
federal-state cooperation to increase prosecution of criminals who
use firearms and to take other steps aimed at reducing gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton claimed the country's
crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent since 1993, and the
rate of murders by firearms has fallen by 33 percent. But he said
that far too many people still are killed by guns. In 1997, 14,000
people were killed by guns.
</P>
<P>
"Guns have magnified the malevolence of crime," Clinton said,
adding that disarming criminals should be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
Clinton put Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney
General Janet Reno in charge of developing a strategy against gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
He singled out Project Exile, headed by the U.S. attorney in
Richmond in cooperation with state, local and other federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said hundreds of firearms have been seized and hundreds
of criminals who used firearms convicted. The key to the project,
he said, is using existing federal laws as the backbone of
the enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeated what his budget for the next fiscal year is
proposing to help cut firearm-related crime, including 5 million
U.S. dollars for dozens of new federal prosecutors and 23.8
million dollars for more than 120 new agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
