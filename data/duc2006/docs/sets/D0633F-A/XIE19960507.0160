<HEADLINE> FBI: Atlanta Rated Most Violent City in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At a time when the opening of the
1996 summer Olympic Games is drawing, the host city, Atlant, was
rated as the most violent city in the United States by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics.
</P>
<P>
The FBI figures revealed Sunday show that while crime
nationwide fell 2 percent in 1995, crime in Atlanta rose 4 percent
in the year. The figures make Atlanta's crime rate the highest
among U.S. cities of 250,000 or more people. It topped the
rankings in both violent and non-violent crime.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games (ACOG) said, "This is not representative of a lack of
preparation for the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
"If people who come here will follow instructions, I think
they'll be in the most secure place on Earth," said A.D. Frazier,
chief operating officer of the ACOG.
</P>
<P>
ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the
Games, with more than 25,000 federal, state and local law
enforcement officers and military personnel. They will be assisted
by thousands of agents from the FBI, CIA and other secret services.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the worst, security forces held a series of
anti-terrorism exercises in the city last month, and law
enforcement officers uncovered a underground bomb factory in
central Georgia and arrested two men.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that ACOG security officials have travelled to
foreign countries to get advice on anti-terrorist tactics.
