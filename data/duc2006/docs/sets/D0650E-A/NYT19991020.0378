 &HT;    Blindness prevention part of Carter's vision
 &HT;    By Keith Graham

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Carter was talking about vision.
</P>
<P>
   No, not grand sweep, big picture kind of vision.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the United States was talking about the
failing eyesight of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 75, was haunted by the image of a 2-year-old boy he had
seen last weekend in the poor West African nation of Mali.
</P>
<P>
   The boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called
trachoma, which has blinded 6 million people and infects millions
more.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmother has already been blinded by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy, the former president said, still ``has a chance''
of keeping his eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster from Mali and others like him will have more of a
chance, thanks to new programs the Carter Center is announcing
today.
</P>
<P>
   Grants from the Lions Clubs International Foundation and the
Conrad N. Hilton Foundation _ totaling almost $30 million _ will
allow the Atlanta-based center to expand its existing blindness
treatment and prevention programs in Africa and Latin America and
start new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The first trachoma program is cranking up in Mali, where the
Carter Center has had great success in fighting another illness,
Guinea worm disease. From there, trachoma programs will expand to
Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center has been combating another eye disease, river
blindness, since 1987 and will expand those programs to additional
countries with help from the new grants.
</P>
<P>
   Both ailments have symptoms that can make your stomach churn.
</P>
<P>
   River blindness, which infects 18 million people, is spread when
parasites enter the body through bites from black flies. It has
terrible side effects, Carter said. ``You get itching that is worse
than poison ivy. ... Large sores form on your body where the
micro-organism ... breeds, and the skin changes color so it looks
like you've got leprosy. And then it takes about 12 years for a
person to go blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma begins with an inflammation of the upper eyelid that
causes scarring. The eyelid turns inward and the movement of
eyelashes causes painful scratches on the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Again, flies are culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrendous,'' Carter said, ``in that it starts with
little children because they're not educated well enough or
competent to keeps the flies out of their eyes. It's just
disgusting to a Westerner to see the little child when he opens his
eyes might have 10 flies trying to get moisture out of his eyes.
... And he's not even aware of the fact that he ought to brush them
away. And, of course, the filth builds up on the eye and then it
becomes infected.''
</P>
<P>
   But both diseases are relatively easy to treat.
</P>
<P>
   River blindness is ``treated quite simply with one tablet a year
that Merck &AMP; Co. gives us,'' Carter said. The center has
distributed 17 million of those annual doses so far and expects to
give out more than 6 million in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a person with river blindness, they would rather have that
one pill a year than to have a diamond the same size,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply improving hygiene can prevent trachoma. But Pfizer Inc.
is donating pills that are also effective in treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To get such programs going, Carter starts at the top, meeting
with a country's president and relevant ministers of government.
The programs are administered at the grass-roots level, partly
through existing health arms of the governments but also with the
help of local Lions Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The service organization has been committed to fighting
blindness since it was challenged in 1925 by Helen Keller. Carter
himself is a longtime Lion. He was elected to be a district
governor of the organization before he was elected governor of
Georgia. Today the Lions have grown to 44,500 clubs in 185
countries, including most developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Hilton Foundation _ which is chipping in
$13.6 million over 10 years for Carter Center blindness prevention
programs _ and the Lions Clubs _ which are providing $16 million
over five years _ traveled with Carter to Mali last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ervin of Albany is the president of Lions Clubs
International. He confessed to ``very strange'' feelings as he saw
people suffering from ailments so easily preventable. But the Lions
believe the Carter Center programs will be effective because they
are designed to help people help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin praised the local Lions who will take part in the
programs, including those already assisting the Carter Center in
Nigeria, Cameroon and Sudan. And he praised one aging Lion in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   In the parts of Africa where the Carter Center has worked, Ervin
said, Jimmy Carter is looked on ``almost as a savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, if you were a 2-year-old boy with trachoma _ or the
people who love that child _ you could see why.
