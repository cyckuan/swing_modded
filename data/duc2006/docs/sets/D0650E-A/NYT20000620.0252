 &HT;    FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER TO OBSERVE MEXICO ELECTION

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will be in
Mexico on July 2 to observe this country's highly competitive
presidential election, an elections monitoring groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to Carter came during an exploratory visit last
week by representatives of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based
non-profit group concerned with democracy and that has observed
elections in more than a dozen countries in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are a watershed for Mexico,'' Carter said in a
statement. ``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of
the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and
activities the confidence of the international community in the
Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory University professor Robert Pastor, principle advisor to
the delegation, said during the center's exploratory visit in
Mexico allegations of vote-buying, coercion and other pre-election
irregularities were raised by parties trying to unseat Mexico's
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate concerns we are looking at,'' Pastor
said. But, he added, ``it's not enough to have anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has gone through sweeping electoral reforms since its
last presidential election in 1994. Polls are showing that the two
top candidates in the race are Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox
Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential election looks to be a very close race,''
Pastor said. ``While we were impressed by the trust that all
parties had in the Federal Elections Institute (which conducts the
balloting), we were persuaded of the need for a delegation by the
leaders of all three
</P>
<P>
   parties, some of whom shared their deep concerns about the
potential for serious irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties hope that Carter's presence might ``deter
irregularities and give people the confidence to vote their
conscience,'' Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ambassador to the United States Jesus F. Reyes-Heroles
sent a letter telling Carter his presence would be of ``remarkable
importance'' to the election.
