   JAKARTA &UR;  &LR; _ Jimmy Carter has monitored more than 20 elections in
16 countries since he left the White House, and not all of them
were showcases of democracy. In Panama in 1989, he went on national
television to denounce ballot tampering by General Manuel Noriega.
In 1992 in Guyana, thugs who had been menacing voters threatened
his life.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia, where voters went to the polls two days ago for
their first free election in 44 years, seems to have defied the
cynics. A year after bloody riots forced President Suharto from
power, more than 100 million Indonesians exercised their democratic
rights in a process that, so far, seems to have been largely fair
and peaceful, Carter said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grades we've given . . . are very good,'' Carter said,
after reviewing preliminary reports from 50 teams sent out by his
Atlanta-based Carter Center. The observers visited up to 1,000
sites across Indonesia's vast archipelago. The balloting he
observed was ``very meticulous, almost excruciatingly so,'' the
former US president said. He described poll workers reciting the
oath of honesty, reading the election commissioner's speech aloud,
shaking out ballot boxes publicly to demonstrate they were empty
before the voting, and counting unused ballots to make sure the
numbers were right.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing in a traditional Indonesian batik shirt, Carter told a
small group of reporters that it is too early to tell if the
election as a whole will be fair, since votes are still being
tabulated. But citing widespread reports of vigilant voters
crowding poll stations to watch the counting, Carter said he was
optimistic that ``that part will be so highly scrutinized by the
public that improprieties will be revealed and corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a marked contrast with Panama 10 years ago, when
President Noriega deployed armed soldiers dressed in civilian
clothes to seize voting sheets at night and replace them with new
ballots the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't speak much Spanish,'' Carter said, but he went on
national television that day to denounce the vote-fixing. ``I'm
still not sure what I said,'' he added with a laugh, but ``I used
the word fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Tandjung, chairman of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party,
said Tuesday he would respect the election result, whatever the
outcome. Carter said he was confident all rival parties would do
the same, but he observed that, counting aside, he has ``never seen
so complicated a process to choose a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that debuted Monday, citizens voted for 462
national parliamentarians and 135 regional councilors. Another 65
representatives from underrepresented groups will be appointed
later, probably by parliament, and the military will appoint 38
representatives of its own. That national assembly of 700 people
will choose a president in November.
</P>
<P>
   The process, Carter warned, leaves the door open for efforts to
buy assembly members' votes. He urged that the constitution be
amended to allow direct presidential elections in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also met jailed East Timor resistance leader Xanana
Gusmao, and said the next big test for Indonesia will be the
planned Aug. 8 referendum in the disputed province. Pro-Jakarta
militias have launched a bloody fight against independence
activists recently, putting the safety and fairness of that vote in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's assessment of the voting echoed the relief and guarded
praise voiced by other foreign observers. Domestic groups were more
cautious, pointing out several isolated violations and calling for
fresh voting in the province of Aceh, where 15,000 people were
reportedly prevented from voting because of threats by separatists
or the military.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge will be in the counting. Only 2 percent of
more than 100 million ballots had been counted. Officials said the
final tally may not be known until June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Smita Notosusanto, executive director of the University Network
for Free and Fair Election, said part of the delay is because
ballots are tabulated at polling stations and then recounted at
village, subdistrict, district, and provincial levels. What is
more, she added, ``The computer system is a total mess ... and in
some areas they have to carry votes by horseback or canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Notosusanto warned that ``most of the cheating comes after the
voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were apparently heartened by the vote. The
International Monetary Fund approved a $450 million loan on Monday,
the battered Indonesian currency strengthened, and stocks soared 12
percent Tuesday, finishing at the highest level since August 1997,
when the Asian economic crisis began.
