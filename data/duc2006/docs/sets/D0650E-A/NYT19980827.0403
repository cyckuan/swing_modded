 &HT;    Coca Cola donates $1.5 million to strengthen Latin American
relations

<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Coca-Cola Co. Thursday gave $1.5 million to the
Carter Center and Emory University to help build stronger relations
with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center envisions using its share of the five-year
donation to initiate a project called ``Transparency for Growth in
the Americas.'' After years of promoting democracy in Latin
American countries, the Carter Center now is turning its attention
to combating corruption by urging ``transparency,'' or openness, in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer McCoy, director of the Carter Center's Latin American
and Caribbean Program, said the objective of the initiative is to
ensure that public transactions are fair and accountable. The hope
is that the Carter Center will be able to work with Latin leaders
and the international community to curtail bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center plans to work with its Council of Freely
Elected Heads of Governments, a group of 31 current and former
Latin leaders working on democratic reform and economic development
in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to the Coca-Cola Co. for helping make this
happen,'' McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which has strong economic and political ties
throughout Latin America, expressed no reservations about the new
focus of the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for all of us,'' said Timothy J. Haas, president
of Coca-Cola's Latin America Group, adding that businesses like
Coca-Cola flourish ``in free-market environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas said that the Coca-Cola Co. does not have any control over
Carter Center projects, but he is not concerned about any backlash
that could affect his company from the Carter Center's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly can stand the scrutiny of any spotlight,'' Haas
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to get its message out, the Carter Center plans to hold
a series of high-level conferences over the next five years where
it will invite leaders from throughout the Americas. The first
summit will be May 4-5, 1999, in conjunction with the annual CNN
World Report conference. The center also will work with Latin
American governments to encourage transparency in their
transactions. Already, McCoy said they have begun discussions with
leaders in Costa Rica, Jamaica and Equador.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University will use its share of the Coca-Cola donation to
provide 15 scholarships for Latin American students.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowships will provide an annual stipend for six students
entering the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and will cover
part of the tuition costs for nine students entering the Goizueta
Business School's MBA program.
</P>
<P>
   Emory President William M. Chace said the Coca-Cola gift will
help to further internationalize the campus _ providing a benefit
to both its current students and the Latin American scholars. The
hope is that the Latin scholars will return to their home countries
and contribute to the region's development.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Coca-Cola/Carter Center/Emory partnership
originated two years ago in conversations between Pedro Pablo Diaz,
Coca-Cola's vice president of communications for Latin America, and
Bob Pastor, who until recently headed the Carter Center's Latin
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was endorsed by the late Coca-Cola CEO Roberto C.
Goizueta, who was born in Cuba and was a strong proponent of closer
ties between Atlanta and Latin America, and M. Douglas Ivester,
Coca-Cola's current CEO.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the partnership is part of a ``growing momentum for
Atlanta to be the new gateway toward Latin America.''
