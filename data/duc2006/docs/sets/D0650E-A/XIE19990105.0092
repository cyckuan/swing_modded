<HEADLINE> U.S. Delegation Observes Direct Election of People's Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Carter
Center of the United States, led by Charles E Costello, director
of the center's democracy program, arrived in Beijing this evening
to observe the election of township-level people's deputies.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the National People's Congress (NPC) Foreign Affairs
Committee, the delegation is scheduled to discuss grass-roots
democracy issues with officials from both the NPC and the Ministry
of Civil Affairs, and observe the direct elections of people's
deputies in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality during its
10-day inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for an overseas non-governmental
organization to inspect elections of China's local power organs,
since the Carter Center's two previous inspections of villagers'
committee elections in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his
wife, the Carter Center has been devoted to observing many
countries in respect of democracy and development, human rights
issues and public health.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Carter Center has monitored elections in at least
12 countries, and the inspection of China's villagers' committee
over the past two years has proven to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Pastor, who headed the center's two inspection
delegations to China, said on his last trip,"Our entire delegation
was impressed by what we saw and by the commitment of the
villagers to have free and fair elections, by the competition, and
by the sincerity with which the Chinese officials try to make this
election successful."
