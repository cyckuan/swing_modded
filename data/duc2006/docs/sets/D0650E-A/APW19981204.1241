	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The events that allowed a former coup
plotter to become front-runner in Sunday's presidential vote
indicate that Venezuelans are fed up with the status quo, said
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
	   ``I personally see the developments in Venezuela as a
demonstration of democracy in its truest form,'' Carter said
Friday.
	   He is heading a 40-person team of international election
monitors that includes former presidents Patricio Aylwin of Chile
and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia and Nicholas Brady, an
ex-U.S. treasury secretary.
	   Also expected is a separate observer delegation headed by former
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, now secretary general of the
Organization of American States.
	   ``Correctly or incorrectly, the people of Venezuela seem to have
lost confidence in the domination of the two major political
parties in the country,'' Carter said in explaining the meteoric
rise of Hugo Chavez, who as an army lieutenant colonel led an
ill-fated 1992 coup attempt.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of
Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections _ a major setback for the
country's two traditional political parties.
	   Carter did not specifically mention Chavez, or his main
challenger, Henrique Salas Romer, referring to them only as
``independent candidates.''
	   But he said the rise of the independents and the uncertainty
surrounding the election were the reasons he and his team from the
Atlanta-based Carter Center were invited to observe Sunday's
balloting.
	   Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have
observed in 10 Latin American nations.
