   MEXICO CITY _ Jimmy Carter remembers fighting fraud back in
Georgia in the 1960s, when one rival in a state election controlled
all the welfare checks in town and pulled ballots out of boxes at
his pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It was with this background that Carter came to Mexico to watch
this country's historic presidential election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Mexico,'' said surprised voters who recognized the
former U.S. president as he strode into the Museum of the School of
Medicine, a handsome stone colonial building in downtown Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was where the Spanish inquisition took place,'' Carter
said, gazing around the inner patio where a polling station was set
up.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Carter was witnessing a more progressive step in
Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what
is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential
election ever in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think they're trying to do it right,'' Carter said.
He praised the technical aspects of Mexico's new balloting system
and officials he met at the Federal Elections Institute, an
independent agency supervising the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe this could be an election too close to call.
Preliminary returns that could give even a hint of the winner are
not expected before early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which
has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years, is facing a
tough challenge from center-right candidate Vicente Fox. And the
PRI, as a Carter report on the elections noted, has been criticized
by opponents for coercing poor people and government workers to
vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt there's been widespread
attempts by the PRI to use its incumbency,'' he said. ``But I know
incumbency can cut both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   A party that has long held power, he said, is vulnerable if
voters are dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, assessing the fairness of the vote, said that if voters
truly believe they can vote in secret, they turn to their
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the School of Medicine, he noted the curtained
white booths where voters marked ballots only after checking in
with officials who compared their photo ID cards against
registration lists with copies of photos and names.
</P>
<P>
   Signs on the booths read, ``Your vote is free and secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many favors they've been promised or how many
threats they've received, we hope the voters should know their vote
is secret,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up thumbs smudged with indelible ink, voter Jose Luis
Jimenez rushed up to greet Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to have him here,'' the high school teacher
said. He said he voted for the PRI's Francisco Labastida because
its candidate has experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter left, voter Antonio Arreguin, 49, said, ``The
former president? I wished I had seen him.'' He said he voted for
Fox ``because Mexico really needs a change.''
