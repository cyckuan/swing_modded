   MEXICO CITY _ Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that
opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to
coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said at a news conference that two top opposition
candidates had told him they would accept the results of the
election _ which could be very close _ if the balloting is deemed
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two opposition parties have expressed to us their deep
concerns about some of the events that they say have occurred in
the pre-election process (and) with what they say is improper use
of government resources and influence,'' said Carter, who is in
Mexico to observe the elections with the Atlanta-based Carter
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the government is headed by a major party that has been
in power now for more than 70 years,'' Carter said, ``this is
grounds, I think, for concern and for careful observation.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival here Friday, Carter met with opposition
candidate Vicente Fox of the Alliance for Change, who opinion polls
show stands a chance of defeating, for the first time in 71 years,
Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also met with opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of
the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, running third in the
polls, and with PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who raised
concerns that his opponents might not accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that depends on the quality of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the voting process and the counting of the ballots and the
reporting of the results are deemed to be transparent and without
flaws of any significant degree,'' Carter said, ``they indeed will
accept the results of the election _ even though they retain the
right to criticize some previous activities during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter praised Mexico's ``superb'' new balloting system and said
that attempts at fraud on election day would probably be ``minimal
and reportable, if it does occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not categorize Mexico as a democracy 10 years ago,''
Carter said, but advances in election reform have been substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, allegations have been mounting that PRI government
officials are doling out social aid in exchange for votes or
telling social-aid recipients to vote for the PRI or lose their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, if there is evidence of wrongdoing it should
be punished,'' said Labastida spokesman Javier Trevino in response
to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma published a
transcript of what it said was a taped telephone conversation of
the governor of Michoacan state mentioning hiding state funds and
funneling money to PRI candidates in local elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is defamation,'' said Victor Tinoco, the governor, in
response to the report, challenging Reforma to prove the tape was
real.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an executive at the government-owned Mexican Oil
Company said a pressure campaign existed inside the company to
recruit PRI votes. Carter met with the executive and his wife, who
is also an employee.
</P>
<P>
   A special section of Mexican attorney general's office is
investigating this allegation and others. But the opposition is
complaining there is little time before the election to resolve
cases and punish perpetrators.
