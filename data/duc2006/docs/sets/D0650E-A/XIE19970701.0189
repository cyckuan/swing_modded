<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Governorship Election Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The much-speculated postponement of
Nigeria's governorship election to next year was confirmed during
a meeting between Head of State General Sani Abacha and former
U.S. president Jimmy Carter on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Abuja, the capital, at the end of his
two-day visit to Nigeria, Carter said General Abacha confirmed
the shift to him, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
But Carter gave no details of the election originally
scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year according to the
military administration's three-year transition to civil rule
program announced in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
"He was pleading with me that although the election of
governors for this year will not be held as scheduled in October,
the governorship election will be held next year, the same year
as election for president," Carter added.
</P>
<P>
He said Abacha reassured him on certain decisions made by the
government to have free and democratic elections so that the
October 1, 1998 military disengagement date could be realized.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president said there was no assurance yet on
the release of former head of state General Obasanjo and
Major-General Yar'Adua imprisoned on alleged involvement of a
coup, as well as the detention of Chief M.K.O. Abiola for alleged
treason. Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled
presidential election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Their imprisonment was the cause of the lingering strained
relations between Nigeria and America, said Carter, now head of
the Carter Center, a foundation committed to the eradication of
Guinea-worm and river blindness in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said: "A lot of problems have been brought about by the
fact that the rule of law in Nigeria has not been prosecuted
properly."
</P>
<P>
However, while kicking against the imposition of further
sanctions on Nigeria, Carter said he would see improved
diplomatic ties between Abuja and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have imposed sanctions on Nigeria since the
military administration's execution of nine minority nationality
activists in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The alleged poor human rights record in the country has come
under fresh attack from Britain and the U.S., with the new
British Labor government vowing that it would not compromise its
tough stand until there is a positive change by the military
government.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) has invited
Nigeria's opposition National Democratic Coalition and several
pro-democracy groups to London for discussion on the country's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, expected for July 10, are to enable CMAG to
decide whether the suspension slammed on Nigeria two years ago
should be lifted, retained or even changed to expulsion.
