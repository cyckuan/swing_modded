ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been awarded by an
international organization, Carter Center of the USA, for being
the first Asian country to eradicate the Guinea Worm disease, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The award was presented to the representative of the Embassy of
Pakistan in the United States by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter at a special ceremony held in Atlanta recently.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimated in 1986 that more than
3 million people annually became infested with Guinea Worm in
tropical Africa, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan initiated its Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1987,
and was the first country in Asia to eradicate the disease two
years ahead of the global target.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the disease get the roundworms from stagnant,
untreated drinking water, which could grow in the body to reach a
length of two to three feet.
</P>
<P>
The mature worms burrow toward the skin and release poison that
destroys tissue, causing a blister or abscess. As many as 40 worms
wriggle from one person.
