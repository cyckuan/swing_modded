<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President
Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to
monitor the on- going transition program in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, he
said his center and the U.S. National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs would send a 40-to-50-member team to observe
the February 27 presidential polls which would draw the curtain on
the transfer of power from the military to civilians on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations are monitoring all phases of the local,
state and national elections in the west African country, The Post
Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Carter said the observation of the transit
program was designed "to support and call international attention
to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society."
</P>
<P>
While in the country, he will meet Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, leaders of the three political
parties, the Independent National Electoral Commission and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said Thursday that
his organization was satisfied with the progress of the on-going
transition program in Nigeria, according to local newspaper The
Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku who is on a working holiday in the country said
"Nigeria will definitely return (to Commonwealth) on May 29 as
long as the nation continues to show respect for fundamental
values such as democracy, human rights, the rule of law and
independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the 53-nation Commonwealth in 1995
following the hanging of nine Ogoni minority rights activists by
the military government of late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief said "the people of Nigeria demonstrated
keenness and eagerness to have democracy and the election is a
reflection of the will of the electorate."
