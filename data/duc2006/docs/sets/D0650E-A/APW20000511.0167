   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- The Atlanta-based
Carter Center will send 24 elections observers to the Dominican
Republic to monitor May 16 elections, a spokeswoman said Thursday.

   Spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the delegation would not
include former President Jimmy Carter, despite reports in local
newspapers that Carter and four other former heads of state would
be observers.

   Hoping for a repeat of the 1996 elections, which were praised as
the Caribbean country's fairest vote ever, Dominican officials have
invited monitors from around the world to help observe polling.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Elections Board said Wednesday it had accredited a
host of former heads of state to serve as elections observers,
including Carter, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez,
ex-President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela and former President
Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador.

<P>
   So far only former Colombian President Belisario Betancur has
said he would attend, the board said. The Colombian Embassy said
Thursday it had received no word of a visit by Betancur.
