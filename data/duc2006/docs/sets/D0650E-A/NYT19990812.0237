 &HT;    Carters deserve special acclaim

   ATLANTA _ Not to minimize the accomplishments of the other eight
Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients honored this week, but it
was fitting that President Clinton just happened to make a separate
presentation in Atlanta to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. Why? Because
the man and the woman from Plains deserve to be singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a happy coincidence. Clinton was scheduled to be here
Monday anyway to address the American Bar Association convention.
So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former
president and his first lady at the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   It has become something of a cliche to refer to Carter as the
greatest ex-president in the nation's history, a tribute to
countless good works he has done since he was defeated for
re-election nearly two decades ago. But Clinton, in his remarks,
noted thoughtfully that the ``greatest ex-president'' label does
Carter an injustice because everything he has done since leaving
the White House is an extension of priorities that characterized
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Did we say countless good works? In his medal citation, Clinton
attached some impressive numbers to Carter's record of service to
humanity: The 115 countries Carter has visited either on missions
to promote peace and human rights or to combat disease and hunger.
The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture
nascent democracies. The millions of Africans spared the scourges
of river blindness and Guinea worm disease thanks to the work of
his center. The dozens of political prisoners released because of
his personal intervention. The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter, too, has earned the admiration of the nation for
carrying through on causes that were dear to her even before her
years in the White House and the Georgia Governor's Mansion,
especially her work to improve treatment of mental illnesses and to
make child immunizations widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Carter acknowledged Monday that he and Rosalynn left the White
House somewhat deflated after his election defeat in 1980, but they
managed to build new lives full of pleasure, adventure and
challenge. That should be an instructive example for a youngish
ex-president-to-be who is concerned about his own place in history.
