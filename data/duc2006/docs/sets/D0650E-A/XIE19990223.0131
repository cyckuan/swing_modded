LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Observers from the Organization

the peaceful manner in Nigeria's National Assembly election and
described the election as a qualified success, local press
reported Tuesday.

In a statement issued in capital Abuja Monday, OAU group leader
Daniel Antonio said that "the polling process has so far been
peaceful, open and enabled all eligible voters to exercise their
franchise."

While the OAU observers note that the turn-out was low, the
statement said, "we believe that Nigerians will turn out in
greater numbers to select their next president."

The 52-member observer group said that it was impressed with
the conduct of all the polling officials, emphasizing that the
democratic process was not only important for Nigeria but for
Africa as a whole.

The EU observer group issued a statement in Abuja on Monday,

judged a qualified success," adding the problems noted did not mar
the credibility of the over- all result.

one of the most important elections that President Jimmy Carter
has observed to date.

He noted that Carter regards the Nigerian election as the most
 important of the year "because if the transition to civilian rule
works in Nigeria, it could change the course of history in West
Africa."
