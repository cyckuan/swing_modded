<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Deployed to 38 Locations in Liberia </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Troops of the West African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, have been deployed to 38
locations outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
This will make things easy for ECOMOG to dispatch troops to
all voting centers across the country to keep order for the
forthcoming May 30 elections, the report said, quoting ECOMOG
Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Malu made the remarks during a meeting on Wednesday with a
delegation of the Carter Center, a US-based organization working
in furtherance of democratic elections around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all sea ports and most of the border
crossing points were now being effectively policed by ECOMOG to
further enhance security nationwide, prevent arms movement in or
out of Liberia and give confidence to returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general reiterated ECOMOG was working hard to
ensure that the elections would be conducted in a very
transparent and honest environment so that if a party lost, such
party would know that it lost because the Liberian people
rejected it and not because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was already fully prepared to deal with such situation
under which anyone attempted to cause trouble after such an
honest election, Malu warned.
</P>
<P>
According to Gordon Streeb, leader of the delegation, the
former US president Jimmy Carter would lead a delegation of about
60 observers to Liberia as a reflection of the importance the
center attaches to the success of the country's post-war
elections.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Carter and his delegation to monitor the
elections is also seen as part of efforts to enhance the
credibility of the polls.
