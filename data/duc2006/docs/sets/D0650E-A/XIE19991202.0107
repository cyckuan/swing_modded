KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa, where 99 percent of the
river blindness cases occur, will receive greater portion of a
total sum of 16 million U.S. dollars to be provided by the Carter
Center, the center said in a press release available here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the fund will be used in the prevention of
blindness in Africa, Latin America and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Through the Global 2000 River Blindness Program in
collaboration with the National and District Health Services, the
center has been involved in the control of river blindness in
Uganda since 1996.
</P>
<P>
River blindness is controlled through community directed
treatment in endemic communities. Cases of river blindness in
Uganda have mostly been discovered in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The funds received will make it possible for the Carter Center
to strengthen existing programs and develop others.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center, founded by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, has been fighting blindness since 1987.
</P>
<P>
This humanitarian effort is bringing relief to the affected
individuals and their communities and freeing them to undertake
socially and economically beneficial ventures.
