	   IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are
initially for pain relief. This is followed by drugs that stop the
underlying disease process and reduce inflammation.
	   Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and
pain-relieving medicines are used to control them. They include
paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
locally applied linaments and ointments.
	   In the last five years, a better understanding of various
rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies.
	   That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant
treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example,
cyclosporin.
	   In the last two years, Cox-2 selective NSAIDs (meloxicam) have
been introduced around the world for pain relief in rheumatic
disorders. They are said to be safer than existing NSAIDs in
causing less gastrointestinal complications.
	   Up to now, all existing NSAIDs are known to cause gastric
irritation.
	   A certain herbal product has been tried in rheumatic disorders
in Denmark. It is based on the patented ginger extract HMP-33 which
is extracted from a special variety of ginger found only in one
particular region in China.
	   Developed over six years by a Danish team led by biochemist Dr
Morten Weidner, it comes in a soft gelatin capsule. It was recently
introduced here and is available over the counter.
	   Apparently, one capsule has properties equivalent to 6,600mg of
dried ginger.
	   The largest and most recent trial to test the efficacy and
safety of HMP-33 was conducted two years ago by a team of doctors
from Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, headed by chief rheumatologist
Dr Henning Bliddal and principal clinical investigator Dr Allan
Rosetzsky.
	   Dr Bliddal and his team had carried out a random double-blind
placebo-controlled study on 56 hospital patients suffering from
osteoarthritis.
	   The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from
bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects.
	   Similar clinical studies are currently being carried out in
Australia and the United States.
	   Generally, says a local doctor who requested anonymity, herbal
products are not as well tested in clinical trials as medications
which have to be registered for use in hospital pharmacies.
	   He adds trials with ginger extracts in rheumatic disorders have
not been actively carried out in Malaysia and local doctors are
awaiting confirmatory tests before recommending such products to
patients.
	   Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying
disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for
rheumatic patients.
	   Some patients may need disease modifying drugs to prevent
fibrosis of the tissues and joints and possibly internal organ
damage. Examples of such drugs include sulphasalazine, chloroquine,
penicillamine, gold and methotrexate.
	   Steroids in the correct amount and for the proper duration of
treatment are given to patients to reduce inflammation which may
damage the body.
	   However, these are also the most commonly abused drugs because
they are mixed illegally into herbal remedies.
	   Rheumatic disorders cover all medical diseases of the motoric
system - bones, joints, muscles and tendons - as well as those
related to the connective tissue.
	   The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis
elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
	   That means the treatment of each rheumatic disorder is
individualised and aimed at the cause and source of the pain as
well as underlying inflammation.
	   Based on Government hospital attendance records one in four
Malaysians above 40 visits outpatient clinics for a rheumatic
complaint. This is probably the same in private clinics.
