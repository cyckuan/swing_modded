MARKET PLACE: MONSANTO AND MERCK PUSHING NEW ARTHRITIS DRUGS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with
patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from Merck and
Monsanto have also been vying to get their attention to promote new
arthritis drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis
tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug. The
company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors
this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   But Merck is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of
months on the market. And it will soon begin a big advertising push
to compete with Monsanto's.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on
the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin. Can celebrity
endorsers be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty riding on this battle. Analysts expect the
market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from $7.2 billion
worldwide this year to $13 billion by 2005. And for their own
reasons, Merck and Monsanto want not just a success but a
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap is beginning to get interesting. Even though Celebrex,
which is being co-marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, controls the
market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in May.
Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as
replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like
ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   In the week ended June 11, Vioxx had 7 percent of the Cox-2
market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry
consultant IMS Health. But by July 23, Vioxx accounted for 22
percent of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex,''
said Jack Lamberton, a managing director at HSBC Securities. ``But
this market is large enough for both drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are unusually large. In an industry where earnings
tend to rise 15 percent or more a quarter, Monsanto and Merck need
a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After its proposed merger with American Home Products fell apart
last year, Monsanto announced a $625 million reorganization. Even
though drug makers are generally suffering and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's drug index is down 14.7 percent this year, Monsanto has done
worse. Its stock has slid 17.1 percent this year, to close Monday
at $39.375, up 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock
is down only 8.6 percent this year _ but analysts say the company
can ill afford a marketing disaster. Several of Merck's drugs will
lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the
company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives
become available.
</P>
<P>
   And Merck is no longer Wall Street's darling. During the last 12
months, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have climbed 18.6 percent.
Meanwhile, Merck's shares have gained 10.7 percent. They closed
Monday at $67.375, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis
drugs. After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up
their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about $2.3
billion a year sometime around 2004, up from a peak estimate of
$1.5 billion just months earlier. Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are
expected to be about $3 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness
of the brand,'' said Wendy Dixon, a Merck vice president. ``With a
condition that involves pain, people talk to each other. A lot of
the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla.,
suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief
three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor changed several of my medications,'' Reese said.
``But I have realized a marked improvement. My right hand is almost
normal, when it was about 60 percent functional before.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers
to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest
share of a new market seldom relinquishes it. Celebrex, whose sales
began in January, had the most successful debut by a drug ever in
the United States, eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra, Pfizer's
impotence pill, and Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's drug for reducing
cholesterol, according to IMS Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx,'' said Joseph
Papa, president of U.S. operations for Searle, a division of
Monsanto. ``We're outperforming them on every measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block. Known for
its Marine-like marketing efficiency, Merck began shipping Vioxx to
pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the
Food and Drug Administration. Merck has also distributed the most
free samples in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they
may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other
arthritis remedies.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Vioxx and Celebrex are safer on the gastrointestinal tract,''
said Dr. Steven Abramson, the chairman of Rheumatology at the
Hospital of Joint Diseases and the chairman of the FDA Advisory
Committee that reviewed both drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In comparisons between Vioxx and Celebrex, Merck would like to
focus on the two drugs' labels. Vioxx has an indication for
treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The Merck drug is also single-dose. Celebrex can be administered
in a single or double dose.
</P>
<P>
   Merck executives contend that Vioxx's single dose gives it an
advantage over Celebrex since patients usually want to take as few
pills as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has countered that Celebrex gives patients more
options. ``About 90 percent of the people who use Celebrex for
osteoarthritis take the 200-milligram pill once a day,'' Papa said.
``If someone wants the flexibility, they can take the 100-milligram
pill twice a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with doctors and consumers, health-maintenance
organizations may hold part of the key to the drugs' acceptance.
Several HMOs have restricted the use of one or both of the drugs.
Kaiser Permanente, which has 8.6 million members nationwide, has
limited the use of the drugs to people who are at high risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dr. David Campen, who chairs Kaiser's drug formulary
committee, notes that the plan will cover any drug a doctor
prescribes, he does not believe the plan should cover Vioxx and
Celebrex. Campen has recently sent out questionnaires to some 50
doctors, and expects to render a decision in September.
</P>
<P>
   The pills' prices might play a role. Vioxx is priced comparably
with Celebrex, which has an average wholesale price of $2.42 for
its once-a-day pill. But when patients use Celebrex twice a day,
the cost swells to $2.86. Both drugs cost considerably more than
traditional generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which run
about $1.70 for a daily dose.
