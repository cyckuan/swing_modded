   The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   `` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy
called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport
Beach, Calif. ``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety
of conditions this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West
keep expanding. Inserting needles into pressure points throughout
the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
</P>
<P>
   But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents
a whole new concept in cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles
underneath the skin,'' says Woo. ``Stimulating energy centers
restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach,
California. ``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened,
and my smile lines diminished a lot. I'm most pleased about that.''
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles
that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture
treatments. But inviting as the treatment seems, not many
acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders
with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain,
adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility. ``It opens the
channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's
cells. The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and
strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease
their anxiety. ``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by
first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of
steel. They don't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed
atmosphere. The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from
patient to patient. Some require as few as nine, and others need 16
or so placed strategically around their face. ``The needles bring
more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo,
``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells. The needles
activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more
elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   NEEDLE PLACEMENT
</P>
<P>
   After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape
to put pressure on the muscles. Anesthesia cream is applied to the
sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort. Then he inserts the needles
at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top
of the head. This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in
place for about a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate
circulation to the face. ``It's the same pressure point used to
stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the
needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes. A
Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin. Ten
treatments usually do the job. Then, maintenance visits once or
twice a month renew the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   EASY TO KEEP UP
</P>
<P>
   Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45
for each acupuncture treatment. Woo explains that restoring the
essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and
increases a sense of well being. This shows in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling
sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says. ``That is then
followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of
Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to
achieving beauty than a surgical facelift. The focus on the whole
person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years
even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that. But if I can
put it off, that's a good idea, I think. Acupuncture seems like a
better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to
keep up. And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time. I
enjoy the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY
</P>
<P>
   A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health
states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have
used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the field still remains relatively new to the public,
issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need
further clarification. The majority of states offer licensure or
registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the
same credentialing exam. A nationally recognized exam has been
established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed
acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical
devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and
hypodermic syringes. This ensures good manufacturing practices and
high standards of sterility. The FDA recommends that the needles be
used only once.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that
acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation
after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back
pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and
fibromyalgia. The consensus panel concluded that further research
is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture
interventions will be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all
encompassing way for some patients. ``I feel like I'm brighter,''
says Sandy Ridout. ``It gives me a better feeling just to know I
don't have wrinkles. ``I'm a preventive type person, and my
appearance and my mood are important to me. I needed a perker-upper
and this is it.''
