 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the summer of 1994, a surgeon named J. Bruce Moseley found
himself engaged in an elaborate form of make-believe.
 &HT;    Moseley had 10 patients scheduled for an operation intended to
relieve the arthritis pain in their knees.
 &HT;    The patients were men _ most of them middle-aged, all former
military guys _ and they weren't ready to consign themselves to the
rocking chair yet.
 &HT;    So they had decided to take a risk and volunteer for a study
that must have sounded, when Moseley first told them about it,
rather peculiar. All 10 would be wheeled into an operating room at
the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, draped, examined and
anesthetized. All 10 would be dispatched to the recovery room and
sent home from the hospital by the next morning equipped with
crutches and a painkiller.
 &HT;    But there the similarities ended. For while two of the men would
undergo the standard arthroscopic surgery for their condition _ the
scraping and rinsing of the knee joint _ and three would have the
rinsing alone, five would have no recognized surgical procedure at
all. Their surgery would be a placebo, an exercise in just pretend.
 &HT;    Moseley would stab the placebo patients' knees three times with
a scalpel _ to make it feel and look real, there had to be
incisions and later, scars _ but that was it. And he couldn't break
character.
 &HT;    If he knew in advance which kind of surgery he was to perform,
he might somehow give it away, so it wasn't until he entered the
gleaming OR, scrubbed and in his greens, that he opened an envelope
telling him whether he was doing a real procedure or a fake one
that time. Only the anesthetist and the nurse assisting him were in
on the secret.
 &HT;    In some ways, Moseley was an unlikely actor for such a role. As
a surgeon and a team physician for the Houston Rockets, he wasn't
the kind of doctor given to woolly introspection about the
Mind-Body Problem. He was simply skeptical about the specific
benefit of arthroscopic surgery for arthritis of the knee and
wanted to test its efficacy.
 &HT;    Then Moseley started talking with a doctor named Nelda Wray who
had been put in charge of health care research at the Houston VA,
and she asked him a startling question: How did he know that
whatever benefit came from this surgery wasn't a product of the
placebo effect _ that is, that those who improved did so not
because the operation actually healed the knee joint but because
they expected it would?
 &HT;    ``I said: 'It can't be,''' Moseley recalls. ``'This is surgery
we're talking about.' And she said: 'You're all wrong. The bigger
and more dramatic the patient perceives the intervention to be, the
bigger the placebo effect. Big pills have more than small pills,
injections have more than pills and surgery has the most of all.'''
 &HT;    Moseley was intrigued, but before he could begin his study, it
had to be approved by the institutional review board at Baylor and
by the human-studies committee at the VA.
 &HT;    ``My first reaction was what anybody's would be,'' says Baruch
Brody, an ethicist who consulted with the committees. ``I said:
'You're going to do what? Cut people up, pretending to do surgery
when you're not?'''
 &HT;    But Brody, like the rest of the reviewers, eventually came
around to the idea. Arthroscopic knee surgery typically requires
general anesthesia, which carries risks; the placebo procedure
required only a sedative and was cheaper. If patients responded
just as favorably to a placebo, why continue with arthroscopy?
 &HT;    The placebo worked. Six months after surgery, the 10 patients
still didn't know whether they had been faked out or not. But all
of them reported much less pain. None were unhappy with the outcome
of the operation.
 &HT;    This was a pilot study _ far too small to offer any definitive
conclusions about the efficacy of arthroscopic surgery for
osteoarthritis. But it was suggestive enough to set Moseley and
Wray on an expanded version of the same research design _ this time
with 180 patients _ for which they expect to have the results next
October.
 &HT;    Sylvester Colligan, a 76-year-old World War II veteran from
Beaumont, Tex., was assigned to the placebo group in Moseley and
Wray's expanded study. Colligan's right knee had been giving him
trouble for five years when a doctor at his local clinic told him
he probably had arthritis and suggested he talk to Moseley.
 &HT;    ``I was very impressed with him, especially when I heard he was
the team doctor with the Rockets,'' says Colligan, a courteous,
soft-spoken retiree who worked for the local Coca-Cola bottling
plant, first as an assistant to the driver of a delivery truck and
eventually as an account manager. ``So, sure, I went ahead and
signed up for this new thing he was doing.''
 &HT;    Colligan doesn't sound all that at ease with the term placebo,
but he does know his surgery consisted of only shallow incisions.
More important, he knows that he has no pain in his knee now and
that he can mow his yard again and walk wherever he wants.
 &HT;    ``The surgery was two years ago and the knee never has bothered
me since,'' he says. ``It's just like my other knee now. I give a
whole lot of credit to Dr. Moseley. Whenever I see him on the TV
during a basketball game, I call the wife in and say, 'Hey, there's
the doctor that fixed my knee!'''
 &HT;    That operating-room fakery should exert a therapeutic effect on
a patient is a remarkable notion. And yet it may be that the
symbolic armature of surgery _ the shedding of blood, the cultural
prestige of surgeons, even the scars that call to mind a dramatic
act of healing _ is itself a powerful force in recovery. It may be
that ``placebo surgery'' isn't such an oxymoron after all.
 &HT;    Forty years ago, a young Seattle cardiologist named Leonard Cobb
conducted a unique trial of a procedure then commonly used for
angina, in which doctors made small incisions in the chest and tied
knots in two arteries to try to increase blood flow to the heart.
 &HT;    It was a popular technique _ 90 percent of patients reported
that it helped _ but when Cobb compared it with placebo surgery in
which he made incisions but did not tie off the arteries, the sham
operations proved just as successful. The procedure, known as
internal mammary ligation, was soon abandoned.
 &HT;    Over the next decades, the whole idea of placebo surgery fell
out of favor with ethicists and patient advocates. If placebo
surgery didn't violate the Hippocratic edict ``First, do no harm,''
what did?
 &HT;    Now, though, that taboo is fading, and Moseley and Wray are not
the only ones arguing that new surgical techniques, like new
medicines, ought to be tested with placebo controls.
 &HT;    Doctors investigating a new technique for treating Parkinson's
disease, for example, incorporated a placebo control group _
patients who had holes drilled in their skulls to simulate the real
procedure, in which fetal cells are implanted in the brain _ into a
widely publicized study released last April.
 &HT;    The study showed a significant placebo effect, though the motor
ability of the patients who actually got the fetal implants
improved even more.
 &HT;    ``This is just the beginning,'' Dr. C. Warren Olanow, chairman
of neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, told Time magazine.
``Tomorrow, if you have a new procedure, you will have to do a
double-blind placebo trial.''
 &HT;    Some doctors argue, with reason, that the new enthusiasm for
placebo surgery is driven by hospital bean counters and insurers
who want hard evidence that an expensive procedure works before
they'll pay for it. And yet, with all due respect for medical
economics, that can't be the only explanation.
 &HT;    If placebo surgery makes sense, it makes sense because of the
growing body of evidence for the strength of the placebo effect in
general. Maybe pretend operations are just the most sensational
proof of a diffuse phenomenon that has never quite been explained,
but that, as the historian of science Anne Harrington has written,
continues to ``haunt our house of biomedical objectivity.''
 &HT;    The truth is that the placebo effect is huge _ anywhere between
35 and 75 percent of patients benefit from taking a dummy pill in
studies of new drugs _ so huge, in fact, that it should probably be
put to conscious use in clinical practice, even if we do not
entirely understand how it works.
 &HT;    For centuries, Western medicine consisted of almost nothing but
the placebo effect. The patient who got better after a bleeding _
or a dose of fox lung, wood lice, tartar emetic or any of the other
charming staples of the 19th-century pharmacopoeia _ got better
either in spite of them or because of their symbolic value.
 &HT;    Such patients believed in the cure and in the authority of the
bewigged gentlemen administering it, and the belief gave them hope
and the hope helped make them well. There were exceptions _
remedies, like quinine for malaria, the vaccine for smallpox and
morphine for pain relief, that actually worked.
 &HT;    But generally speaking, if all the drugs of the day ``could be
sunk to the bottom of the sea,'' as Oliver Wendell Holmes observed
in 1860, ``it would be all the better for mankind _ and all the
worse for the fishes.''
 &HT;    In an influential article first published in 1955, the Harvard
researcher Henry Beecher concluded that between 30 percent and 40
percent of any treated group would respond to a placebo. But
studies since then have shown placebos working for certain
conditions _ pain, depression, some heart ailments, gastric ulcers
and other stomach complaints _ in closer to 50 or 60 percent of
subjects, sometimes more.
 &HT;    For years, scientists have tried to come up with a plausible
explanation for the placebo effect, and there are by now several
contenders.
 &HT;    One is classical conditioning: People who have experienced
relief in medical settings or from ingesting a pill are primed,
like Pavlov's dogs, to do the same again. Another is the release of
endorphins: several studies have suggested that placebo pain
relievers, at least, work by stimulating the brain's own
analgesics.
 &HT;    Still a third is that taking a placebo, especially if it is
administered in an atmosphere of hope, relieves stress, which tends
to aggravate the symptoms of placebo-sensitive conditions like
asthma and hypertension.
 &HT;    What all of these explanations have in common _ for they are
certainly not mutually exclusive _ is the element of expectation,
the promise of help on the way that can only be imparted by another
human being.
 &HT;    This kind of hope seems particularly relevant when you respect
the distinction made by Dr. Howard M. Spiro, one of the most
thoughtful writers on the placebo, between illness and disease:
Illness is what the patient feels; disease is what the doctor
finds. Hope can help soften the experience of illness, though it
cannot cure the underlying disease.
 &HT;    In fact, there is hard data to support the notion that the
emotional alliance between a doctor and patient is itself a
therapeutic force _ that a compassionate and optimistic physician
can be, as one writer puts it, a walking placebo, that words can be
physically comforting.
 &HT;    In a study on postoperative pain conducted at Massachusetts
General Hospital, half of the patients were randomly chosen to be
visited by the anesthetist the night before surgery and treated,
poor dears, in a brusque, offhand manner.
 &HT;    ``My name is so-and-so,'' the doctor would say. ``Tomorrow I'm
going to give you anesthesia. Don't worry; everything is going to
be all right,'' and then off he'd go.
 &HT;    The same anesthetist visited the other group of patients and
this time put on a warm and sympathetic face, holding their hands
as he sat on their beds, telling them exactly what to expect in the
way of postop pain and assuring them that pain relief would be
available.
 &HT;    Those in the second group ended up requiring only half the
amount of painkilling medication and were discharged an average of
2.6 days earlier.
 &HT;    To be sure, the physician who can marshal a placebo response
with words and manner probably comes closest to what many of us
would think of as the profession's ideal - the kind of doctor who
seems wholly committed to our welfare, not the insurance company's;
who knows when and how to give us hope, who listens closely but
doesn't feel constrained from delivering advice; who knows us
because she has taken the time to know us.
 &HT;    ``The placebo effect can occur,'' as the physician Herbert
Spiegel once put it, ``when conditions are optimal for hope, faith,
trust and love.'' It might sound sentimental, but then sentiment,
working hand in hand with science, can make medical practice so
much more powerful.
 &HT;    A world in which placebo _ preferably in the form of deft
encouragement, but sometimes in the form of a harmless pill _ was
tolerated, even embraced, would be a world in which doctors never
forgot that medical practice consists not only of the technologies
of diagnosis and treatment but also of the careful tending of a
patient's expectations and the unabashed willingness to comfort.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which doctors kept in mind the uses of
optimism, knowing that there is, as Brown points out, ``a great
difference between telling a patient, 'This is a very powerful
painkiller,' and saying, 'This might help your pain a bit''' _ and
that they might as well give the former speech if they're going to
bother prescribing medicine at all.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which many of us might feel a lot better.
