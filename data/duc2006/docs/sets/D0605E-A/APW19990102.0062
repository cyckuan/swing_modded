<HEADLINE> Celebrex Ruling Benefits Merck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto will be first to sell a revolutionary  
type of arthritis medication, but its battle with Merck &AMP; Co. in 
the high stakes painkiller drug wars is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, made by Monsanto's Searle pharmaceutical unit, on  
Thursday became the first ``cox-2'' inhibitor to win Food and Drug 
Administration approval. The drugs have been touted as possibly the 
next wonder pills because of their promise to be easier on 
patients' stomachs than existing medications. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monsanto was dealt a blow when the FDA declared there is no  
proof that Celebrex actually is safer for patients' stomachs than 
older painkillers. As a result, when Celebrex hits retail outlets 
next month it must bear the same warning about side effects as many 
of its older competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, which is awaiting FDA approval for its Vioxx drug,  
another cox-2 pill, hopes to get a less stern warning label. One 
reason Merck was behind Monsanto in seeking federal approval is 
because it was waiting for the results of some longer term studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning label could be a key driver of physician use, and  
whether either drug reaches the $1 billion in annual sales that 
some Wall Street analysts had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck also hopes to gain another advantage by getting approval  
for Vioxx to be taken only once a day for arthritis users. The 
recommended dose of Celebrex is once or twice a day for 
osteoarthritis, and twice a day for rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merck may be able to use Monsanto's experience to get a better  
label,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FDA ruling Thursday, shares of Monsanto rose $1.19 to  
$47.50. Pfizer, which will be co-marketing Celebrex, fell $1.12 to 
$125. Merck shares dropped $1.31 to $147.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck spokesman John Bloomfield refused to speculate whether the  
company has enough research results to get a better warning label 
than Monsanto. Merck is working closely with the FDA to demonstrate 
that Vioxx has safety advantages over existing drugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pretty darn happy,'' said Scarlett Lee Foster, a  
Monsanto spokeswoman. ``I think we got a label we can use...to have 
the drug widely accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto is continuing to study Celebrex in hopes of providing  
FDA with enough evidence to advertise Celebrex as a safer 
painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, and a host  
of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or 
NSAIDs for arthritis and other pains. NSAIDS can cause ulcers, 
stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects, and are 
blamed for causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized every year, 
and for killing 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said it will price Celebrex comparably to other  
prescription strength painkillers that cost about $2.40 a day. With 
the traditional safety warnings on Celebrex, Monsanto would have 
faced considerable difficulty convincing insurers to pay any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the warning label issue, the government approval of  
Celebrex is a boost for Monsanto, which last summer had to drop 
plans to merge with American Home Products, maker of Robitussin 
cough syrup and Advil pain reliever. The $33.6 billion marriage 
would have been the biggest merger ever in the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto, based in St. Louis, makes the artificial sweetener  
Nutrasweet and is also heavily involved in genetic research for 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This adds credibility to their pipeline,'' said Sano Shimda,  
president of BioScience Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	And the FDA approval is a boost for Pfizer, who some analysts  
feared would grow too dependent on its anti-impotence drug Viagra 
to spur sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck knows that being first to market with a new class of drugs  
is no guarantee of long-term success. Merck held the lead in 
cholesterol lowering drugs with its Zocor drug, but Warner Lambert 
in the last two years has taken the market lead with its Lipitor 
pill.
