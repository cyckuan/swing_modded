   HOUSTON _ Orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, a clinical associate
professor at Baylor College of Medicine, was skeptical about a
commonplace operation performed on the painful knees of older
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The patients suffered from osteoarthritis, a crippling,
irreversible condition in which the cartilage covering the bones
has worn away with age. It is the major cause of mobility loss
among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Arthroscopic surgery, in which doctors work through tiny
incisions using a ``scope'' to see, is effective in repairing torn
cartilage from injuries. It cannot replace the missing cartilage in
arthritic patients; doctors can only wash out the joint and scrape,
or debride, the rough spots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly everyone said their arthritic knee pain decreased
after surgery. The question was, why?
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual, groundbreaking study, Moseley and other Houston
researchers are comparing actual surgery to phony, or placebo,
surgery to see whether the operation really helps _ or if people
simply believe it relieves their pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they better because of the procedure or the placebo
effect?'' said Dr. Nelda Wray, an internist who runs a research
unit financed by Baylor College of Medicine and Veterans Affairs.
``(Moseley's) argument was, `we don't know why they hurt in the
first place, and whether this works.'''
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which
people experience an improvement in their condition in response to
a phony therapy, such as a sugar pill. Scientists have recently
begun looking at placebos in the context of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Moseley, who is best known as the team physician for
the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, was
interested in comparing the benefits of rinsing and scraping the
knee joint vs. rinsing alone. He suspected that washing away debris
was what actually gave people relief.
</P>
<P>
   When Wray suggested that they also take a look at the placebo
effect, Moseley was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `What do you mean placebo? This is surgery!'''
Moseley said. ``The more we learned about it, the more we realized
surgery may have the strongest placebo effect of any
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   A pilot study of 10 patients yielded intriguing results. Five of
the patients received placebo surgery, just three shallow nicks on
their skin so their knees would look like the other patients'.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after sham surgery, patients reported the same amount
of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real
operation. Four of the five placebo patients said the surgery was
so worthwhile that they would recommend it to a friend. One patient
even requested the operation be repeated on the other knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from the (medical) literature on the placebo effect
that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is
greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said. ``If the
pill is bigger, you'll measure a bigger effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Wray suspects that people get better just from an encounter with
a surgeon. The white lab coat, the dramatic setting, the
declaration of ``I'm going to make you better'' have a powerful
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the current study, the doctors are comparing 180 patients at
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center divided into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment gives patients a shot at a $2,000 to $5,000
procedure that the VA does not usually offer for arthritis because
of its questionable benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty are getting their knee joints scraped and rinsed, 60 are
getting the rinse only, and 60 are getting no surgery at all. All
of the patients are given a mild sedative and all awake 30 minutes
later, but only the ones getting a surgical procedure receive full
anesthesia. Patients will be tracked for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the doctors met resistance from hospital
administrators when they proposed the study.
</P>
<P>
   To answer concerns about informed consent, participants were
required to state, in their own handwriting, that they understood
there was a one-third chance they would get placebo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A more difficult question was how doctors could justify giving
placebo patients a sedative, even if the risk of adverse reaction
was tiny. The answer came simply by looking at the question from
another angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year
getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch
Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy
at Baylor, who helped design the study. Brody reasoned that the
risks posed by an unproven surgical procedure were far greater than
those from a sedative.
</P>
<P>
   The study will be finished next year, with results scheduled to
be published in October 2000. If researchers find out the surgery
is clearly beneficial, ``we should probably be doing it more than
we're doing now,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   But if sham surgery works as well as or better than real
surgery, will doctors recommend that everyone get the placebo
operation?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what we're going to propose,'' Moseley said.
``We'll have to say that as expensive as arthroscopy surgery (for
arthritis) is, we probably can redirect those resources in a better
way for treatment of arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Gilbert, a VA patient who lives near Cleveland, Texas,
signed up for the current study two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old water-well drill contractor recently completed
his follow-up visits and learned he had actual surgery _ and he's
convinced it worked.
</P>
<P>
   A hand grenade in the Korean War paralyzed his left knee, and
osteoarthritis in his right knee worsened over the years until he
could only walk a few steps.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after surgery, Gilbert was walking. Soon, he could
jump and run _ and he didn't care whether it was because of sham
surgery or the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter. It stopped the pain,'' he said. ``I didn't
wonder what it was.''
