<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Universities to Join Studies on Mind-Body Relationships </HEADLINE>

LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two universities in the
United States said Thursday that they have received a five-year
grant to establish a center for the joint study of mind-body
interactions and health.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the center is to understand how the mind
influences the development of and recovery from diverse diseases,
including infectious diseases, osteoarthritis, early
cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, said the University of
Pittsburgh and Camegie Mellon University in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The grant of 10 million U.S. dollars the two universities in
Pittsburgh have received was from the National Institute of Health
(NIH), which funded four other centers for this initiative.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the establishment of the new center, researchers at
both universities have undertaken individual studies of mind-body
interactions and health.
</P>
<P>
They found that women with increased anger or hostility have a
greater risk for coronary artery disease, and people who have a
larger support network of friends and relatives get sick less
often than those who lead solitary lives. One study shows that
osteoarthritis has the potential to compromise the health of
family members as a result of the patient's negative responses to
symptoms and the burden of providing emotional support and task
assistance to the patient.
</P>
<P>
At the new center, researchers will study the risk for
respiratory illnesses such as the flu which may be affected by the
health of an individual's material and non-material relationships.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on older adults with osteoarthritis, researchers will
determine if the patients and their spousal caregivers experience
greater health benefits from an educational intervention targeted
at both rather than just at the patient.
</P>
<P>
Doctors will also examine women's perception of stress, their
attitude and coping responses as well as physiological reactions
to the stress in their lives as potential markers of risk for
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
Finally researchers hope to learn whether psychosocial
interventions can be designed to enhance adjustment and lower
recurrence and mortality among women with early breast cancer and
to find out the psychological, behavioral and biological
mechanisms through which the interventions operate.
