<HEADLINE> Drug Found To Curb Menstrual Pain </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vioxx, the highly anticipated new pain pill from  
Merck &AMP; Co. Inc. that promises to be easier on the stomach than 
aspirin, works well in relieving menstrual and post-surgical pain, 
according to two company studies unveiled today at a medical 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after  
obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an  
aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, 
according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the 
American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San 
Antonio, Texas. The study found pain relief was sustained for at 
least 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove  
their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain 
relief as ibuprofen. The dental study also showed one 50 milligram 
Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours. Ibuprofen must 
be taken at least three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain  
medications which work as well as aspirin and other 
anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that 
can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest drug company, will be playing  
catch-up to Monsanto Co.'s Celebrex drug, which won U.S. approval 
on Dec. 31. Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, 
making it the biggest new drug of 1999. It has also has become the 
second-fastest-selling new drug in history after Pfizer Inc.'s 
impotence pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to  
treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans. 
But instead of also seeking indication for rheumatoid arthritis, 
which affects about 2 million Americans, it wants the FDA to 
approve Vioxx for acute pain treatment -- a market of more than 40 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing  
how the drug works against different types of pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking  
aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a 
dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks 
exist even with short duration use, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said  
getting the acute pain indication is vital for Merck, though the 
market for the both Celebrex and Vioxx is bigger with arthritis 
because patients with that condition take pain relievers more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory committee meets April 20 to review Merck's  
application for Vioxx.
