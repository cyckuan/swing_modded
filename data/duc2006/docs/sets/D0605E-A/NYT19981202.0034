HOPES FOR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS WITH NEW KINDS OF PAIN DRUGS  
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pain sufferers may be getting some new drug options that appear
to bring relief with fewer side effects than most other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One drug, called gabapentin, is already on the market as a
treatment for epileptic seizures. Two new studies, appearing
Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show
the drug is an effective painkiller in hard-to-treat cases of nerve
damage from diabetes or shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration endorsed the first in a potential new line of pain
relievers, known as Cox 2 inhibitor drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain
from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other
gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox 2 inhibitors are being widely touted as potential
blockbusters, likely to generate at least $1 billion a year in
sales during their first year on the market. Estimates for
worldwide sales of all analgesics run as high as $12 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts doubt the new drugs will live up to their early
billing as ``superaspirins.'' The evidence does suggest they cause
fewer side effects than ibuprofen and aspirin, even with daily use
for many years. But the Cox 2 inhibitors don't seem to control pain
much better than current treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA-sponsored advisory panel voted to recommend approval of
Celebrex, G.D. Searle &AMP; Co.'s Cox 2 inhibitor, for both
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The vote paves the way for
full FDA approval sometime next year. Meanwhile, Merck &AMP; Co. has
its own Cox 2 inhibitor awaiting approval, and other drugmakers are
said to be close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with pain from nerve damage will not need to wait to
try gabapentin _ it's now sold as an anti-convulsant under the
brand name Neurontin by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to
start prescribing it immediately for pain patients. Many already
have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have
had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that
it works.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies were carried out by independent teams of
clinical researchers across the country, including doctors at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably
better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and
post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also
help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important advance in pain management,'' said Dr.
Edgar Ross, director of the pain management center at Brigham and
Women's Medical Center in Boston, who participated in one of the
two studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have a drug reasonably
well-tolerated by most people and effective for a problem that has
been resistant to most treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said the company is evaluating the
new evidence, and may seek FDA permission to start promoting
Neurontin as a pain remedy. But no decision has been made, she
said.
