   Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis. Others
just ease the money out of your wallet. Here's what you need to
know to be a wise _ and safe _ consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Shark cartilage. Glucosamine. Chondroitin. You've undoubtedly
heard of them. They're all touted to help _ if not ``cure'' _
arthritis. But do they work? Some do, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend an estimated $10 billion a year on unproven _
and ineffective _ arthritis remedies. This guide will help you
choose the right natural remedy to ease your pain _ and at the
right price too. Here is an overview of supplements, what they
claim to do, any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.
 &UR; GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building
blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine
soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day in two or three
doses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 600-mg capsules, $7.99.
Nature's Bounty: Thirty 500-mg capsules, $10.89
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHONDROITIN SULFATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in
cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from
harmful chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint
degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain. But evidence
is stronger for glucosamine.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 1,200 mg a day in two or three doses. (May
increase the effects of blood-thinning drugs and herbs.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Thirty 750-mg capsules, $17.09.
Basic Nutrition: Thirty 400-mg capsules, $9.99. GNC: Thirty 400-mg
capsules, $18.49.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: The combined effects of these supplements may help ease
osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: A recent study showed that after eight weeks of taking
both supplements (Cosamin), men with OA reported less knee pain.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin
in three doses. It may take up to eight weeks to see improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Cosamin DS: 180 capsules, $84.99 to
$94.99.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAM-e/ or S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: May improve joint mobility and relieve the pain of OA by
boosting levels of the amino acid ATP and supporting cartilage
production.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some studies have shown that SAM-e relieves mild OA pain
almost as well as NSAIDs, but without the digestive tract side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 200 to 400 mg in three doses.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 200-mg tablets, $39.99. Nature
Made: Twenty 200-mg tablets, $21.99.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FISH OIL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil _ eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) _ may ease rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) symptoms by providing anti-inflammatory building
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Many studies have shown that fish oil helps the
inflammation and accompanying pain of RA. It may reduce the need
for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 3 grams (g) or 3,000 mg a day total of EPA/DHA.
Good food sources are cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon,
tuna and mackerel. Try to eat them two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Nature's Way: Max EPA, 100 capsules (120
mg DHA and 180 mg EPA each), $10.39. Twinlab: Twin EPA Extra
Strength, 60 capsules (240 mg DHA and 600 mg EPA each), $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLA (GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: The body converts these omega-6 fatty acids into
anti-inflammatory compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Studies show that GLA can reduce the tenderness, morning
stiffness and inflammation of RA. It may reduce the need for NSAIDs
such as ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 1,800 mg a day. GLA is available in evening
primrose oil (may counteract the effects of anticonvulsant drugs),
borage oil and black currant seed oil.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Ultra GLA 300, Thirty 300-mg
softgels, $11.89.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREEN TEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Polyphenols in green tea have been shown to reduce
inflammation, a symptom of RA.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Mice given green tea extract had much lower rates of
arthritis than mice not given the extract. Human studies are
needed, but green tea is safe, so it may be worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 3 to 4 cups a day (equivalent of 600 to 800 mg
of polyphenols). It's also available in decaffeinated and flavored
forms and capsules. If you buy decaffeinated tea, it must be
decaffeinated using water and carbon dioxide, a process called
effervescence, in order to retain the polyphenols. If the label
doesn't tell you, contact the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: GNC: Star GLA Omega-3 Gamma-Linolenic
Acid, Sixty 200-mg softgel capsules, $29.99. Alvita: Green Tea bulk
(note: milk may interfere with the polyphenol's action, so drink
green tea plain), 4.5 ounces, $3.99. GNC: Chinese Harvest of Nature
Green Tea, 24 bags, $4.99. Natrol: Sixty 500-mg capsules, $8.29
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TYPE II COLLAGEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Suppresses the autoimmune response that causes the pain,
swelling, and stiffness of RA.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: Some studies show that taking type II collagen orally can
reduce the pain and inflammation of RA.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested Dose: 500 micrograms (mcg) or less. NSAIDs may block
the absorption of type II collagen; talk to your doctor before
using.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Maxilife chicken collagen, 60
pills, $25.95.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SAVE YOUR MONEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pain and chronic nature of arthritis force some people to
try almost anything for relief, even unproven _ or downright
harmful _ remedies. When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance. In
the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to
relieve arthritis _ though some have benefits for other conditions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Copper bracelets: There's no scientific evidence to back up
copper's antiarthritis claims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shark cartilage: Although advertised to help ease
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no
scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alfalfa: Used for years as a folk remedy for arthritis, no
studies show that it's effective.
</P>
<P>
   _ DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide): A byproduct of wood processing,
DMSO is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with
arthritis. But many versions on the market aren't suitable for
humans. They're chemically impure and potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe MSM? There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl
sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain. So far, no
published studies have shown that it's effective for treating
arthritis. But if you haven't had success with any of the proven
arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try MSM to see if it
helps you.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SHOP SMART &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to
know what to buy and what to avoid. Our 10-point checklist will
help.
</P>
<P>
   1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the
active ingredient it contains.
</P>
<P>
   2. Choose products from large companies _ they value their
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.
</P>
<P>
   4. Avoid products using words such as ``scientific
breakthrough'' or ``miracle cure.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   6. Remember: If a product sounds too good to be true, it
probably is.
</P>
<P>
   7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten
your doctor's OK to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   9. Bear in mind that ``natural'' doesn't necessarily mean safe.
</P>
<P>
   10. If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to
your doctor.
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Need another reason to get your five-a-day? Some studies have
shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may
protect joints _ especially the knee _ from the ravages of
osteoarthritis (OA). Here are a few of the studies' findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a
reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Certain antioxidants (including lutein and lycopene, among
others) were associated with lower risk of knee OA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
</P>
<P>
   To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein,
lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes,
broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges,
kiwifruit and strawberries. (Prevention now recommends nine veggies
a day for disease protection.)
</P>
<P>
   To get the amount of vitamin E that most experts advise, you'll
need a vitamin E supplement containing 400 international units.
Since OA progression was three times higher in people with low
levels of vitamin D, it's best to take a multivitamin/mineral
supplement with 100 percent of the daily value for D.
