 &HT;    SCIENCE/MEDICINE: Education crucial in managing joint pain

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Even as new medications are relieving arthritis
symptoms without upsetting stomachs, an Arthritis Foundation survey
shows that misconceptions by both doctors and patients are holding
people back from treatment that might help.
</P>
<P>
   The American Physical Therapy Association hopes to educate at
least the patients this weekend when it operates a toll-free hot
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tips that physical therapists can offer to help
people with arthritis to avoid fatigue and flare-ups and to make
their homes more arthritis-friendly,'' said APTA president Jan K.
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment
strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation
found, despite research showing the value of support groups,
exercise classes and other complementary therapies. The
foundation's own Arthritis Self-Help Course has been shown to
reduce pain by 20 percent and doctor visits by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is the No. 1 cause of disability in this country, the
foundation claims, costing the economy $65 billion a year and
striking 40 million Americans, including 300,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's report card still found considerable belief
in the myths that arthritis only affects the elderly and that
little can be done to relieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of five Americans with chronic joint symptoms haven't
sought a doctor's diagnosis, according to research by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. And even among those diagnosed
with arthritis, nearly three out of five are not undergoing
treatment for it.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is many people's stomachs can't handle the longtime
drug of choice for arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
</P>
<P>
   But two recently approved drugs called cox-2 inhibitors have
shown success in relieving arthritis pain without upsetting the
stomach. Celecoxib, marketed as Celebrex, was the first on the
market, with MK-0966 (Vioxx) receiving approval May 21. Two new
injectable drugs, hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk),
also are effective for osteoarthritis of the knee.
</P>
<P>
   By inhibiting only cox-2 enzymes, the new drugs relieve pain in
the joints without leaving the stomach lining vulnerable to ulcers
and bleeding, explains the Mayo Clinic's Mayo Health Oasis Web site
(www.mayohealth.org).
</P>
<P>
   The nutritional supplement glocusamine sulfate has been
associated with reduced pain and increased mobility for arthritis
patients, Mayo says, but it also warns that it hasn't been
subjected to long-term safety studies and that dietary supplements
aren't federally regulated to contain what they say they do. Little
controlled research has been done on chondroitin sulfate, another
popular arthritis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent arthritis products are at the top of the list of top
health frauds published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper bracelets, Chinese herbal remedies, large doses of
vitamins, snake or bee venom just don't work,'' the FDA explains.
``Because the symptoms of arthritis go into remission periodically,
individuals who try these unproven remedies may associate the
remedy with the remission.''
