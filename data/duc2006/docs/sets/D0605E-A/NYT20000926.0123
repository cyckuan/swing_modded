<P>
   This isn't the way medical science is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   A remedy used to treat creaky bones in horses and dogs works so
well that humans start taking it. It gets hyped in a best-selling
book on arthritis and the number of users skyrockets. Doctors get
glowing testimonials from patients, so they tell other patients to
try it. Finally, with about 5 million Americans taking the
concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage, enough begin asking
how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _
that scientists finally begin studying its safety and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin, which
taken together or separately are now America's top-selling joint
supplements. The early results of research, including one study
just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment
actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further
cartilage damage.
</P>
<P>
   The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce
potions, which are available over the counter, even more wildly
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strange, inverted application of the traditional
scientific model,'' said Dr. Timothy McAlindon, an associate
professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the
evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science isn't black or white. We're building a case trying
to figure out if this works or not, and at the moment the evidence
is favoring these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roland Moskowitz, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University who next week will help initiate the biggest study ever
of glucosamine and chondroitin for the National Institutes of
Health, also is bemused by the treatment's unconventional history.
But he said ``enough people are using it that if it works, we ought
to know about it. And if it doesn't, we should know it doesn't and
stop people from spending money on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, we'll have lucked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck has little to do with it if you ask the hordes of horsemen
and pet owners across America who have been giving their animals
the glucosamine-chondroitin pill since the early 1990s and swear
that it quickens the animals' gait and eases their agony. Ditto for
millions of people in Europe who for even longer have been using
the two compounds, which occur naturally in human cartilage and are
synthesized in the treatment capsules. The Europeans even have
scientific studies, more than three dozen of them, saying the
medicine works.
</P>
<P>
   American researchers have been slower to show an interest, which
is largely a function of the way things work here with herbal
therapies, dietary supplements and other nonpharmaceutical
products. Given the medicine's natural derivation, drug companies
find it difficult to take out patents on the products, so they have
no incentive to sponsor the expensive research to ensure they are
effective or safe. The Food and Drug Administration also steers
clear of such remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, however, American researchers have
become curious. It was partly because of the publication in 1997 of
a popular book called ``The Arthritis Cure,'' and the way it
triggered an avalanche of interest in glucosamine-chondroitin among
America's 20 million sufferers of the degenerative joint disease
called osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Many were frustrated with the side effects of other medicines
and were thrilled with results they got with the new treatment.
Doctors were not about to object since their patients were so
convinced and the treatment seemed safe, although over time they
started pressing for more concrete evidence.
</P>
<P>
   McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether
all the European studies held up. His conclusion, outlined in an
article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, was that the overseas clinical trials do show that
glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers
and are safe. But nearly all the European trials were supported by
manufacturers of the supplements who had the most to gain from
positive publicity. And ``in general they were not that well
done,'' McAlindon said last week. ``They seem to exaggerate the
treatments' efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of US studies is trying to weed out those quality
problems and come up with definitive answers. The largest of its
kind, published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and
Cartilage, looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and
movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees. ``The treatment was
significantly more effective than a placebo for pain and
function,'' said Dr. Amal Das, a joint replacement surgeon in
Hendersonville, N.C., and the lead author.
</P>
<P>
   That finding is consistent with reports from private physicians
nationwide and with the results of other, smaller studies,
including one published last year involving 34 Navy personnel
suffering from knee or lower back pain. While the effects on back
pain were unclear, that study found, the aching in knees clearly
was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   The next question everyone is asking is whether the treatment
does more than mask the pain. Does it actually cure the underlying
disease of osteoarthritis? And can it help the thousands of young
athletes with cartilage damage?
</P>
<P>
   Logic suggests it might. Glucosamine in its natural form
stimulates cells that make cartilage, while chondroitin sulfate
blocks enzymes that break down old cartilage. The question is
whether the same effects are produced by the capsules people take,
which generally get glucosamine from crab, lobster, or clam shells
and chondroitin from the cartilage in a cow's trachea. And, even
trickier, can the glucosamine and chondroitin in the pill work
their way from the stomach to the blood to the aching knee?
</P>
<P>
   Animal tests in Arizona offer hope. Cartilage was removed from
rabbits to mimic an injury of the kind humans get, and they were
fed glucosamine, chondroitin, and a combination of the two. After
several months, researchers examined the injured area. ``We found
the severity of the arthritis process was less in those given the
treatment,'' and the combination of compounds worked best, said Dr.
Robert R. Karpman, one of the researchers who oversaw the study in
Phoenix, which is due to be published next month. ``It seems to
slow the arthritic process, but it doesn't repair the joint
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Arizona study raises questions. For instance: could
humans tolerate the megadoses given to rabbits? Were the beneficial
effects a result of stopping further erosion of the cartilage or
making new proteins to replace what was gone? And can glucosamine
and chondroitin really find their way around the stomach and liver
not just to a knee or other joint, but to the particular joint that
is damaged?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that cartilage does not have blood vessels, and gets
its only nutrition by seepage through the surrounding membrane,
probably makes it easier for substances like glucosamine and
chondroitin to work their way there, said Dr. Lou Lippiello,
director of laboratory research at Nutramax Laboratories, one of
the leading manufacturers of the treatment and a partial sponsor of
the Hendersonville and Phoenix studies. ``Apparently it doesn't
affect normal joints,'' he added. ``It seems to have an affinity
for joints that are undergoing some kind of trauma or stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Further studies clearly are needed, which is why the NIH next
week is scheduled to begin a $10 million project involving 1,500
patients. It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two
together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and
whether they actually attack the underlying disease.
</P>
<P>
   What should patients do in the meantime?
</P>
<P>
   Most orthopedic surgeons advise their patients to try it, under
a doctor's guidance. But it is expensive _ $1 or so a day for the
eight weeks it takes to begin working, at which point the dosage is
lowered and the cost falls to about 60 cents a day. Insurance
generally does not cover the treatment, and physicians caution
children and pregnant women not to use it. Anyone who has diabetes
or is taking the blood-thinning drug heparin also should be
careful. And researchers warn that many of the low-cost concoctions
being marketed today do not contain quality products.
