<HEADLINE> Merck Hopes New Pill Will Ease Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Merck &AMP; Co. made a $5.2 billion profit last year  
on nearly $27 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future of the nation's largest drugmaker is uncertain as  
four of its blockbuster drugs lose patent protection in the next 
two years, which make them susceptible to competition from cheaper 
generics. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why analysts say Merck desperately needs strong sales  
from its new pain pill Vioxx, which was approved Friday by the Food 
and Drug Administration and is expected to reach pharmacies in 
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx, though, will have to compete with another new painkiller,  
Celebrex, which has been the hottest selling drug of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have written 4.4 million prescriptions for Celebrex,  
jointly marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, since it was launched in 
early January. Celebrex this spring became the second fastest 
selling new drug ever, after the anti-impotence pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2  
inhibitors. They offer the same pain relief as traditional 
arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and 
intestinal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side  
effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard 
warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved  
Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex is also approved for osteoarthritis, which is the wear  
and tear of joints usually linked with aging, as well as for 
rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body's immune system backfires 
to cause pain and inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can  
prescribe it for other ailments. As a result, analysts say it is 
likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle between the drugs will take place in physician  
offices as thousands of pharmaceutical sales representatives prod 
doctors to give out free samples. Heavy consumer advertising should 
also start later this year. Both drugs also will battle to gain 
acceptance from managed care companies, which increasingly restrict 
pharmaceutical coverage. Celebrex is covered by about half of all 
health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion  
in annual sales by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the  
hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose 
U.S. patent protection next year. Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor 
and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth  
has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials play down their reliance on Vioxx. ``We have a  
lot of products,'' said Wendy Dixon, Merck's vice president of 
marketing. ``Vioxx is clearly important to us, but we are by no 
means dependent on the success of Vioxx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts see it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Merck is ``extremely dependent'' on Vioxx's success, said Neil  
Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing  
results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data 
for Celebrex. Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 
4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious 
gastrointestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Merck will be able to do some damage with those  
numbers,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of the drugs will only become clear in the months  
ahead as the drugs are used by hundreds of thousands of patients 
compared to the few thousand patients which took part in the drugs' 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials also hope to convince doctors and patients that  
Vioxx is a true once a day pill. They note that a significant 
number of Celebrex users must take the pill twice a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The average wholesale price for Vioxx and Celebrex is $2.02 for  
the standard dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper  
arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.
