	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Drug makers, eyeing Viagra's runaway success
with profit envy, expect the drive for arthritis relief will yield
the next wonder drug.
	   Some industry experts believe Celebra, a painkiller that cuts
inflammation but avoids the stomach-damaging effects of aspirin,
ibuprofen and acetaminophen, could outsell the impotency drug by
millions of dollars a year.
	   Drug makers' ceaseless efforts to stock America's medicine chest
have long plowed research money into trying to ease such ills as
cancer, obesity and chronic pain. But the road to a cancer cure is
littered with promising treatments that fizzled. And last year's
recall of two diet pills left many dieters wary of weight-loss
drugs.
	   Now comes a new class of super painkillers with a singular
advantage: They could be on pharmacy shelves within months. And
industry watchers believe millions of Americans will gladly toss
their bottles of common painkillers for an alternative that saves
their stomachs.
	   Kathryn Howe already has.
	   Rheumatoid arthritis left the 51-year-old executive secretary's
joints so swollen she couldn't type or take long walks. Rolling
over in bed hurt.
	   She kept the swelling under control with prescription-strength
versions of drugs such as Tylenol and Advil. But 15 years of them
left her with an inflamed stomach and rectal bleeding. Last year,
her doctor asked her to test an unapproved drug called Celebra. Now
she walks, swims, does low-impact aerobics and even lifts weights
comfortably with no apparent side effects.
	   ``A person can shake my hand and I'm not in pain,'' the
Eastlake, Ohio, resident said. ``I can hold a pencil.''
	   Some analysts predict Celebra will outsell Viagra, the lucrative
Pfizer Inc. impotency treatment that became the fastest-selling
drug in history its first month.
	   ``That's what I would put my finger on as the next blockbuster
drug, not only in terms of medicinal value but in terms of cult
following,'' said Stephen Tang, a drug industry specialist with
A.T. Kearney, a management consulting firm in New York.
	   Typical estimates call for annual Viagra sales to reach dlrs 3
billion by 2002. Celebra sales could eventually top dlrs 4 billion,
said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Christina Heuer.
	   With the global market for prescription painkillers, not
including over-the-counter sales, at dlrs 5 billion, Ms. Heuer
predicts Celebra could be ``the most significant new drug
introduction of 1999.''
	   Celebra is expected to be the first out of the blocks from a new
class of drugs called cox-2 inhibitors, so named because they block
the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase. Aspirin and similar
anti-inflammatory drugs do that too, but they go too far, also
blocking the cox-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining.
	   Doctors believe the new class of painkillers may also provide a
significant side benefit. Patients are more likely to get better
faster, or improve more profoundly, if they're willing to take
their medicine and stay on it.
	   When Mrs. Howe was prescribed standard anti-inflammatory drugs
that hurt her stomach, she conceded, ``I wasn't a very compliant
patient.''
	   Celebra's manufacturer, Monsanto Corp.'s Searle unit, is
expected to ask the Food and Drug Administration for an expedited
six-month review by September. If that happens, the drug could be
on the market by early next year in the United States and late 1999
abroad.
	   Having tested Celebra's effects on rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis and dental pain, scientists are now researching
signs that Celebra might help prevent colon cancer and Alzheimer's
disease, in which cox-2 is believed to play a role.
	   If it is approved for rheumatoid arthritis, the most severe
joint disease, doctors would be free to prescribe it for a number
of painful conditions.
	   Searle will have to move quickly. Merck and Co. is about six
months behind in developing a rival painkiller named Vioxx. Glaxo
Wellcome PLC, Johnson and Johnson and Roche Laboratories also have
cox-2 drugs on the way. Already Merck and Searle are entangled in a
legal battle over patents.
	   Monsanto, Searle's parent, has agreed to be acquired by American
Home Products Corp., but the new owner won't be marketing Celebra.
Searle signed up Pfizer for that agreeable task long before the
acquisition.
	   Whoever handles it, Wall Street appears to be betting on
Celebra.
	   ``Cox-2, that's potentially the next big blockbuster, and I
think Monsanto and Pfizer have the upper hand,'' said Hemant K.
Shah, an independent drug industry analyst in Warren, New Jersey.
``The first product always has the advantage.''
	   Prozac's dlrs 2.6 billion in worldwide sales, for instance,
makes it the best-selling antidepressant years after similar rivals
_ Pfizer's Zoloft, Glaxo's Wellbutrin, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil _
came on the market.
	   In addition to the cox-2 class, Wall Street analysts recognize
several candidates as wild-card contenders in the race for the next
wonder drug:
	   _ Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan. Ms. Heuer estimates the drug could
bring in dlrs 1.5 billion in 2002, matching 1997 sales of
SmithKline's top-selling antibiotic Augmentin.
	   _ Avandia, an oral diabetes drug by SmithKline. Analysts say it
could become a blockbuster if it lacks the side effects of
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin, which was pulled from the market in the
United Kingdom after a few patients suffered liver failure.
	   _Leptin, Amgen Inc.'s weight-loss hormone. Some patients lost 35
pounds in six months, but doctors remain wary of obesity drugs
since last August's recall of the diet pills Redux and fen-phen, a
combination of fenfluramine and phentermine. Knoll Pharmaceuticals'
new diet pill, Meridia, drew a lackluster 11,185 prescriptions last
month, according to researcher IMS Health. Leptin is also being
tested on diabetes patients.
	   But even blockbusters will have a hard time topping Viagra, with
an unprecedented 1.7 million prescriptions in three months.
	   ``There's never been a drug like this so far in the history of
the business,'' said Joseph P. Riccardo, a drug industry analyst at
Bear Stearns and Co. in New York.
