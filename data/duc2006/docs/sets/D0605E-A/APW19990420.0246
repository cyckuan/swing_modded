<HEADLINE> Paper: Celebrex Linked to 10 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto's highly successful painkiller Celebrex  
has been linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal 
hemorrhages in its first three months on the market, The Wall 
Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 10 people who died suffered from gastrointestinal  
bleeding or ulcers, according to ``adverse incident'' reports 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that were obtained by 
the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other deaths were attributed to heart attacks, one to drug  
interaction and one to kidney disorder. No cause of death was given 
for the 10th fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	A Monsanto spokeswoman said Tuesday that there is no evidence  
that Celebrex actually caused the deaths or other health problems 
in people taking the drug. More than 2 million consumers have taken 
Celebrex. ``You can't draw any conclusions from the adverse 
incident reports,'' said spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal did not specify the sources of the adverse event  
reports, which could come from health professionals, consumers or 
the drug company itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, manufactured by St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D.  
Searle &AMP; Co. subsidiary, went on the market in January to treat 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex was touted by Monsanto as an effective pain reliever  
much like ibuprofen, but was much less likely to cause severe 
stomach problems such as bleeding ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far it has been a gigantic success: 2.5 million prescriptions  
have been filled in its first 13 weeks on the market, compared with 
the record 2.7 million prescriptions of anti-impotency drug Viagra 
filled during its first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert DeLap, director of an FDA office of drug evaluation, told  
the Journal that more research needs to be done before coming to a 
conclusion about Celebrex's safety. ``Do we think there's a signal 
that the product poses some special risk? No, not at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searle officials told the Journal they remain excited about  
Celebrex's performance. ``We really feel the drug is performing as 
expected. The safety profile is what we would expect,'' said Steve 
Geis, the company's vice president for arthritis clinical research. 
</P>
<P>
	Geis declined to go into details about any cases of death linked  
to the drug, but said that many patients taking Celebrex have other 
illnesses and are taking multiple medications.
