	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The pharmaceutical industry is announcing big
gains in the fight against arthritis this week, with several
companies reporting they can now reduce pain and slow progression
of the often debilitating illness.
	   The federal government has approved two new drugs to treat
rheumatoid arthritis since September, drugs that aim to help those
with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease.
	   But industry observers say the biggest advances will occur next
year with the expected approval of arthritis drugs made by Searle
Inc. and Merck and Co. These drugs will treat the pain and
inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems
associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs,
the companies say.
	   These drugs, called Cox-2 inhibitors, are likely to be marketed
to people with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis _ or nearly
40 million Americans.
	   The arthritis drugs, those in testing and those on the market,
are being showcased this week at the American College of
Rheumatology meeting in San Diego, where each company is trying to
show arthritis doctors why its treatment works best.
	   ``This is a tremendous time,'' said Dr. Brian Butcher, an
official with the Arthritis Foundation. ``We have gone from where
we could not offer much hope to people to where we can diagnose,
provide early treatment and stop the progression of the disease.''
	   Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts 2.1 million Americans. It occurs
when patients' immune systems go awry and attack their joints,
causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away
cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects more than 37 million Americans,
and is usually associated with the aging process.
	   In the past year, doctors wrote 76.7 million prescriptions for
anti-arthritis drugs, according to IMS Health, a research group.
With a number of new drugs coming on the market, analysts expect
sales to increase from dlrs 1.9 billion to dlrs 3 billion by 2001.
	   Among its many players, the pain wars pit Merck, the largest
drug company worldwide in terms of sale, against the fastest
growing company, Pfizer. Pfizer will market Celebra, the Cox-2
inhibitor made by Searle, a division of Monsanto. The federal Food
and Drug Administration's advisory committee has scheduled a
hearing on Celebra for Dec. 1.
	   Merck hopes to file for FDA approval for its Vioxx drug later
this year. Company officials say they are not concerned about
lagging behind Celebra for federal approval. One reason is because
Vioxx is designed as a once-a-day pill, while Celebra will have to
be taken several times daily.
	   Dr. Bennett Shapiro, an executive vice president with Merck,
attributed the surge of interest in arthritis to scientific
discoveries in 1991 that showed that two different enzymes cause
the body to make hormones that bring pain and inflammation and also
protect the stomach lining. As a result, drugs could be developed
that stopped the pain, but left the stomach alone.
	   Immunex Corp., which won federal approval last week for its
Enbrel arthritis drug, is working with American Home Products Corp.
to market it. Enbrel is given via injection twice a week and
studies show it reduces pain and duration of morning stiffness and
improves swollen and tender joints. Enbrel used the meeting in San
Diego to show that the drug is also effective in children.
	   Centocor Inc. used the meeting to show its experimental drug
Remicade also provides relief from rheumatoid arthritis. Remicade
is already approved to treat Crohn's disease, an intestinal
disorder. The company hopes to win approval to treat arthritis with
the drug next year.
	   Enbrel and Remicade will compete with Arava, the arthritis drug
approved by the FDA in September. Arava, made by Hoechst Marion
Roussell, bills itself as the only approved drug that helps stop
the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.
