<P>
   Dr. Bobby Wroten, the prestigious Fort Worth hand surgeon who
fixed Juan Gonzalez's left thumb last year, was peering at my
X-rays. We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep
your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength,
but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
</P>
<P>
   I had arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from
successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much
more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and
shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise,
arthritis can wake you up at night _ sometimes with tender spots
that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
</P>
<P>
   Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your
joints.
</P>
<P>
   I take a lot of Tylenol and Aleve and have tried cortisone
injections and capsaicin cream, the topical analgesic made from red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee
stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some
arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for
the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of
arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we
do on research,'' says Dr. Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at
the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is prone to unproven, fraudulent and even dangerous
treatments because so many people suffer from it _ 40 million
Americans today, expected to hit 59.4 million by 2020 _ and because
there are no effective drugs that work long term for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``People grasp at straws. Sometimes patients feel doctors don't
give their arthritis enough attention. There must be something
better out there, so they go looking for it,'' Rubin says.
</P>
<P>
   Something better _ in the form of a whole new class of
anti-inflammatory drugs that fight pain and joint destruction
without destroying the stomach and kidneys _ made headlines this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 inhibitors, being developed under the names Celebra and
Vioxx, are expected to outsell even Viagra, the impotency pill that
became the fastest-selling drug in history.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 drugs are not more effective, just safer. They are easier
on the stomach and can be taken in larger doses for a longer time
without damage to the stomach or kidneys. They could be on pharmacy
shelves by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of
arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat
people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the
side effects,'' says Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such
as Naproxen and Ibuprofen. Anti-inflammatories are drugs that
reduce both pain and swelling by neutralizing the enzymes that
cause them. Researchers have identified two types of this enzyme:
cox-1, which releases chemicals that protect the stomach against
peptic ulcers, and cox-2, which releases chemicals that cause
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   The old class of drugs inhibited both enzymes. The new class of
drugs selectively works against cox-2 enzymes _ without inhibiting
the cox-1 enzymes that protect the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a development that could be worth billions. Arthritis
sufferers spend millions to pay for unproven alternatives because
it gives them a sense of mastery over their pain and because they
mistakenly believe that traditional medicine has nothing to offer,
says Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs for
the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, the public's misconception that tends to lump
all forms of arthritis into one package, and to assume that it's an
inevitable part of aging and nothing can be done about it _ all
misconceptions,'' Conn says.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``arthritis'' includes more than 100 disorders that
attack cartilage in the bone joints. The disease causes pain,
swelling and loss of movement when bone rubs against bone after the
cartilage has deteriorated. The best treatment depends on the
specific diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common types of arthritis:
</P>
<P>
   OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease. Affects an
estimated 15.8 million Americans, mostly over age 45. It involves
the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear
injuries, and is most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing
joints including the knees, feet, hips and back.
</P>
<P>
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. One of the most serious and disabling
types, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Americans. It involves a
genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes
inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage
and bone. It often leads to crippling deformities in the hands,
wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE ARTHRITIS. A general term for all types of arthritis
that occur in children. An estimated 300,000 children in this
country have the disease; most have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   FIBROMYALGIA. Affects approximately 3.7 million Americans,
causing pain and tenderness at points where muscles attach to
bones. People with fibromyalgia frequently experience fatigue,
disturbed sleep, stiffness and sometimes psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   GOUT. A painful condition that most often attacks small joints,
especially in the big toe. It is caused by a defect in body
chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes
in diet.
</P>
<P>
   BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS. Result from irritation caused by
injuring or overusing a joint. Bursitis affects a small sac that
helps muscles move easily. Tendinitis affects the tendons that
attach muscles to bone.
</P>
<P>
   It is critically important to first find out what kind of
arthritis you have, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually there are lifestyle measures that are very
important,'' Conn says. ``If you have osteoarthritis of the knee
and you are 20 pounds overweight, that weight is a big factor. You
need to know what exercising, what conditioning you should be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier that diagnosis is made, the more hope there is for
living well into old age with even the most crippling forms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended
very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with
disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for
cancer treatment).
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health reported last month that
arthritis is now the leading cause of disability among Americans
older than 15, as measured by federal disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of aging baby boomers and the growing number of
children who have the disease put arthritis ahead of heart disease,
the leading cause of disability payments in a similar study in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   More than $65 billion a year in Social Security disability
payments goes to the 21 million arthritis sufferers who are unable
to work because of their disease, according to the Arthritis
Foundation. In comparison, about $50 billion a year in disability
payments goes to 17 million heart disease patients.
