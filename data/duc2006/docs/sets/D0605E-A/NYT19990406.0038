 NEWEST DRUGS RELIEVE PAIN WITH LESS RISK  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  New insights into the biochemistry of pain are starting to pay
off in safer, and perhaps even more effective, treatment options
for chronic sufferers.
<P>
   One new type of painkiller, known as COX-2 inhibitors, just hit
pharmacy shelves. The drugs appear to be no more effective at
fighting pain than traditional anti-inflammatory medications such
as ibuprofen and aspirin, but offer the advantage of fewer side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   That is a major plus for people who must use pain relievers
long-term and risk such problems as stomach bleeding and ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the new drugs, Celebrex, developed by Monsanto's
G.D. Searle &AMP; Co. pharmaceutical unit and co-marketed by Pfizer
Inc., was launched commercially last month.
</P>
<P>
   A different drug of the same type, Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, is
awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be
on the market by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters,
likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   COX-2 drugs are designed primarily for those with rheumatoid
arthritis, which afflicts about 2.1 million people in the United
States, and for painful flareups of osteoarthritis, the
``wear-and-tear'' form of the ailment, which affects an estimated
20.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied
mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold
over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such
as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with
constant use. A 1997 study of arthritis patients showed at least
107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths a year from
NSAID-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   COX-2 drugs block production of an enzyme called
cyclooxygenase-2, which produces painful inflammation. Unlike
NSAIDs, however, they do not interfere with the closely related
COX-1 enzyme, which helps build a protective lining in the stomach
and gastrointestinal tract.
</P>
<P>
   Searle began selling Celebrex for $2.42 per 200 milligram pill,
less than expected but still more than some HMOs might be willing
to pay, especially for patients without a demonstrated problem with
NSAIDs.
</P>
<P>
   The COX-2 inhibitors, meanwhile, are not the only new
possibilities for fighting pain:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ziconotide, awaiting FDA approval, has been touted as a
potent alternative to morphine in cases of severe pain. Derived
from sea snail venom, it is designed to block calcium channels in
nerve cells of the spine, interrupting the flow of pain signals to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   -- Enbrel, first in a new class of rheumatoid arthritis
medicines called biologic response modifiers, soaks up excess
``tumor necrosis factor,'' a chemical secreted by immune cells
involved in joint inflammations.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle, was approved by the
FDA last year1998cq &LR;  for use in adults. New studies show that it
may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   -- Neurontin, known generically as gabapentin, is an established
epilepsy drug that has been shown to work against hard-to-treat
nerve pain from shingles or diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tests are underway to establish whether memantine _ used in
Germany to treat Parkinson's disease _ can ease the pain of
diabetic neuropathy. The drug blocks NMDA receptors, nerve cell
sites that help relay pain signals.
