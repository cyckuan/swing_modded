COURT RULES AGAINST CUBAN BOY'S RELATIVES IN US

<P>
   The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be
their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba. It now
appears he could go home as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta unanimously
rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a
three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago. The panel had upheld
the US Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to allow an
asylum hearing for Elian, saying only the child's father could make
such a request.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to
the US Supreme Court. But the justices in Washington are widely
seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so,
both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and
because the three-judge panel cited a Supreme Court ruling as the
rationale for its own decision.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the only surprise about Friday's seemingly
conclusive announcement from Atlanta was that it had taken so long
to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's
absolutely the right decision,'' said Karen Jacobsen, a specialist
in refugee and immigration policy at the Fletcher School of
International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy. .
.and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families:
that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 judges of the 11th Circuit evidently shared with many
observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the
last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked
international controversy since Elian was discovered floating on an
inner tube off the Florida coast last November. He had survived,
with two others, a disastrous boat trip from Cuba in which his
mother and 10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that an injunction preventing Elian's father from
leaving the United States with his son expires at 4 p.m. Wednesday,
the five-page ruling said the appeals court will not entertain any
more requests for a stay. The word ``not'' appeared in oversized
and boldfaced type.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Friday's development was muted, especially compared
to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal
defeats for Elian's relatives have prompted. The Cuban-American
community in southern Florida appeared quiet, and there was no hint
of gloating from anyone on the winning side
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has
acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said in Washington. ``Now that the court has
conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and
son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Craig, the attorney for Elian's father, released a short
statement that relayed the same sentiments. It said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the INS decision to recognize the right of
Juan Miguel Gonzalez to speak for his son Elian is consistent with
the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions. We are
gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to
affirm those values and those traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig added that the elder Miguel and his family, who have been
living in suburban Washington awaiting a final disposition of the
case, ``look forward to resuming a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in his father's custody since April 22, when
federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great
uncle and cousins in the Little Havana section of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their
effort to prevent his return to Cuba, had argued that all 12 judges
on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge
panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the full court adamantly disagreed. Seven of the dozen
judges had to approve reconsideration in order for it to occur, but
none even asked for a vote on the question.
