   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an
international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of
thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday
night to demand his return from Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally matched the
emotional content of angry demonstrations by Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely
oppose a U.S. government decision to return Elian to his father's home here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from
crying. Telling the crowd of ``hard and difficult days'' suffered since the
child was rescued at sea, Gonzalez said that ``our tears have given way to
patriotic pride'' seeing tens of thousands turn out regularly demand Elian's
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
fishermen found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the
boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give
Elian a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has demanded that his child be returned to him, and the U.S.
government has ruled that the father and child should be reunited by next
Friday, Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas was the most personal and emotional of many held since
early December when President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the
boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him since
he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly,
two kites sailed high over the rally -- one of them flown by a boy named Julio.
</P>
<P>
	   It was imprinted with Elian's portrait and read, ``Julio claims you,
Eliancito.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, encouraged the crowd
to keep protesting until is back with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot call a truce yet,'' Alarcon said, warning that exiles in Miami
were trying to delay the child's return. ``We cannot let down our guard until
the kidnapping of Elian comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also called to an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that he
blamed for the custody flap. Under the law, any Cuban who reaches American soil
has the right to stay and seek permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case of Elian Gonzalez is the most repugnant expression of this law,''
said Alarcon, Fidel Castro's top man on American policy issues. ``It is the most
vulgar, the most cruel manipulation of a child ... really child abuse.'
