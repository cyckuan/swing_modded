   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday
to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to
take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as
early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it
would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an
action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department
to put its plan into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking
control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had
failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that
they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost
their court fight.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking
an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in
Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the
regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to
resolve the situation. But Justice Department officials warned that
they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives
that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts
to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly
that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian
in the United States. But they have declined to be more specific
and to comply with the Justice Department's demand.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an
interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family
will obey the law.'' But asked if that means that the family agrees
to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them,
Coffey said that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are
far from that moment.'' He said that he thought the general
statement that the family would comply with the law was ``more than
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers disagree, regarding the careful
statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, David J. Kline, a lawyer in the Justice Department's
immigration office, said that the government had the authority to
terminate permission for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales to
have temporary custody of the boy. But Kline said the agency would
agree to that only if the relatives said clearly they would send
Elian back three days after they lost in the appeals court unless
they obtained an injunction from a court allowing them to file an
expedited appeal with the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kline also demanded that Elian's family in Miami agree to an
expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would
have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4. But the
appeals court Monday may have made the department's case more
difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have grown increasingly impatient
with the tactics of the family. Some officials said that they might
well move to take control of Elian and send him back to Cuba while
the appeals are not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been more than generous,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian
in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami's
large Cuban-American community have rallied to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the
boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to
come to the United States capsized. Elian's mother and most of the
other passengers drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United
States suffered a setback last week when a federal judge dismissed
a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the boy,
concluding that a long, bitter legal battle was not in Elian's best
interest.
