   MIAMI BEACH _ After a day of false starts and confusion,
Attorney General Janet Reno jetted to Miami late Wednesday and met
with the Florida relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez in a last-ditch bid to break the long-running stalemate
over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' said
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin. ``She realizes it's a
tall order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Miami relatives, who have complained
repeatedly that top federal officials have never listened to their
side of the controversy, called Reno's visit a ``good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in the
Washington, D.C. area, where he has been staying at the home of a
Cuban diplomat since his arrival from Cuba last week. There were
unconfirmed reports that he might join in Reno's meeting with his
Miami relatives via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez told supporters Wednesday that he has grown
exasperated with the repeated delays in gaining custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I came here seven days ago, I came to get my boy, I
watch him on TV and they still haven't brought him to me,''' said
the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National Council
of Churches, who met with Gonzalez Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris
Meissner, Reno arrived in Miami about 6 p.m. (ET) on a mission to
resolve the standoff peacefully, hoping to avoid sending federal
marshals to retrieve the boy in the face of angry Cuban exile
protestors. Justice Department officials have prepared a letter
ordering the family to turn the boy over _ perhaps as early as
Thursday at an airport north of Miami _ in case the family fails to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place at the Miami Beach home of Barry
University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted a
dramatic reunion between Elian and his two Cuban grandmothers in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his Miami relatives moved to O'Laughlin's home at
mid-day Wednesday in an effort to escape the tension surrounding
the family's tiny Little Havana home. Boisterous crowds of Cuban
exiles have staged an around-the-clock vigil outside the home for
much of the past week, and have vowed to form a human chain to keep
the boy from being removed.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 protestors jeered as Reno's motorcade pulled up to
O'Laughlin's home at 6:40 p.m., with some holding signs depicting
Reno with devil's horns. Miami Beach police erected metal fencing
to keep the demonstrators on the far side of a divided road in
front of the home, and dozens of officers patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have been unwilling to turn the boy over
without assurances that he would not be quickly taken back to Cuba.
They have also demanded that Elian be allowed to go home with them
after any initial meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of events came after a failed attempt at a family
conference late Tuesday. About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful
Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami
relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a
meeting with the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, however, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzales,
backed out, saying that Elian feared his father and that the two
sides apparently misunderstood the terms for the meeting. Gonzalez
said he learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to
turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family
refused to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Although the quickening pace seemed to indicate the standoff
might soon be resolved, there was still a chance for further
delays. Without the family's cooperation, Reno was expected to send
the letter informing them when and where Elian should be turned
over.
</P>
<P>
   If the family failed to abide by the letter, Justice Department
officials said they would probably go to a federal court seeking an
order that they cooperate. It was unclear how long it might take to
obtain such an order.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives might also try a last-second court move,
perhaps asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
for an emergency injunction blocking the hand-over. The family's
appeal of their lawsuit in the case is pending in that court,
scheduled to be heard on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   It also remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would
remain in the United States once he is reunited with his son. He
has said he would be willing to stay pending the legal appeal if
the Miami family voluntarily turned over his son, and if an
entourage of Elian's teachers, classmates and others could join him
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   According to members of a team of mental health experts
appointed by Reno to help ease the boy's transition, Reno and INS
officials want both sides of the family to go to a secure, neutral
location for an extended reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS proposed that the families come together at a neutral
location without any outside people present and that they might
remain together for one or two weeks,'' Dr. Jerry Wiener told CNN.
Wiener and the other team members met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez
last weekend and briefly with Elian's Miami relatives on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian would see that some peace would be made, and the Miami
family would be able to continue to have a relationship with him,''
Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Miami family would cooperate remained to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Before Reno arrived, O'Laughlin made brief remarks to the press,
indicating that the family may be coming to grips with the
likelihood of losing their long battle to keep Elian in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled in facing what
perhaps could be pain,'' O'Laughlin said.
