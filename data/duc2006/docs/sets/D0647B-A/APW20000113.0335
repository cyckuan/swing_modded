<HEADLINE> Elian's Case Seen Helping Relatios  </HEADLINE>

	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- The custody flap over 6-year-old Elian Gonzales could
ultimately strengthen U.S.-Cuba relations if American officials stand firm and
do not succumb to political pressure, a former American diplomat to Havana said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The federal government is doing the right thing by standing by the INS
decision,'' said Wayne Smith, referring to the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not so sure that would have been the case several years ago,'' said
Smith, who was chief of the U.S. Interests Section for three years under
Presidents Reagan and Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno earlier Thursday urged those involved in the
dispute over the Cuban boy to resolve the situation quickly so the child ``can
get on with his life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has backed the INS determination that the boy be returned to his father
in Cuba, and has said that Florida state courts have no say in the federal
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that over the long term this case will actually help relations
between Washington and Havana,'' said Smith, because American officials have not
been swayed by Cuban exiles in Miami who want the child to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle over Elian, Smith said, is not between two governments but
between two ideological camps on differing sides of the Florida Straits: in
Miami and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on
Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 others died in an attempt to emigrate to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that the child be
returned to him in Cuba. But Elian's Miami relatives say they can give him a
better life off the communist island and are fighting to keep him in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful Miami-based exile group,
in 1996 won a libel suit against Smith after he accused the organization of
using taxpayer money for political campaigns. The verdict was reversed on appeal
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, in Havana with a Johns Hopkins University study group, said Cuban
exiles may be hurt most by the battle as more Americans side with the U.S.
government's decision to send the boy home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We could see a further loss of the exiles' political power,'' he said.
``The exiles already are in this alone as polls in the United States indicate a
great majority of Americans think he should be back with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, a delegation of American agricultural firms wrapped up a
four-day visit to Cuba, calling for a lifting of U.S. restrictions on food and
medicine sales here.
</P>
<P>
	   Among delegation members was former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture John
Block, who served under Reagan and is now president of the Food Distributors
International, an association of food wholesalers interested in working with
small private family cooperatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In years past as secretary of agriculture, I negotiated trade agreements
with the Soviet Union when it was with the Evil Empire,'' Block told reporters
during a tour of farms. ``Now we cannot even trade with a country 90 miles from
our shores.''
