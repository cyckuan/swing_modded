SUPREME COURT DECISION PERMITS ELIAN GONZALEZ TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<P>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to issue an order to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the
6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court order prohibiting the boy from leaving will
expire at 4 p.m. Wednesday, allowing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, to take his son home. A chartered plane was waiting at
Dulles International Airport in Washington to carry Elian and his
family and friends back to Cuba. Federal marshals will escort the
boy from a suburban Washington home to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse order released just after noon EDT, the Supreme Court
said that it would refuse to review the case. The high court also
refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy,
his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor
boat. Elian and two adults were saved after the boat capsized, but
the boy's mother, Elisabet, and 10 others died.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given
temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana
home. But Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him,
touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian quickly became the focus of demonstrations on both sides
of the Florida Straits. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up
demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who
quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the
country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son
could grow up in freedom. Others in Miami attached religious
significance to Elian's migration to Florida, saying that the
intercession of the Virgin Mary had saved the boy and that it would
be a violation of God's will to return the boy to a totalitarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Custody of the boy also became a political issue. Although a
majority of Americans supported returning the boy to his father,
Florida may be a key state in the fall presidential election and
the Cuban-American community is a potent voting bloc in Florida.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba,
denying a request by Lazaro Gonzalez that the boy be granted an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's great uncle filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the
decision of the Immigration Service. As the court fight dragged on,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled from Havana to Washington on April 6
with his new wife and their son to take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, however, balked at giving up the boy,
even after his father agreed that he would not leave the country
until the court case was resolved. When the Miami relatives ignored
an order from Attorney General Janet Reno to give up the boy, Reno
ordered a raid on the Miami home by armed federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has remained in the Washington area since he was taken
from Miami as the case made its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the denial of the amnesty hearing, but ordered the boy to
remain in the country as the relatives filed an appeal with the
full Court of Appeals. That appeal was also denied on June 23, and
the Miami relatives were given just five days to win an emergency
stay from the Supreme Court.
