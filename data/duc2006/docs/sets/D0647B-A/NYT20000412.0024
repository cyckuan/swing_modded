   WASHINGTON _ The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided
Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a
meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night. But
later, the boy's great-uncle said in Miami that the meeting was
off.
</P>
<P>
   In frantic last-minute negotiations, as the Justice Department
prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida,
representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Elian's father, agreed to a meeting in the Washington, D.C., area,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before midnight, Lazaro Gonzales, the great-uncle
who has custody of the boy, emerged from his house in Miami and
said Elian did not want to go to Washington, so no one from the
Miami family would go, The Associated Press reported. A crowd
gathered there erupted with cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said early Wednesday morning that efforts
were still under way to try to arrange the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had said that Elian would be accompanied by Lazaro
Gonzalez and Lazaro's 21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez.
Until Tuesday, the family had sought a meeting with the boy's
father, but had demanded that it occur in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, if it takes place as planned, would end the lengthy
custody battle with a peaceful transfer that Attorney General Janet
Reno had struggled to piece together. After the meeting was
announced, Justice Department officials expressed satisfaction that
the end seemed to be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Elian over to his father would settle the issue in the
view of immigration officials. Those officials said they would urge
Elian's father to remain in the United States until the courts
finally decide whether the boy should return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've encouraged them to talk and tried to facilitate from the
start,'' one official said. ``We're happy that this appears to be
an an opportunity for a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that the long dispute might be close to a
conclusion came late Tuesday night from Miami where a spokeswoman
for the Cuban American National Foundation said that
representatives of the Miami relatives would meet with Elian's
father on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., had helped
arrange the meeting. Efforts to reach Torricelli on Tuesday night
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The development came after a hectic day in which Reno had first
considered and then canceled plans to visit Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at
news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for
the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back
to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she
unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but until Tuesday night, they had never agreed to turn the
child over to his father, repeatedly asking for further legal
review of whether the child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, had said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''
