   CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody
case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies
to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno. Meanwhile,
Elian's Miami relatives react with anger to a report by a
pediatrician who is advising the federal government. The
pediatrician says the boy is being psychologically abused by the
relatives and should be removed from their home immediately.

   MIDEAST-JOURNAL _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Palestinian Jihad
Mubarak was destined to be a fighter in the war against the
Israelis. Instead, he sells them antiques. His uncle, a doctor in
the Jordanian army, delivered him on May 1, 1948, two weeks before
the Arab states attacked the new state of Israel. Name him Jihad,
the uncle ordered. It's Arabic for a Muslim sacred cause or, in
this case, a Holy War. Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian,
but with war coming, it seemed appropriate. But Mubarak, turning 52
this week, has focused his life on beautiful antiques, cars and, he
admits, women. When the 1967 war began and the19-year-old Mubarak
might have fought, the same uncle that delivered him gave a medical
excuse out of the war. Jolly and easy going, the gray-haired
Mubarak sells antiques to Israelis, and has never fought them. His
nondescript store, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, is one of the
most peaceful spots I've found here, a place where Israelis, Arabs
and foreign visitors browse over collectibles from Europe, Syria
and made in Bethlehem. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 30. WITH PHOTO.

   ESTATE-TAX _ Efforts to end the estate tax are gaining momentum
in Congress. Democrats say eliminating the tax would give billions
of dollars to the nation's wealthiest people, but Republicans say
``death tax'' reform is necessary to save family businesses and
farms. (Sherman, Cox News Service). 35.

   INTERNET-POLITICS _ WASHINGTON _ Traditionally, presidential
candidates have either tightly controlled the process of writing
their party's political platforms or else ignored planks that
didn't suit their campaign needs. But the Internet has now made
possible far broader citizen activist involvement than ever before
in the drafting process. Both the Democrats and Republicans are
finding new ways of using these high-tech tools in writing their
platforms. (Glass, Cox News Service). 20.

   CIVILRIGHTS-ISLAM _ WHITE HALL, Ala. _ State and federal
governments are planning to build an interpretive center in White
Hall, Alabama, to commemorate major events of the civil rights
movement. But the government's plan pales in comparison to a
proposal for a $47 million rural Islamic complex for the tiny town
drawn up by accused cop killer Jamil Abdulla Al-Amin. (Davis-Suggs,
