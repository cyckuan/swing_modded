HAVANA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The six-year old Cuban boy Elian
Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane
Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven-
month long bitter custody battle.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the Cuban National
Assembly of People's Power, Elian's family members in Cuba and his
classmates are among the several hundred people welcoming him at
Jose Marti airport where the plane landed at 7.45 p.m. local time
(2345 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The plane took off at Washington Dulles International Airport
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal by Elian
relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Elian's custody battle began after he survived a shipwreck that
killed his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants on November
22, 1999. The boy was soon in the center of a campaign to bring
him back to Cuba by his father and relatives in Cuba and to keep
him in the United States by his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Elian's return constitutes a major victory to President Fidel
Castro and the Cuban people who have time and again demonstrated
to demand the return of the shipwreck survivor boy to his
Caribbean homeland in Cuba, observers here say.
