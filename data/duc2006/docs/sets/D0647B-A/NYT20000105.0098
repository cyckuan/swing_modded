   ROSA PARKS: AMERICA'S NO. 1 HEROINE OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF 20TH
CENTURY _ ``Since its earliest days as a nation, America has been
blessed with true heroes and heroines, which has caused me to
reject the temptation to join in naming the single `greatest man or
woman of the century,''' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``But
based on my 50 years in journalism and several decades of trying to
become an unbiased student of American history, I can't resist this
nomination of Rosa Parks as `The No. I Heroine of My 20th
Century.'' In this commentary, Jarrett recounts Parks' achievements
and milestones and the effects they had on the civil-rights
movement.

   ANOTHER CENSUS COUNTDOWN? _ The League of United Latin American
Citizens and other organizations hope to educate Hispanics on the
importance of an accurate population tally. In this commentary from
Hispanic Business magazine, Derek Reveron writes about the
importance of being counted. ``The federal government uses census
figures to determine where and how to apportion funds among county
and local jurisdictions. The feds also employ the figures to form
domestic policy and monitor civil rights laws. State and local
governments use the census numbers in redistricting,'' he writes.

   NATIVE-AMERICANS HOPE FOR A NEW WORLD OF ENLIGHTENMENT _ A
brilliant light reportedly shone on a recent September night in
Navajo country. Some native people believe the unexplained glow
represents a time shift more significant than the dawn of the new
millennium. Chippewa writer Elisabeth Dietz, co-author of a book on
Native-American prophecies called ``Now Is the Hour'' (Blue
Dolphin, 1988), said she believes the light marks an emergence into
another age, as foretold by her native elders. Columnist Karen
Lincoln Michel writes about what Dietz describes as a ``spiritual
rebirth'' for all people, not just Native-Americans. ``We're
entering a new world of enlightenment,'' Dietz says. ``We've just
come through a time where we've forgotten how to treat Mother Earth
and each other. Now we have to let go of the aggression toward the
Earth and learn to live in harmony.''

   EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS FOR GAYS LIKE US _ The Vermont Supreme
Court, with its recent same-sex marriage decision, has given the
gay community a rare opportunity _ the chance to ``persuade
lawmakers to provide the full badge of citizenship by recognizing
the freedom to marry,'' writes Columnist Chuck Colbert, who is
spending the holidays in Arizona, with his domestic partner's
family. Over time, Colbert and his partner have experienced full
acceptance and inclusion within the extended family circle. ``We
realize,'' he writes, ``that people of goodwill need a reasonable
period of time to get comfortable with the m-word's applying to
lesbian and gay couples. But personal discomfort should not hold
back the Vermont legislature from doing the right thing: legalize
same sex marriage.''

   FREEDOM AND HONOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE _ The drama of 10-year-old
Elian Gonzales who survived five days in Atlantic waters after his
refugee raft sunk, killing his mother, continues with Cuba's Fidel
Castro demanding his return and the Clinton administration's
wavering between justice and Castro. Should the mother's wishes be
honored even though she drowned in her failed effort to bring the
child to freedom? Or, should the White House bend to pressure from
Cuba? ``The boy should stay here, as the mother wished for
citizenship,'' writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.
