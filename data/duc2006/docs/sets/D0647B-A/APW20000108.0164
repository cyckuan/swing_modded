<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Protests Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case, said
Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the child
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil disobedience
campaign,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The organizers cited a ``more positive course'' in the ongoing custody
battle over the 6-year-old. That included a subpoena issued Friday by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House committee and efforts by
Elian's relatives to attain custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First thing that we want to see soon is that the administration is willing
to allow this process to take the course of family court, and perhaps also we
would like to see the administration more willing to listen to us,'' Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed
Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian
will actually be asked to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one
who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a
pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags
and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
</P>
<P>
	   Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the
child is reunited with his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me. I don't want to go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his
mother, stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States. Two
other adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that
would allow him to seek asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
