<HEADLINE> Elian Shown Reading Castro Message  </HEADLINE>

   HAVANA (AP) -- With Fidel Castro in the wings, Elian Gonzalez was
shown on state television Tuesday night reading the book that the
Cuban president gave him to commemorate the boy's successful
completion of first grade.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera panned over the dedication that the Cuban leader
wrote to Elian in the ''The Golden Age,'' a children's book by
Cuban independence hero Jose Marti, Castro's voice could be heard
in the background reading it aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ''For when you are in the fourth or fifth grade and can enjoy
one of the most tender works of Marti,'' Castro read off-camera. It
was signed, ''Affectionately, Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castro himself was never shown during the 45-minute program
on Elian's life in Cuba since his return on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Elian's return to Cuba had predicted that Castro
would parade the boy around like a poster boy for the revolutionary
government.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't occurred. But there have been television images of
Elian laughing and swimming in a pool, Elian singing Cuba's
national anthem, Elian writing his cursive letters on a blackboard
and in a composition book, Elian dancing with maracas, Elian
placing yellow gladiolas at a bronze statue of Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba state media on Saturday revealed very few details when they
reported last week's meeting between the 73-year-old head of state
and the 6-year-old boy. It was the first reported reunion of the
pair since Elian's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Castro had promised that Cuba would avoid a media circus upon
Elian's return to Cuba. He was even conspicuously absent at the
boy's airport homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Elian has been kept away from the media in a house
in west Havana, where the child, his family and a group of
classmates and teachers have been living.
</P>
<P>
   State television reported Friday night that Elian had received
his first-grade diploma after a special effort by teachers to help
him recover the time lost during his tumultuous stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government initially said that Elian and his family
would take a week's holiday after the boy completed his studies,
uniformed police Tuesday continued to block all traffic around the
house -- an indication that they may still be there.
</P>
<P>
   The government initially said that after the weeklong vacation,
the Gonzalez family was to return to their home in Cardenas, a
small port city two-hours east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian survived a boat sinking that killed his mother and 10
others.
</P>
<P>
   After the child was rescued on Nov. 25, he became the subject of
an international custody dispute between his father in Cuba and
their relatives in the United States, who fought unsuccessfully all
the way to the Supreme Court to block his repatriation.
