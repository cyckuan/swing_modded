   UNDATED - CNN is like a 24-hour record store: You don't require
its services all the time, but it's nice to know it's there if you
need it.
</P>
<P>
   The network George Bush watched during the Persian Gulf War
celebrates 20 years today - 20 years of all news, all the time -
even when there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   We've talked before about the kinds of problems this presents.
When other networks, such as MSNBC and Fox News, jumped into the
24-hour fray, competition somehow bred idiocy - turning the Elian
Gonzales story into a Huge Event, for instance, fueling the
frustrations both sides felt until a firecracker became a powder
keg.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when gun-toting feds finally burst into the home where Elian
was staying, it sure was nice to have the 24-hour guys around so we
could see what was happening. So, like anything else, 24-hour news
is a trade-off; the best you can hope for is that the good
outweighs the bad. And with CNN, it usually does.
</P>
<P>
   When the space shuttle Challenger exploded, we were glued to the
set. When Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett crawled
underneath a table in Baghdad and kept reporting as the city was
being bombed, people of my generation got a taste of what hearing
World War II radio broadcasts was like.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, CNN has given us ``Larry King Live'' and
``Crossfire,'' a big honkin' loogie in the eye of the traditional
interview show and news-talk roundtable, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But with local TV news being nothing more than a police lineup
broken up with the occasional weather gimmick, it's good to have an
option when national news breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And when there's nothing going on? That's why ``MASH'' reruns
exist.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 has scheduled a movie each Wednesday night through Sept. 6,
including five original films, the first of which, ``It's Only Rock
and'' ``Roll,'' aired Wednesday. The rest: ``Daydream Believers:
The Monkees'' ``Story,'' on June 28 and repeating Aug. 2; ``Out of
Sync,'' on July 12; ``Meatloaf: Bat Out of Hell'' on July 26; and
``At Any Cost,'' on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Great, I guess. But between this and MTV's insipid programming,
where does a guy got to go to see a music video these days?
