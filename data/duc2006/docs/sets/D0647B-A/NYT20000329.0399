   MIAMI _ The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez
saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy's
father was ready to fly ``immediately'' to retrieve his son, while
the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, it remained far from clear whether the boy's relatives
would give him up voluntarily or if the area's powerful Cuban exile
community would try to prevent his return home, no matter what the
family decided to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passports are ready, and of course the airplane is
ready,'' Castro said in a television broadcast from Havana that
added another potentially volatile element to a political drama
that has captured international attention and caused deep divisions
within this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a vivid indication of just how intense the situation has
become, the mayors of 23 municipalities around Miami Wednesday
declared that they would not help federal forces if they tried to
take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five
hours Wednesday night, and will resume talks Thursday. Earlier
Wednesday, the Gonzalez family's spokesman said the family would
not accede to the INS's key demand: that they agree in writing to
surrender the boy if an appeals court orders that he be returned to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Absent such a guarantee by Wednesday, immigration officials had
threatened to revoke the boy's permission to remain in the United
States and seek custody of him at 9 a.m. Thursday. But late
Wednesday, they extended the deadline for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The family's defiant stance has set up a potentially explosive
scenario in which federal marshals may have to be dispatched to the
city's Little Havana section to remove the boy from the home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If anything like that happens, the area's mayors said at a press
conference, they not only would refuse to provide any of their law
enforcement personnel for support, but also would hold the Clinton
administration accountable for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lend our . . . police officers or any other
resources to assist the federal government in any way, shape, or
form to inappropriately repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who spoke for himself and the
mayors of 22 nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their continued provocation, in the form of unjustified
threats to revoke the boy's parole, leads to civil unrest and
violence, we are holding the federal government responsible, and
specifically Janet Reno and the president of the United States, for
anything that may occur in this community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penelas, who is of Cuban descent, said the local authorities
would maintain order if protests got out of control. But the
mayors' extraordinary proclamation demonstrated how profoundly the
differences over this issue have become in Southern Florida, where
Cuban-Americans make up about one-third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   They also served as a sort of official warning that widespread
demonstrations, which may be difficult to control, may be
inevitable if the INS carries out its promise to return Elian to
his father, even if Juan Miguel Gonzales comes to this country to
get his son, rather than waits for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton seemed concerned Wednesday about both the
prospect of violence and about the possibility that the Gonzalez
family in Miami, members of the Cuban exile community, and local
elected officials may be preparing to flout the federal
government's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the law would be followed by everyone,
including them,'' Clinton said at a press conference in Washington,
referring to Elian's relatives. ``I don't think they should be
singled out, and I don't think they should have extra pressure put
on them, but on the other hand I think they should observe the rule
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Juan
Gonzalez has said that he would go to the United States only after
his son's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that he follows through on the revised plan _ while the
case is still in the courts and Elian still lives at his
great-uncle's house _ it could help to resolve the conflict, since
his relatives have said that they would be willing to give the boy
to his father if he came to America.
</P>
<P>
   But the political and emotional atmosphere here has grown far
more heated since that suggestion was made, and the family's more
recent comments have indicated that they may think Elian would be
better off in this country regardless of what else happens.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some officials of the Cuban exile community have
made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to Cuba and
will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening. A convoy
of large trucks, their drivers blaring their horns and shouting
their support for Elian, circled the neighborhood in which the boy
is living Wednesday and vowed to come back in greater numbers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to
form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to
keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States. Elian has been with
his relatives here since being rescued last Thanksgiving, laying on
an inner tube in the waters off Florida; he was one of three
survivors of an accident in which his mother and 10 other Cubans
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to kill everyone here,'' said Jose
Prado, a retired General Motors worker, when asked what would
happen if the federal government tried to return the boy to Cuba.
Prado was one of scores of Cuban-Americans standing behind a police
barracade near the Gonzalez home throughout the day Wednesday,
showing support for Elian remaining here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these exiles are going to jump this fence and fight
whatever we have to fight,'' said Olgalidia Garcia, a recent high
school graduate, as about a dozen people surrounding her vigorously
nodded in agreement. ``And we are going to block whatever we have
to block.''
