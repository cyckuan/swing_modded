 &HT;    MIAMI TENSIONS RISE AS HAVANA OFFERS TO SEND ELIAN'S FATHER

end of day's negotiations in Miami.

<P>
   MIAMI _ With tensions rising and officials warning the city may
explode in protest, the showdown over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez racheted to an even higher level late Wednesday as
officials in Havana said Elian's father could come to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The development came as negotiations between federal immigration
officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse. U.S.
officials postponed a deadline for revoking the boy's custody
status.
</P>
<P>
   After months of angry rhetoric, Cuban leader Fidel Castro said
he would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to come to the United States
along with some of his son's school classmates and a team of
psychologists to live with Elian until the court battle over the
boy's fate ends, CNN reported.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials about the
proposed trip, and it was not clear if or when the visit would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ended a
tense five-hour meeting Wednesday night with Elain's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzales, who has cared for the boy since he was rescued at
sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting centered on an INS demand that Gonzalez pledge to
turn the boy over for a return to Cuba if the family loses its
court fight to keep Elian in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials emerged from their Miami offices about 9
p.m. EST, saying the meeting had reached no conclusion and would
resume Thursday. They postponed until Friday a deadline for
revoking Elian's parole, which could mean he might soon be taken
away from his Miami family, perhaps for a return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami's Cuban exiles held a huge rally in the
neighborhood known as Little Havana. Thousands of people gathered
in the darkness, shining flashlights into the sky and vowing to
continue their protests against any effort to return Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, more than a hundred protesters milled outside
Lazaro Gonzalez's home, chanting, praying and vowing to form a
human chain to keep the boy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to show the world that we're united and that we're
not going to allow Elian to go back to Cuba,'' said Hortensia
Prado(cq), one of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent prelude to what might come if the government
moves to take the boy, a convoy of dump trucks chugged down the
narrow streets of the neighborhood, horns blaring to the cheers of
the protesters. The drivers vowed to block all the streets leading
to the home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local officials lashed out at Attorney General Janet
Reno and President Clinton, warning that Miami's Cuban exiles may
burst into angry protest if Elian is removed before his court
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're provoking the community,'' Miami-Dade County Mayor
Alex Penelas said of Clinton and Reno. ``They keep pushing and
pushing the envelope and when it explodes, no one is going to be
able to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a noon press conference, Penelas and 20 other local officials
vowed that local police would make no effort to assist federal
officers should they try to remove the boy before his court case is
finished. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also issued a statement saying no
state officers would assist, either.
</P>
<P>
   After critics said the mayor was essentially inviting the
community to protest, Penelas issued another statement saying
police would not tolerate disruptions in the streets, such as the
ones that erupted in January after the initial decision by federal
officials that Elian should go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to the comments at a Washington news
conference by saying, ``I like the mayor very much but I believe in
the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the city appeared on the brink of some sort of
outburst, immigration officials repeated Wednesday that even if the
9 a.m. deadline comes and they revoke Elian's parole, they do not
plan to immediately go the Lazaro Gonzales's home and forcibly
remove the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obligation is on them,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
said in a television interview. ``They have said they intend to be
law-abiding, and we are relying on them to be law-abiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug of war
since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on
Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their
boat sank as they fled Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of
his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian
should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family then filed a federal court suit to challenge
the federal decision and to request an asylum hearing for the boy,
but last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them. The family
then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
which on Monday set oral arguments for May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the complicated standoff is the fact that since he
was rescued at sea, Elian has been legally in the custody of Reno.
Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore
the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that she would allow the appeal to be heard, but
has insisted that Lazaro Gonzalez sign a statement promising to
voluntarily turn Elian over if the family loses the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite edging up the pressure on the family, federal officials
have said they are reluctant to forcibly take the boy against the
family's will. But the family seems adamantly opposed to turning
the boy over until all legal channels have been exhausted,
including a possible hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's
exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the
never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. The boy has been the
subject of poems, paintings and an almost religious fervor, with
some people recently flocking to a bank near Lazaro Gonzalez's home
where a figure has appeared in a glass window that many believe
resembles the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Such intense feelings left worried police officials planning for
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great concerns that I can't see a peaceful resolution
to this situation,'' said Miami Police Chief William O'Brien.
