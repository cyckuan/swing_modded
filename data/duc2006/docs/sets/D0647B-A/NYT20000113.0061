   EDITORIAL-ELIAN _ Janet Reno clarified Elian Gonzales' legal
situation by brushing aside Florida judge's interference.
Immigration, after all, is a federal matter. Now she needs to
expedite adjudication. Elian has been separated from his father
long enough. Besides, opportunists are preparing to confer U.S.
citizenship on Elian when Congress reconvenes Jan. 24. (Atlanta
Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-TEENS _ Raise the driving age to 17. (Atlanta
Constitution). 8.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I surrender. For just over
a year, I have fought a losing battle against referring to 2000,
the much ballyhooed Y2K, as the beginning of the 21st century or
the beginning of the new millennium. I'm waving the white flag and
joining the crowd. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Democrats who controlled
redistricting of the Texas Senate last decade did such a good job
of packing Republican-leaning districts with Republican voters that
none of the six Republicans seeking re-election this year drew
Democratic opposition. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Judging from the inability thus far
of the nation's cartoonists to get a bead on Bush, I wonder from
where any enthusiasm comes. Few figures of such note have been
missed by such a wide mark by their caricatures. (John Young is
opinion page editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
