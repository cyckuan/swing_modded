<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls For Elian Protest  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA

<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Thursday called a demonstration of a
half-million women for Friday morning to protest a U.S. court
decision that would keep Elian Gonzalez from returning to his
homeland for at least another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The march of Cuban mothers and grandmothers would be the largest
single rally since the beginning of the international custody
dispute began after Elian was rescued at sea in late November.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. appellate court panel sided Thursday with Elian's father
in the 6-month-old international custody battle, saying that
immigration officials had been entitled to deny an asylum hearing
for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But under the ruling, Elian must remain in the United States for
14 days to give his Miami relatives a chance to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not cross our arms in the face of this prolonging of
the injustice and the crime,'' the government said in a statement
read Thursday on state television.
</P>
<P>
   The statement decried Elian's ''cruel and interminable wait to
return to the bosom of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even members of a visiting American congressional delegation
found the additional delay frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like the family in Miami will just want to drag this
on,'' said U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat in
Havana this week with members of the congressional Black Caucus.
''I don't understand it. It's clear that the child should be in the
custody of his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have fought to keep Elian with them in the
United States, arguing that they can give him a better life off the
communist island. Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has
demanded his parental rights as the child's sole surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others perished in late November when
their boat sank during a journey from Cuba to the United States.
Two men on a fishing trip rescued Elian off the Florida coast after
finding him floating on an innertube.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian,
who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez traveled to the United States on April 6 in
hopes of reclaiming his son and returning with him to the island,
but the Miami relatives refused to turn the child over to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were reunited on April 22 after Elian was taken
forcibly from the Miami relatives' home during an armed federal
raid. Elian has since lived with his father in the Washington area
while awaiting the decision.
