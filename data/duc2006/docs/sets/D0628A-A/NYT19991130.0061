   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ There's no point in getting angry about
taxes. Maybe it's emotionally satisfying, but it won't do any good.
What will help is focusing on things we can control. When it comes
to taxes, that means finding ways to make the tax laws work for us.

   ADULT-ADHD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ADHD has only within the
last few years been recognized as a legitimate adult diagnosis. ``A
lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said Dr.
Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of psychiatry
and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
``We now know that's not true. Somewhere between 15-20 percent may
outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that impair
them markedly as adults.'' (Susman, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

   AIDS-TEEN _ ATLANTA _ 15-year-old Dylan Edwards doesn't have
HIV, but he is just as much a casualty of the AIDS epidemic as
those who are infected with the virus. Dylan's life has been
dominated by AIDS since he was 3 years old, when both of his
parents and his younger brother were found to be HIV-positive. His
father died of AIDS 9 years ago; his 12-year-old brother Chris died
last month. Aside from a serious bout with shingles in 1994, his
mother has been healthy _ but she's not on any AIDS drugs right
now. Dylan has grown up in the shadow of his brother's illness. He
starred on the freshman football team this season, but no one from
his family came to the games _ his mom was at Scottish Rite
Hospital with Chris. Dylan is a bright, well-spoken boy, but does
poorly in school and seethes with barely concealed anger and
frustration. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH PHOTOS.

   PETS-WORK _ If she's not sacked out on a desk somewhere or
sprinting up the stairs after an officemate, look for Scarlett
begging a bit of barbecue from a coworker who's just come back from
the restaurant down the street. It may not be what you'd consider
proper office etiquette, but as long as she's not piddling on the
carpet or barging uninvited into staff meetings, Scarlett and
others like her are welcome at a growing number of Austin companies
that allow employees to bring dogs to work. (LeBlanc, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS. MOVED.

   HOME AND GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   GARDENS-SEA _ On its surface, Gardens By The Sea, written and
published by the Garden Club of Palm Beach, would seem to have a
fairly limited audience. The introduction, written by local
horticulturist Gene Joyner, calls it ``an in-depth how-to book on
the trials and successes of gardening on oceanfront and near
oceanfront property.'' (Palm Beach Post).MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING-LIFE _ MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Lee May conducts his first
``burn'' in Fightingtown Creek. The mission: get rid of as much of
the myriad of suckering sourwood stumps, briar thickets and
scraggly pines as possible. The mountain folks know ``it makes a
lot more sense to burn this stuff in place than to try hauling it
away.'' So, he lit up a pile and after it was safely burned out, he
lit the next. Until all piles were gone. ``My first burn.'' (May,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO.

   ROSES _ DALTON,Ga. _ Sam Pullen of Dalton knows roses. He knows
them so well in fact that he's still able to gather several dozens
a day even though it's December. What's his secret? ``The more you
pick them, the more they bloom,'' Sam says, ``It takes a lot out of
the rose bush if you don't cut them often.'' During peak season in
June, Sam has picked as many as 30 dozen in one day from his 750
hybrid tea and floribunda bushes. (Flanders, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)WITH PHOTOS.
