<HEADLINE> Lawsuits: Ritalin maker encouraged overdiagnosis of child disorders </HEADLINE>

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two lawsuits filed this week accuse the
makers of the drug Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association
of encouraging overdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children to
boost sales of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp. and the American Psychiatric
Association promoted the belief that a large number of children
need to take Ritalin for attention deficit disorder or attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits filed in New Jersey
and California allege.
</P>
<P>
   A similar suit against the East Hanover, N.J.-based maker of the
drug and the American Psychiatric Association was filed earlier
this year in Texas. The latest suits were filed Wednesday in state
Superior Court in Hackensack and in San Diego federal court by some
of the same attorneys who filed huge lawsuits against gun makers
and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis and Ciba-Geigy Corp., which produced Ritalin before it
merged to form Novartis in 1996, also donated hundreds of thousands
of dollars to an organization of members with attention deficit or
hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits say.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies and the American Psychiatric Association
worked together to include the diagnosis of the two disorders and
list it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders in 1980, creating a huge market for the drug, the
lawsuits say.
</P>
<P>
   The companies released misleading sales literature about
Ritalin's effectiveness, ''without ever advising ... that Ritalin
usage would not stimulate or improve academic performance and/or
have any long-term effect on the symptoms associated with ADD or
and/or ADHD,'' the California lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis released a statement Friday calling the charges
''unfounded and preposterous'' and noted that attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been recognized by medical
experts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychiatric Association also denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The APA will defend itself vigorously by presenting a mountain
of scientific evidence to refute these meritless allegations and we
are confident that we will prevail,'' the association said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children - about
3 million, mostly boys - are believed to have attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The symptoms of short attention
span, impulsive behavior and difficulty sitting still are also
associated with youthful rambunctiousness, which has raised
questions of whether youngsters are being overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional hearings recently examined whether Ritalin, a
brand name for the stimulant methylphenidate, is overprescribed for
the disorders. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first
guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating
that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed on behalf of boys who took the drug in both
New Jersey and California, say that Ciba-Geigy Corp. began a
conspiracy to boost the Ritalin market in the mid-1950s, leading to
the creation of the ADD diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual. In 1987, the diagnosis was expanded to attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits say that the drug's makers gave $748,000 to the
California advocacy group Children and Adults with
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder between 1991 and 1994 to
help promote Ritalin sales.
