<HEADLINE> FTC charges company over attention disorder supplement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission charged a New
York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its
dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Organics Inc., of Melville, N.Y., claims in advertising
that its Pedi-Active A.D.D. supplement can alleviate symptoms of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and improve the attention
span of children who have difficulty focusing on schoolwork, the
FTC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned
about it should talk to their children's doctors about appropriate
treatment,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of
Consumer Protection. She asserted that the company's ads prey on
parents seeking alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the
most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million
school-age children in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Organics did not immediately return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which does business as ''Nature's Plus,'' markets
and sells a variety of dietary supplements through independent
retail stores. Sixty tablets of Pedi-Active A.D.D. sell for $12.56.
</P>
<P>
   This is the FTC's fifth action involving products marketed to
treat ADHD. While the commission's complaint begins a legal process
seeking to stop future unsupported claims, it doesn't mean any laws
have been broken.
