BRAIN SCAN FOUND EFFECTIVE IN DIAGNOSING ATTENTION DISORDER

<P>
   Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in
people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem
that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US
schoolchildren, scientists say..
</P>
<P>
   It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for
ADHD, say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense
dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being
overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it could reveal whether there are different forms
of ADHD that respond better or worse to specific drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting, promising, beginning,'' said Dr. Edward
Hallowell, a psychiatrist and author of ``Driven to Distraction,''
a book about ADHD. He was not involved in the study. A test would
be welcome, he said, ``because now it's based on the person's
history and psychological testing, so there's an element of
ambiguity'' about the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible,
unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in
school, social life and careers.
</P>
<P>
   Previously suspected causes such as family surroundings, diet
and allergies have largely been discarded as mounting evidence
implicates brain abnormalities probably due to altered genes, said
Russell A. Barkley, an ADHD researcher in the psychology and
psychiatry departments of the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The brain scanning experiment found a chemical imbalance, which
had been previously suspected, in a part of the brain that uses the
nerve messenger dopamine. Dopamine helps regulate attention and
inhibits impulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Six adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD with
standard tests had on average 70 percent more of a protein called
the dopamine transporter than did a group of 30 normal volunteers,
said the researchers. ``I think it's very exciting,'' said Dr.
Thomas Spencer, an MGH researcher and an author of the study. ``It
was stunning that a problem in their brain corresponded to their
symptoms'' in all six ADHD patients.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the study will be published Saturday as a letter in
the British journal Lancet. In the brief article, the Massachusetts
researchers described injecting patients with a radioactively
tagged chemical agent called Altropane, which accumulated in
dramatically higher levels in a particular part of the dopamine
system in the brains of the ADHD patients.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder varies a great deal among people, so the new method
will have to prove itself able to diagnose a wide range of ADHD
types, and also needs confirmation in children, the researchers
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not yet a diagnostic test'' because it
involved a ``very refined sample'' of ADHD patients who aren't
representative of the entire spectrum of those who have it, said
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   But if confirmed, he added, the test could help answer skeptics
who question whether ADHD is a real disorder, and not just a poorly
defined label placed on very active, normally rebellious chldren.
Barkley noted, though, that gene tests for ADHD may arrive at the
same time or even more quickly than the scanning test.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was
supported by Boston Life Sciences, Inc., which says it intends to
develop Altropane as an ADHD test. It has already made a test using
Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease, the
degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing
nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Altropane, said Dr. Alan J. Fischman, an MGH nuclear medicine
specialist and senior author of the study, is a synthetic analogue
of cocaine. Its molecules bind very tightly to molecules in the
brain known as dopamine transporters, which regulate the amount of
dopamine in certain parts of the brain. (People injected with
Altropane for the imaging tests don't feel any cocaine-like effects
because the amount is so small, Fischman said.)
</P>
<P>
   Altropane was designed by Bertha K. Madras of Harvard's New
England Regional Primate Center in Southboro, Mass., who first had
the idea of measuring the dopamine transporter in Parkinson disease
and ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea came from a study I had done in the 1980s showing
that Ritalin targets the dopamine transporter'' and binds to it
tightly, said Madras. She suggested that the dopamine transporter
might be a key player in ADHD, and if so, measuring the amount of
the molecules could serve as a test.
</P>
<P>
   After showing that Altropane homed in on different dopamine
structures in Parkinson disease and was developed as a test for it,
the researchers, in an alliance with Boston Life Sciences, turned
to ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental test required the volunteers to have Altropane
injected intravenously. As it flowed through the brain, Altropane
accumulated in the dopamine transporter molecules of the patients
with ADHD and the difference between them and the normal patients
was detected with an instrument known as a SPECT scanner. It took
30 to 45 minutes for the instrument to make the measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are in the process of designing larger studies,
probably involving hundreds of patients, to determine how reliable
and accurate the method will prove to be. Testing the Altropane
technique on children can come only after ethics review boards are
convinced that it is safe, said the scientists.
