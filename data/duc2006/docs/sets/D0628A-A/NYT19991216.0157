 &HT;    EXPERIMENT POINTS TO TEST FOR CHILDHOOD ATTENTION DISORDER
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have
demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein
in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The test suggests that parents of children suspected of having
the learning and behavioral problem may someday be able to have
their children tested before deciding whether to have them take
potent and controversial drugs such as Ritalin and other
stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertha Madras, one of the Harvard Medical School researchers
who performed the initial test, said many more experiments must be
performed before such a test is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial data is robust,'' she said Thursday in a telephone
interview, ``but a cascade of experiments have to be done before we
can say we have a diagnostic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5
percent of children in the United States. In general, it affects
such functions as working memory, self-control and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Madras, a professor of biopsychology at the medical school, said
the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in
concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter.
</P>
<P>
   By linking a radioactive iodine molecule to a substance that
locks onto the dopamine transporter, the researchers were able to
use imaging instruments to directly measure the concentrations of
transporter.
</P>
<P>
   The study is described in a report being published Friday in the
British medical journal, the Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   The finding appears to confirm theories about the way ADHD
affects its victims, but Madras said tests on larger populations of
adults and later on children must be performed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have applied for Food and Drug Administration
approval for a second test with a larger group of adults, she said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and psychiatrists say the condition seems to
affect girls and boys differently.
</P>
<P>
   Most girls with ADHD have a form known as Type A, which is
characterized primarily by inattentiveness and distractibility, and
less by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The most common form among boys is known as Type B. Rather than
flightiness, persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and
impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   A Type C involves symptoms of both Types A and B. And Type D
patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life, but none
that clearly fit the other three forms.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that academic performance of 90 percent of
the school-age patients improves with stimulant medication,
principally the drug methylphenidate, marketed as Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate
shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is
addictive to test animals.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the most commonly diverted and stolen
substances in America, and more high school students are reported
to abuse it than receive it under prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the diagnosis of ADHD is based on behavioral studies
and can involve often-subjective judgements on the part of
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus development panel convened last year by the National
Institutes of Health recommended continued use of stimulant drugs
for ADHD, but also called for more research toward understanding
the nature of the disease and developing a more precise diagnostic
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chemical reasons for ADHD are not clearly
understood, scientists have speculated that the brain's failure to
control the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays
signals between nerve cells, is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, some researchers believe the transporter protein _
the ``truck'' that moves dopamine from one cell to the next _ is
key to the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the transporter protein gathers up the dopamine after
it has stimulated its target cells and returns it to the cells that
released it.
</P>
<P>
   Methyphenidate, cocaine and other stimulant drugs are known to
inhibit the transporter protein. By taking the ``trucks'' off the
highway, the drugs cause dopamine to build up and continue to
stimulate its targeted nerve cells, Madras explained.
</P>
<P>
   This has the paradoxical effect of calming persons with ADHD.
Some researchers think this is because their condition stems from a
deficiency of target cells or of the cell receptors that react with
dopamine.
