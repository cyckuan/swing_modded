	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Ten days after he began taking a widely  
used medicine called Adderall to control his attention deficit 
disorder and help him with his college studies, Ryan Ehlis slipped 
into a psychotic fog and killed his infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	God, he said, told him to do it.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 24-year-old University of North Dakota student is out  
of jail and back in school, acquitted of murder by a judge who 
ruled his psychotic state was an extremely rare side effect of 
Adderall. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say that despite the  
slaying, Adderall remains a safe and effective drug for controlling 
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days after taking the medicine in January, Ehlis started  
hearing voices. He believed God was telling him to leave his body 
and bring his daughter with him to save the world, said his lawyer, 
John Thelen. 
</P>
<P>
	His conditioned worsened until, on Jan. 30, Ehlis killed his  
5-week-old daughter, Tara, with a shotgun, then shot himself in the 
abdomen. He recovered from the wound and was charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, psychiatrists testified before a judge that  
the shootings happened solely because of a psychotic state caused 
by the prescription drug. Judge Debbie Kleven agreed, ruling that 
Ehlis lacked the capacity to understand what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehlis has declined comment on the case but said he returned to  
normal days after he stopped taking the medication. He is back home 
with his common-law wife and three other children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing very well, and my family is doing pretty good, too,  
considering the circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug's labeling warns that in very rare cirumstances, it can  
cause ``psychotic episodes at recommended doses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always been aware there was a very slight risk of  
psychotic side effects with this drug, but this was the most severe 
case that's ever occurred,'' said Stefan Antonsson, vice president 
of marketing for Shire Richwood Inc., the Florence, Ky., maker of 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Adderall was made available on a widespread basis in 1996,  
the company has received 10 reports of ``general psychotic events'' 
from the drug's use, Antonsson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all seemed to resolve without significant injury to the  
user or other people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a million Adderall prescriptions were written in 1997,  
Antonsson said. That figure rose to 2.3 million in 1998, and in the 
first nine months of this year the number has increased to 2.7 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During clinical trials of the drug, Antonsson said, there were  
no reported instances of psychotic disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are advised to prescribe it under close medical  
supervision. Ehlis did not seek medical attention, apparently 
because he did not realize he was having a psychotic event. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Swanson, a professor at the University of California  
at Irvine who has studied Adderall, said he was surprised to hear 
of Ehlis' violent reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that in high doses this would be a real concern, but  
not at the typical doses that are prescribed for clinical 
treatment,'' Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thelen said the drug was prescribed to Ehlis by a psychiatrist,  
and Ehlis was taking the prescribed dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy, Ehlis had been diagnosed with ADHD and had taken  
Ritalin. Adderall is considered similar to Ritalin but is thought 
to be more effective in some cases for ADHD. Ritalin also carries a 
warning about potential psychosis in extremely rare cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of 10 extreme reactions to Adderall known by the company,  
Antonsson described how a 7-year-old boy became aggressive and 
defiant. When the boy quit using the drug, he improved, Antonsson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehlis is taking no medication for his ADHD, his lawyer said.
