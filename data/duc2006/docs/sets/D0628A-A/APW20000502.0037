<HEADLINE> Pediatrics Academy Issues ADHD Guide  </HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's pediatricians are being asked to
take an active role in diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder amid concern that merely rambunctious children are being
given unnecessary medication.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first
guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and
make sure untreated children get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are for children 6 through 12. Most ADHD research
has involved that age group, and the academy also said it
recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal
rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   However, recent research shows dramatic increases in the use of
drugs like Ritalin to treat children with ADHD, suggesting the
disorder is either becoming more common or is being overdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, the nation's largest group of pediatricians, said
it is unclear whether the disorder is being overdiagnosed, because
doctors' definitions and treatment of it varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize
the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really
need help. Guidelines for treating ADHD are still being developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to help us all (diagnose) more accurately,'' said
Dr. James Perrin, an author of the guidelines and an associate
professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- or an
average of about 2.5 million, most of them boys -- are believed to
have ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive
behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin is often prescribed to increase a child's alertness. But
many experts have pointed out that its long-term effects on
children are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines, a child must
exhibit symptoms in at least two settings, such as at home and at
school. The symptoms must harm the child's academic or social
functioning for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the academy has drawn up guidelines for a
behavioral ailment. The academy began developing them three years
ago, said Dr. Martin Stein, co-author and a pediatrics professor at
the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also suggest that pediatricians and family
doctors take a leading role in addressing the disorder, with
information about the child's behavior from parents and teachers.
Doctors also should use criteria from the American Psychiatric
Association's diagnostic manual of mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Involving pediatricians in the diagnosis of ADHD is ''really
exciting because they're seeing these kids more than child
psychiatrists,'' said Dr. Karen Pierce, a child psychiatrist in
Chicago who helped develop the standards. ''It will add a new
dimension and actually be able to help a lot more kids.''
