 &HT;    RITALIN SALES DOUBLE, WHILE ATTENTION DISORDER IS DEBATED

   WASHINGTON _ When a little green pill turns a miserable, rowdy,
troublemaking kid into an attentive, quiet and apparently happy
youngster, it is either correcting an imbalance of brain chemistry
or suppressing the child's natural spontaneity and innovative
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on who's describing it.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of the pill, the stimulant methylphenidate, which is
marketed under the trade name Ritalin, have more than doubled in
the past decade as more and more parents, teachers and therapists
turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug, which acts on the brain in much the same way as
cocaine, is increasingly used to make better students out of
elementary school children deemed to have ``developmental
disorders,'' a growing number of specialists has begun to question
the wisdom of using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines
are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of psychiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians,
pharmacologists and educators will listen to experts on different
sides of the controversy before attempting Wednesday to issue a
``consensus statement'' on ADHD and its treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, assembled by the National Institutes of Health, heard
its first presentations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking away their vitality with psychostimulants that
can cause irreversible brain damage,'' Dr. Peter Breggin, a
Maryland psychiatrist, told the panel Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But referring to findings from sophisticated brain-imaging
equipment, other experts insisted people with ADHD suffer from
identifiable brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Certain areas appear to be smaller than normal and are less
active during mental tests. Theories about the cause range from
genetics to injuries suffered during fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   For such conditions and the chemical imbalances that develop
because of them, some experts said, methylphenidate is the best
treatment currently available.
</P>
<P>
   People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed
as having ADHD _ impulsiveness, inability to concentrate,
difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain
receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine,
according to this view.
</P>
<P>
   Like cocaine, methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that
removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it increases the time the reduced number of receptors
is exposed to dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be as simple as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while ADHD has been thought of as a temporary
condition that children ``grow out of,'' recent findings suggest it
may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Food and Drug Administration has approved the sale
of methylphenidate on the basis of short-term studies of its safety
and effectiveness, no one knows the impact of long-range use of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1990 and 1995, there was a 2 1/2-fold increase in
sales of methylphenidate,'' said Andrew Rowland, a researcher at
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ``We need
to generate long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of this
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to other researchers Tuesday morning, the panel
is to discuss the ADHD-drug issue privately in the afternoon and
issue a consensus panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Specific questions the consensus committee is charged with
answering include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether ADHD is, in fact, a disorder.
</P>
<P>
   _ What impact it has on individuals, families and society.
</P>
<P>
   _ What are the effective treatments?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are their risks?
</P>
<P>
   _ What directions should future research take?
</P>
