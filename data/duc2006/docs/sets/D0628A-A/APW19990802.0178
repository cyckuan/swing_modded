<HEADLINE> Study Eases Hyperactivity Drug Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as  
Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as 
teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts not involved in the study said it was flawed and  
too small to reach meaningful conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75  
with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the 
findings should help allay concerns that giving children 
potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful 
habits later. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3 million school-age children have ADHD, and as  
many as half may be taking Ritalin or other stimulants, past 
research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a mythology that the use of these medications  
could `prime' children to become addicts in the future or could 
develop `a culture of drug taking,''' said Dr. Joseph Biederman of 
Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the study. It is 
published in the August issue of Pediatrics' ``electronic pages,'' 
an Internet extension of the journal published by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that children with ADHD who are medically treated  
will have fewer problems resulting from their disorder and more 
successful lives, probably giving them fewer reasons to experiment 
with substance abuse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritalin acts on dopamine, a brain chemical that helps regulate  
thinking. It is believed to calm hyperactivity by helping 
children's brains disregard distracting stimuli, such as classroom 
noise, so they can focus on learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of  
families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children. The 
children and their mothers were interviewed on three occasions -- 
when they entered the study, one year later and four years after 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19  
ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	At the study's end, 75 percent of the unmedicated ADHD subjects  
had substance abuse disorders, compared with 25 percent of the 
medicated subjects. Abused substances included alcohol, marijuana, 
hallucinogens, cocaine and other stimulants. Eighteen percent of 
the non-ADHD subjects were substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the study, psychologist Nadine Lambert of the  
University of California at Berkeley, said it was too small to show 
significant differences in rates of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Her own research involving more than 200 ADHD subjects tracked  
for more than 20 years shows that those who took stimulant 
medication were more likely to be cocaine and tobacco abusers as 
adults than non-medicated subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert said she is not opposed to treating ADHD youngsters with  
stimulants because the benefits have been shown clearly, but she 
believes there are risks and they should be acknowledged.
