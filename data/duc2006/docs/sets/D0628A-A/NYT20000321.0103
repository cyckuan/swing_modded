<P>
   The Clinton administration vows to tackle a question that's been
on the minds of physicians for a while: is America overmedicating
its children with psychiatric drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by an alarming increase in the use of such drugs as
Ritalin and Prozac among preschoolers and other youngsters, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says $5 million will be spent at the
National Institute of Mental Health to study the impact of
psychiatric drugs on children younger than 7 years old. In
addition, the US Food and Drug Administration will start a process
to improve the labeling of some of these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found a steep rise in the number of children receiving
prescriptions for psychiatric drugs, such as a 200 percent increase
of the number of pre-schoolers on antidepressants between 1991 and
1995. And the number of children younger than 5 taking clonidine,
used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or those
exhibiting disruptive behavior, increased 28-fold.
</P>
<P>
   While Boston-area psychiatrists were encouraged by the extra
spending on more studies, some cautioned not to bash psychiatrists
for overmedicating young children and said that when used properly,
the drugs help.
</P>
<P>
   While there are instances when mistakes are made, ``many
children are dramatically helped by treatment with medications not
technically approved or labeled in their age group,'' said Dr.
Joseph Gold, who is the clinical director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not just Ritalin. It's almost across the board in child
psychiatry,'' said Gold. ``The urgency of providing relief for an
individual child can be great, for the child and the family, and
can't wait years for it to be studied,'' said Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a
psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause
children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as
environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and
in most extreme case, response to abuse. Severe marital stress or
financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other
psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child
always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a
task, or is this something new,'' said Gold, who added that often
behavioral and other educational help is tried first before
approaching medication.
</P>
<P>
   But Joni Ketter, of the American Federation of Teachers, said
that many school nurses have told her that they are surprised at
the large number of children taking the medications. Ketter said
she spoke to one elementary school nurse from Philadelphia who
reported administering Ritalin to 44 students each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers and nurses are concerned about the use of the
drugs,'' said Ketter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist, said the funding
dedicated to looking at young children is good. ``We know a lot
more about the brain in the last 10 years and have developed
wonderful new medications, but the bad news is that there's not
been nearly enough funding and research in children,'' said
Hallowell. ``One of the big problems is that we don't have data.''
</P>
<P>
   While psychiatrists said that there are cases of overmedication
and undermedication, part of the problem is that psychiatric
disorders are diagnosed clinically, which means that decisions are
based on the history of clinical signs and symptoms. No simple
diagnostic blood test tells doctors or parents that their children
may have a serious psychiatric disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is insurance, and its tendency to pay for
medications instead of therapy or time spent with a patient. ``If
someone is expected to see more patients then the tendency is to
give medications, hoping that it will provide a quick answer,
instead of giving something comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Any physician can prescribe psychiatric drugs, not just
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of very effective treatment regimens for
childhood problems that do not involve medications that insurance
won't pay for,'' said Hallowell.
