<HEADLINE> ADHD May Be Overdiagnosed in Kids </HEADLINE>

	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Doctors may be overdiagnosing some groups of  
children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and 
overprescribing drugs to treat the condition, according to a new 
study published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers examined about 30,000 grade-school children in two  
districts in southeastern Virginia and found that pupils took drugs 
for ADHD in school at two to three times the expected rate, 
according to the study in the American Journal of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	ADHD is characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty in  
paying attention and keeping still. About 90 percent of patients 
take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to 
calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting 
stimuli. 
</P>
<P>
	ADHD has been estimated to affect 3 percent to 5 percent of  
school-age children nationwide, with less than 3 percent actually 
receiving medication, said Gretchen LeFever, a pediatric 
psychologist and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent  
of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD 
medication in school during the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe this many children have the specific  
brain-related problem called ADHD,'' said Ms. LeFever, assistant 
professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Center for Pediatric 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is a joint program of Eastern Virginia Medical School  
and Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFever said there probably are regions across the country  
with similar trends, indicating more research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very high rate of ADHD, by anyone's estimate,'' said  
psychologist Nadine M. Lambert of the University of California at 
Berkeley, a longtime ADHD researcher who was not involved in the 
current study. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers reviewed records of pupils enrolled in  
the second through fifth grades in Portsmouth and Virginia Beach. 
They chose those two cities because they were the most diverse in 
southeastern Virginia, Ms. LeFever said. Portsmouth is a small, 
urban, poor, mostly black district while Virginia Beach is a 
larger, wealthy and mostly white. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found that ADHD medication was used by three  
times as many boys as girls and twice as many whites as blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of the medication increased as children aged. By the fifth  
grade, 19 percent to 20 percent of white boys received ADHD drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Louis H. McCormick, a faculty member in the family medicine  
department at Louisiana State University medical school, said the 
study confirms what he has long suspected in his own 20-year 
practice, that kids are being overdiagnosed with ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that other conditions, such as anxiety or  
depression, can mimic the symptoms of ADHD, said McCormick, a 
family doctor in Franklin, La., who has given seminars on ADHD. He 
also is a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a blood test to evaluate ADHD. ADHD is an  
educated guess,'' McCormick said. ``... You need better data from 
all 50 states to really get a handle on the prevalence.''
