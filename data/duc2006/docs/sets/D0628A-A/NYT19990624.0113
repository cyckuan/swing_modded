 Dietary vitamin C link to lead levels elusive
<TEXT>
<P>

<P>
   A study associates high vitamin C levels in blood with decreased
high blood-lead levels. But while the research, published Wednesday
in the Journal of the American Medical Association, established the
inverse relationship, the authors found in questioning study
participants that there was no ``significant relationship'' between
the amount of vitamin C that people ate and their blood-lead
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco
studied data collected from 19,578 participants, ages 6 through 90,
who did not have a history of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The participants had taken part in a national health survey from
1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Co-author of the study, Dr. Joel S. Simon, said that previous
studies have found increased dietary amounts of vitamin C linked
with lower blood-lead levels. He said that his and his colleagues'
inability to find a dietary relationship may have been attributable
to ``imprecise'' questionnaire wording. He also suggested that high
lead levels flush ascorbic acid out of the system more quickly,
lowering the ascorbic acid level in the blood.

   &UR; Ouch-free monitor device promising for diabetics

   Checking the body's blood sugar levels at home could get less
painful for people with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoWatch biographer, an experimental watch-like device, has
been shown to be as effective as current self-monitoring techniques
that require pricking a finger to get blood samples, according to a
report released Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association
meeting in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which is worn on the arm, electrochemically measures
the glucose levels in tiny amounts of fluid found between cells
beneath the skin's surface.
</P>
<P>
   A AAA battery attached to the GlucoWatch releases an electric
current into the skin that enlarges the pores and causes the fluid
to seep out.
</P>
<P>
   When the fluid reacts with an enzyme on a small disposable pad,
a glucose measurement can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The device would allow people with diabetes to check their
glucose levels up to 36 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the readings were nearly identical with those
done by pricking the finger to draw blood.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoWatch awaits US Food and Drug Administration approval, and
is unlikely to be made commercially available for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The device could cost about $300 and the disposable sensor pads
about $4.

 &UR; ADHD report promotes treating with stimulants
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stimulants, such as Ritalin, that are prescribed for youths with
attention-deficit hyperactivitiy disorder may be underprescribed,
according to a new study, and not overprescribed, as suggested by
media reports and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Peter S. Jensen, a child and adolescent
psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, found
that fewer than one in eight children with ADHD were prescribed the
stimulant medications.
</P>
<P>
   It will appear in the July 1999 Journal of the American Academy
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   The results came from a 1992 sample of nearly 1,300 children and
their parents in Atlanta, New Haven, Westchester, N.Y., and San
Juan.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD,
and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated
with stimulant drugs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that ADHD children were generally more likely
to receive other forms of treatment, such as in-school services or
mental health counseling, than medication.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulants are considered the best treatment, according to
Jensen's study. His report acknowledges that there have been
well-documented studies showing that the number of children
receiving stimulants is increasing, although little information is
known as to why that is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   But his report suggests that there are ``many children with ADHD
going unidentified and untreated.''
