 DRUG OK COULD BE A BOON FOR ALZA CORP.  &HT;     By TOM ABATE

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved a one-a-day pill for attention-deficit disorder that is
easier to take and possibly more effective than current three-a-day
versions of the commonly prescribed drug Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View,
Calif.'s Alza Corp., which can now enter the $700 million-a-year
market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ADHD makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and
in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when parents are making the decision
to use or not use ADHD medications,'' said Alza chief executive Dr.
Ernest Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Mario said the company will immediately start promoting its
one-a-day capsule to pediatricians. He said Alza could ship the
first pills out of its Vacaville factory ``in a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alza pill is based on the drug methylphenidate, the generic
version of Ritalin, which has been used since the 1950s to control
ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   For the 3 to 5 percent of schoolchildren, mainly boys, who are
believed to have ADHD, pediatricians routinely prescribe Ritalin or
generic alternatives two or three times a day, generally around
mealtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Novartis, the Swiss drug firm that invented Ritalin,
brought out a sustained-release version in 1984, that single-dose
pill has not been widely used by physicians. Dr. Ami Goodman, a
pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, said doctors
typically prescribe the multiple-dose versions because they think
they work better.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said doctors have been hoping for an effective one-a-day
version because fewer children will forget to take the drug. He
said a one-a-day pill would remove the stigma that attaches to kids
who must slip off to the school nurse's office for a noon booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of trying to keep ADHD a more private affair,''
said Goodman, who had no opinion about whether the new Alza formula
would be any more effective than Novartis' little-used
sustained-release pill.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Glen Elliot, a psychiatrist at the University of
California at San Francisco and an Alza consultant, said the
clinical studies leading up to the FDA's approval suggest that Alza
has found the time-release technology that works.
</P>
<P>
   Alza's secret is the pill itself, which is about the size of a
Tic Tac candy. The pill's outer coating is actually a dose of the
drug, which dissolves quickly and begins circulating through the
child's bloodstream when the pill is taken before or after
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   But it is what is inside the pill that counts. The outer shell
dissolves to reveal a tiny plastic pump filled with a 12-hour dose.
The pump works by osmosis. It absorbs water from the body. The
water liquifies tiny amounts of drug and pushes the liquified drug
out a microscopic hole in the pump at a rate calculated to exhaust
the medicine just as the child is finishing homework.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of an easy-to-use pill is sure to fuel the
debate about whether ADHD is overdiagnosed _ and whether Ritalin or
its generic alternatives are overprescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hinshaw, a psychiatrist at the University of California
at Berkeley and an ADHD specialist, was part of a recent National
Institutes of Health study that endorsed the effectiveness of
Ritalin for controlling ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Hinshaw, who is also an Alza consultant, the problem
is that ADHD can be misdiagnosed in two ways: labeling boys with
the condition simply because they are rambunctious, while missing
girls who may have a form of ADHD that shortens their attention
span without making them unruly in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that you can't evaluate ADHD in 10 minutes, but
in some places that's all the time you get with your physician,''
Hinshaw said.
