   SAN ANTONIO _ A study directed by a physician at the University
of Texas Health Science Center has concluded that a drug called
Adderall might be a better choice for some hyperactive children
than the more widely prescribed Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children in the study took only a single dose of
Adderall daily, and researchers said its overall performance was
better than methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Pliszka, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the University of Texas Health Science Center, was the lead
investigator in the study published this month in the Journal of
the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Funding
for the research came from Shire Richwood Inc., a subsidiary of
Adderall manufacturer Shire Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million children in the United States have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by
symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and
hyperactivity. Stimulant-based medication long has been the primary
treatment for the disorder, and methylphenidate has accounted for
80 percent of the prescriptions written during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Adderall, a mixture of two types of amphetamines, initially was
developed as a weight loss drug in the 1960s and later fell out of
use. The manufacturer revived it several years ago after tests
showed it was effective in treating ADHD. It has been used largely
for children who don't respond to methylphenidate.
</P>
<P>
   Pliszka's study is part of an effort by doctors to compare the
two drugs in controlled tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we can use Adderall first,'' Pliszka said.
``Physicians and families should feel very comfortable about using
it. That's the main finding of this study.''
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 58 children who got Adderall, methylphenidate
or a placebo _ a harmless, unmedicated preparation _ for three
weeks. During that time, the children were evaluated periodically
by teachers and parents, using a scale that assessed whether their
behavior and attention problems were improving.
</P>
<P>
   Pliszka said the research showed both medications were superior
to the placebo and that Adderall performed better than
methylphenidate. Seventy percent of the children on Adderall also
were able to get by on one dose a day, eliminating the need for
midday medication, Pliszka said.
</P>
<P>
   That finding could be an important point for Shire, because new
drugs are entering the marketplace that are designed for once-a-day
dosing. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &AMP; Johnson is seeking federal
approval for its new drug, Concerta, which will offer single-dose
convenience. The company expects to begin marketing the drug later
this year.

<P>
   Ritalin is manufactured by CIBA-Geigy Corp.
