	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of American children take drugs daily  
to calm hyperactivity, but medical science has been uncertain how 
the drugs affect the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet  
hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a 
neurotransmitter, in the brain. A study appears Friday in the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer  
from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
or ADHD. These children are restless and impulsive and have 
difficulty concentrating. Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine have 
a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Duke University  
discovered the serotonin action of Ritalin by eliminating the 
possibility that the drug was acting on other brain chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	They used a laboratory mouse strain that had been genetically  
manipulated to lack a key protein in the processing of dopamine, 
another neurotransmitter. Such mice have symptoms similar to those 
of ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mice lacking normal dopamine were given Ritalin, they  
were calmed, proving that the drug was not acting on dopamine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then blocked the effects of norepinephrine,  
another brain chemical, but this had no effect on the ADHD 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the researchers gave the mice Prozac, a drug that  
inhibits the action of serotonin. The ADHD symptoms declined 
dramatically in the mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, said the researchers, show that Ritalin acts on the  
serotonin levels in the brain by restoring a proper balance between 
serotonin and other natural brain chemicals.
