WORKPLACE: ADAPTING TO ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA LAWLOR

<P>
   In her new job as a recruiter for a telecommunications company
in Herndon, Va., Alicia Dennis was told to sign up for a weeklong
training session. Dennis, who has attention deficit disorder,
promptly panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd never make it through,'' she said. ``It's very
technical information. You're sitting in a lecture with 25 or 30
people looking at black-and-white slide presentations. I wouldn't
be able to concentrate. I'd zone out, and then I'd be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Dennis probably would have forced herself to go to
the seminar, struggled through the classes and returned a nervous
wreck. She might not have even known she suffered from ADD _ or
would have tried to keep it secret if she did know.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. Publicity about ADD and its cousin,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many
people with the disorders more aware of their condition. They also
have new legal protections against job discrimination and access to
new treatments. As a result, they have become much more open about
forming strategies for dealing with the disability on the job.
</P>
<P>
   More of them are also getting advice from personal coaches. The
International Coach Federation says it found in an informal survey
of its members that the number of their clients with ADD had grown
by an average of two-thirds in the last three years. Dennis is one
such client. She told her supervisors about her condition before
going to the training conference last year, and they agreed to let
her take breaks from classes as needed and return later for makeup
sessions. She has since hired a coach, Jodi Sleeper-Triplett, who,
like other career coaches who specialize in attention disorders,
says training can do wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients don't know where to start,'' Sleeper-Triplett said.
``They call me to ask: `How do I figure out what time to get up in
the morning so I can get to the office by 9? How do I set up a
filing system so I can find things?' Managers and co-workers think
the person doesn't care, or is rude. It really is a lack of
knowledge and training.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleeper-Triplett helps them develop systems to be better
organized, like keeping detailed daily planners, setting alarms and
beepers to remind them of appointments and color-coding their
files. She also asks them to send her their to-do lists every day
by e-mail, and she makes sure they have set aside enough time to
complete each task.

   Nancy Ratey, a coach from Wellesley, Mass., who herself has
ADHD, once counseled a doctor with the disorder who had performed
well until his practice was taken over by managed care and he was
forced to see many more patients. Overwhelmed, he took to chaining
his foot to his desk to force himself to dictate revisions in
patients' charts. Still, he fell behind with a backlog of more than
300 charts and was close to losing his job. Ratey advised him to
stand up and move around while he dictated patient notes and to
minimize interruptions by closing his office door and having papers
put in a box outside the office. Within days, he had caught up.
</P>

   Wilma Fellman, a career counselor in Troy, Mich., reports a
similar rescue mission. She was working with a criminal lawyer with
ADD who was crumbling under the strain of juggling several cases at
once. She persuaded him to switch to another specialty, real
estate. ``He needed to work on one thing until he completed it,''
Fellman said. ``This area let him work on a case for a relatively
short period of time and close it. He loved it.''

   Experts say employers have everything to gain from the new
openness about attention disorders, which are biochemical
imbalances in the brain with symptoms that include procrastination,
impulsiveness, disorganization, hyperactivity, lack of motivation
and an inability to manage time. Once considered to afflict only
children, the disorders are now said to have been diagnosed in 3
percent to 5 percent of adults, too. Half are women, who tend to
feel the loss of self-esteem more keenly than men and who are often
shunted into low-level administrative positions for which they are
ill-suited, according to Dr. Kathleen Nadeau, a clinical
psychologist in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Many counselors and other specialists say that in most cases,
little things can make a big difference. Patricia H. Latham, a
lawyer in Washington and co-founder of the National Center for Law
and Learning Disabilities, says ADD sufferers can negotiate minor
accommodations in the workplace without disclosing that they have
the disorder. They can ask for flexible start times, for example,
or the right to close the office door if they are distracted by
noise.

   Nessa Miller, 40, an operations specialist for the Social
Security Administration in Baltimore, decided to tell her employer
of her ADHD diagnosis to help explain why she had temper tantrums
so severe that she sometimes put her fists through walls. Her boss
granted her extra breaks so she could get up from her desk and walk
around for several minutes once an hour, and he began sending her
memos with widely spaced paragraphs following up and summarizing
his spoken instructions. Now, she says, she has learned to have a
sense of humor about her condition. ``You have to learn it's not
your fault,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If fine-tuning the office routine does not work, specialists
say, people with the disorders might want to think about switching
careers. They tend to adapt well to jobs that require a lot of
action, give immediate feedback and have clear deadlines, like
sales, teaching, coaching sports, journalism, police work and
acting, the specialists say. But they can become frustrated in jobs
that require great attention to detail or sitting at a desk all
day. ``Because ADD people have trouble motivating themselves, they
use external deadlines like Damocles' sword,'' said Dr. Barry
Garfinkel, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the simple act of finding that the discomfort of a
lifetime has a name is enough to start on the path to recovery.
``All my life I was a bad person,'' said John Schumacher, 53, a
chef and hotel owner in New Prague, Minn. ``My nickname in school
was Johnny Nothing. I was so frustrated, so ashamed, I'd put my
head in my desk and cry.'' That changed after he was told that he
had ADHD and was treated with medication. ``I have a whole new
world,'' he said. ``I'm excited about life.''
