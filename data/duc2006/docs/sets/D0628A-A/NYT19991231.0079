DISCOVERING A DEFICIT OF ATTENTION DEFICIT 
</HEADLINE>

   Experts estimate that 1.5 million to 2.4 million (or 3 percent
to 5 percent) of schoolchildren in the United States have
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. And tens of thousands are
regularly given drugs like Ritalin to combat it. But in Britain the
diagnosis is made for fewer than 1 percent of the schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jacobson, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, decided to investigate why.
He says he believes his is the first cross-cultural study of the
disorder. His findings are sure to contribute to debate over
whether attention deficit disorder is the result of biology, as
most experts now believe, or the creation of a society addicted to
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Examining 10- and 11-year-olds in Oxfordshire and in western
Massachusetts, Jacobson found that there was little difference
between the behavior of children in whom the disorder is diagnosed
and those found to be normal. Both groups surpassed the average for
inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including
restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not
listening and fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The default condition that children will revert to is ADHD,''
Jacobson concluded. Though he holds master's degrees in
neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that
the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain
or abnormal glucose metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are inclined to diagnose a child as ADHD,'' he said,
``you have ample opportunity. And if you are inclined not to
diagnose a child, you also have ample opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of identifying the disorder has been recognized
for years. In 1998 a panel of experts commissioned by the National
Institutes of Health found that a consistent diagnostic method for
the disorder had proved elusive. In December, a landmark study by
the national institutes on treatment of the disorder found that the
drug Ritalin was more effective than behavioral-modification
therapy, which is what is primarily used in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might use Jacobson's preliminary findings, which he
presented at the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New
Mexico in September and again at the American Anthropological
Association in Chicago in November, to conclude that the disorder
is simply widely underdiagnosed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson recognizes this and says he has to do more work on why
the British rate is so low. But he is convinced by his study, which
should be completed in the spring, that the direct connection made
between attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities is
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something else is the cause of the problem that kids
don't learn up to level that they are being compared to,'' he said.
``All children have talents, and all children have needs. What we
are doing by focusing on ADHD is focusing on a few kids' needs. So
we have a whole group of kids who have special needs and are not
getting attention.''
