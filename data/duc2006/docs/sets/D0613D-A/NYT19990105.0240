NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN FACING THE BIG 3-0

<P>
   Generation X _ that youthful, ``slacker'' generation _ is facing
a quiet crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of that group is turning 30. Time to grow up,
get serious. Time for a major identity shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as not really that together and not
really very grown up,'' said Kristin Beck, a Bay-area writer who
hit the big 3-0 last April.
</P>
<P>
   After reading up on adult development, she and colleague Lauren
Dockett interviewed more than 30 women about ``lessons learned and
dreams examined'' as they reached their first scary ``decade''
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The responses are woven into their book, ``Facing 30: Women Talk
About Constructing a Real Life and Other Scary Rites of Passage''
(New Harbinger Publications, 163 pages, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Beck and Dockett uncovered rampant angst among their peers, who
believed they had little to show for themselves as they entered
serious adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering in school, putting off marriage, flitting from job to
job, they panicked as they saw their adolescence stretch like cheap
pantyhose. Many worried they were living a kind of ``adulthood
lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women pretty uniformly said their identity was shaken at the
end of their 20s,'' Beck said. ``Love and career and babies: Those
are the big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women believed self-imposed deadline pressure to have their
lives tidily arranged _ right now. When things didn't gel, they
believed the problem lay with them, not their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest unrealistic expectation,'' Beck said, ``is
that you have to achieve everything by 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Graying baby boomers may snort at the thought of Gen-Xers
wringing their smooth, unlined hands over the trauma of aging, but
Beck says ix-nay on the condescension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you're facing 50, 30 looks pretty good,'' she
concedes. ``But like it or not, it is a significant developmental
period in a woman's life. If you don't take a look at stuff in your
30s, you might end up with a big, fat midlife crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen-Xers grew up in a different climate than their elders, so
turning 30 feels slightly different for them. Baby boomers _ who
coined the phrase, ``Don't trust anyone over 30'' _ may have
suffered some chagrin when age pushed them into the enemy camp. But
their choices in life were fairly straightforward, Beck said. They
could either conform to traditional roles or rebel against them.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X, on the other hand, is coming of age with no clear
sense of identity. Everything is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there aren't even rules to be broken,'' Beck said. ``It's
so free-form, it's stultifying.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees Gen-X as a cautious, media-saturated bunch who grew up
without illusions. Stung by their parents' divorces, the women she
met are nervous about commitment, even if they see marriage as a
desirable goal. With far less job security than their parents had,
they view career choice as something malleable, less defining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically our generation in a nutshell _ many, many
different kinds of jobs before settling into a career,'' Beck said.
``The idea is grab what you can get. We have grown up in a pretty
screwy economy and nothing seems very secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women are having babies later in life, they still feel
pressure to get moving on the issue _ at least make up their minds
_ by age 30, Beck said. If they want children, their tendency is to
dump lackluster relationships at around this age and start scouting
for more promising, long-term partners.
</P>
<P>
   Beck senses a backlash against the mantra that women can have it
all _ high-octane career, marriage and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really grateful to our mothers for paving the way for
us,'' she said, ``but I do think that having it all means you're
sacrificing something.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women we talked to wanted to stay home with their
kids _ wanted to _ and considered themselves feminists.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who grew up as a latchkey kid, said she works full time
out of economic necessity but would rather be home with her
2{-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of women are trying to figure out a way to work
half-time and keep themselves in the career loop and pay attention
to their kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger women Beck interviewed saw 30 as a great divide
between the carefree, adventurous possibilities of youth and the
drudgery of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People basically thought you'd be set in your ways, you'd be
calcified, you'd have to give up facets of your personality you
weren't ready to give up,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, turning 30 seldom lived down to their expectations.
Women who had already passed that milestone said they felt more
sure-footed and fully formed. They also felt less pressure to
strive for impossible standards of beauty. Beck said their
philosophy was, ``No one's going to ever buy you as a young person
anymore, so you might as well give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-age women said it's OK to hit 30 without all the answers.
In hindsight, they saw it as a jumping-off point for adulthood _ a
time to move forward with greater confidence and really start
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know yourself better when you turn 30,'' Beck said,
adding that she learned to lighten up after talking to these women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to wrap things up right this second,'' she
decided. ``If I'm not happy in my career, I have a whole lifetime
to figure it out. I don't feel I have to have everything solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she added, ``30 seems like an exciting possibility instead
of a big bummer.''
