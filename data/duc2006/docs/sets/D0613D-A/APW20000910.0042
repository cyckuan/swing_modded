<HEADLINE> Rabbi's Internet search prompts book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting
discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, who leads Stamford's conservative Jewish
congregation, Temple Beth El, tried a search by typing in ''God.''
</P>
<P>
   The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild
for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking
God in Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the
Internet to find faith. He's concluded that younger generations are
not rejecting God but understanding him in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to
religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions
use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,''
Hammerman said.
</P>
<P>
   While many young people don't set foot in a church, synagogue or
mosque, they may be more likely to discuss religion in a chat room
or surf for Web sites where they can learn about different
religions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of
congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,''
Hammerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people are identifying God with the concept of the
World Wide Web, ''that God seems to be within and between us,
rather than above us.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey found that 75 percent of Internet users have
engaged Web searches with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is sometimes viewed as an alienating force, driving
surfers into an artificial world and away from real human contact.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, unlike many mainstream religious leaders, views the
Internet as a vessel for improved communication between people,
with the power to ''connect us in ways we've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some churches and congregations, including Hammerman's, have Web
sites. In the future, prayer services will probably be available
online, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman has even married a couple who met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is something real happening in the virtual
world,'' he said. ''The word 'religion,' in Latin, actually means
'reconnect.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The book is supplemented by a Web site, aptly addressed,
thelordismyshepherd.com, where surfers can read about the book and
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, 43, has led Temple Beth El for 13 years. He was
formerly the first pulpit rabbi to be president of The Council of
Churches &AMP; Synagogues of Southwestern Connecticut.
