SINGING THE PRAISES OF A RESURGENT PEACE CORPS

   The fairly widespread notion that America's young adults at
century's end are navel-gazing, latte-scarfing me-firsters is
bogus, says Mark Gearan.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. As director of the Peace Corps for 3 1/2 years,
he's shoveled thousands of Peace Corps volunteers off to the
backwaters of the planet. These are not plush Club Med vacations,
but two-year commitments, often in the Back of Beyond, to work with
folks at ground level who usually have little in the way of tools
but their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fall we'll have 7,400 volunteers abroad _ that's the
highest number in 25 years. Right now we have 6,700 in 80 different
countries. We're making a big push to get up to 10,000 volunteers.
So for those who paint the young people of `Gen X' or `Gen Y' as
slackers, we don't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, does the Congress, which two weeks ago approved
money to expand the Peace Corps, a rare show of bipartisan support
for a Clinton initiative. Flying to Boston first thing on the
morning after the White House St. Patrick's Day bash, Gearan, the
Gardner native who was deputy chief of staff and White House
communications director in Clinton's first term, clicked off his
agency's growth rings: ``Four years ago we had 100,000 inquiries a
year. Last year we had 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in Symphony Hall, the Handel &AMP; Haydn Society of
Boston and New Heritage Music Foundation will present ``Celebrating
the Voice of Peace,'' to commemorate the Peace Corps's founding 38
years ago by President Kennedy. David McCullough, the author and
PBS broadcaster, will narrate from writings of JFK and his favorite
poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying the pianist gets sick,'' cracked Gearan, a saloon
piano player of some note. The Handel &AMP; Haydn Society approached
him two years ago about celebrating Kennedy's Peace Corps scheme,
he said. The oratorio composed by Dan Welcher is the first work
commissioned by the Society in 20 years. There will be a 3 p.m.
Symphony Hall matinee performance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   From its creation in 1961, the first year of JFK's 1,000-day
presidency, the Peace Corps was a beacon of optimism and
neighborliness that has served the country well. So far 152,000
Americans volunteered for short money and long hours in remote
spots which needed a school, a well, a Ground Zero health program.
There are 38 American volunteers who'll rendevous in Symphony Hall
and fly out Saturday to Senegal in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly the same sense of travel and adventure in
today's volunteers that we've had since '61,'' said Gearan, ``but
now they're getting their experience in the global economy.''
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is a Peace Corps
alum, as are Senator Chris Dodd and five congressmen, three of them
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the $30,000 to $50,000 college bonuses the military uses
to lure high school-graduating recruits in this
almost-full-employment age, the Peace Corps's applicant pool is
average age 28, almost all of them recent college graduates. Once
selected, they get a get a modest monthly stipend to live on, plus
full health insurance, and deferments on college loans, if any. On
completing their two-year stint, they get a readjustment allowance
of $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan in the past month was in Africa and Latin America with
Clinton. ``In Tanzania I sat with Charlie Stith (the Boston
minister who is US ambassador there) and the Tanzanian prime
minister, who said the first American he ever met was his Peace
Corps teacher. You hear that all over Africa and the Third World.''
But not all idealists are young people. One volunteer out of 12 is
over age 50. Massachusetts furnishes more volunteers than all but
four other states, said Gearan. Among the top 25 colleges feeding
the Peace Corps are UMass, Tufts, Smith, Williams, BU, and Gearan's
alma mater, Harvard (he is class of '78).
</P>
<P>
   Gearan started a new Crisis Corps, to recruit former volunteers
to go back for short stays to countries hit by natural disaster or
humanitarian crises. ``In Honduras on the last trip, we have one
guy who's an engineer on the Central Artery project here. He's
taking two months to go back to Honduras to help out after
Hurricane Mitch. He's a perfect example of a guy who's been there;
he can go in and literally on Day One be ready to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate efforts are made to furnish volunteers with training,
language skills, and medical precautions. Not one volunteer has
been kidnapped, and ``safety and security are our No. 1 priority.''
In-house surveys show a high level of volunteer satisfaction,
Gearan said. ``Nine out of ten would volunteer again, and the same
proportion would recommend it to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Corps remains Kennedy's enduring governmental
monument. It made JFK into a worldwide figure of inspiration, the
most popular American abroad before Muhammed Ali, the all-time
popularity champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in countries today which did not exist when the Peace
Corps started,'' said Gearan, ``And we're in countries today where
you couldn't get a visa as an American.''
