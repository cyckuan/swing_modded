<HEADLINE> Nissan Launches Xterra SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- Nissan launched its new Xterra sport  
utility vehicle Monday, but it didn't simply roll off an assembly 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Covered in mud, a silver Xterra drove out of a smoking 20-foot  
backpack to the throbbing beat of loud music as hundreds of Smyrna 
plant workers wearing ``Xterra looks good dirty'' T-shirts cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how a real SUV should look,'' said Jerry Benefield,  
Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials hope the Xterra (pronounced ehks-TEH'-ruh),  
Nissan's first totally new product since the Altima in 1992, will 
help the troubled carmaker boost sales by attracting active, young 
outdoor enthusiasts. The name is intended to link images of 
Generation X and rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	This SUV will not have leather seats, but there is an option for  
neoprene covers, which could be useful to surfers or scuba divers 
who climb in while wet. The Xterra has room in the back for two 
mountain bikes to be placed in vertically, and mounts to hold them. 
</P>
<P>
	The optional roof rack can be fitted to hold snowboards, skis,  
canoes, kayaks and bikes. And the Xterra has a ``backpack'' on its 
rear, accessible with the tailgate lifted, to hold a first-aid kit 
or other gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xterra goes on sale in early June, priced between  
$17,500-$25,000. Most buyers are expected to take the two-wheel 
drive version with a V-6 engine, manual transmission and air -- 
costing about $18,500, Nissan spokesman Jason Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan plans to make at least 60,000 Xterras the first year,  
with top production capability at the plant of about 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Xterra, Nissan is also counting on the  
redesigned Maxima and the Frontier Crew Cab truck to help turn the 
Japanese automaker around. Last week, Nissan executives said they 
expected a $296.6 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which recently entered a partnership with Renault  
SA of France in order to get a $5.4 billion cash infusion, plans to 
drop production and slash 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan North American president Minoru Nakamura said sales  
on this continent are expected to increase from around 630,000 
Nissan and Infiniti vehicles to 700,000 for the 1999 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Xterra should bring ``good showroom traffic'' that  
helps boost the sale of other Nissan vehicles, similar to what 
happened when Volkswagen began selling its new Beetle.
