   Slackers and Generation X types, it seems, are hardly slack when
it comes to saving for retirement. According to a recent survey,
people between the ages of 18 and 39 began saving for retirement at
an average age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far earlier starting age than for older groups, the
survey found: People between the ages of 40 and 64 began saving for
retirement at an average age of 35, and those 65 and older waited
until they were 46. Louis Harris &AMP; Associates surveyed 1,000 adults
in June for Alliance Capital Management, the money management firm
in New York.

   But young savers, who can generally afford to invest most
aggressively because they don't need the money for many years, are
proving oddly conservative in investment choices. The poll found
that only 46 percent of people aged 18 to 29 were using stocks or
stock or bond funds in their retirement investing. And young
investors who do own stocks or funds devote only 35 percent of
their portfolios to them, on average.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 62 percent of those aged 30 to 49 have invested
money in stocks or mutual funds. And these people are putting a
greater portion of their money _ 51 percent _ into such
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 56 percent of those aged 50 to 64
held stocks or mutual funds; on average, these investors also
devoted 51 percent of their portfolios to them.

   ``We were fascinated that Gen X-ers would start saving regularly
for retirement earlier than their elders did but keep less of their
assets in more aggressive investments,'' said John Carifa,
president of Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that retirement savers didn't think they
were stashing away enough money. In estimating how much money they
would need to retire with an income equal to 70 percent of what
they now earned, the respondents gave a median answer of $196,000.
But the median amount they actually expected to save was just
$143,000, a 27 percent shortfall.
