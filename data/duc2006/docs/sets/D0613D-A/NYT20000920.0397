   TRENTON, Ohio _ In a time when the nation's public schools are
devoid of organized prayer, millions of students, teachers and
parents bowed their heads Wednesday morning commemorating the
annual ``See You at the Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered
at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with
their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand''
just before the start of the school day.
</P>
<P>
   The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as
for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help
everybody be a witness for God.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere. You got to pray
everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new
legislation that bans open religious expression during
extracurricular activities including sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took
away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
``I thought that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This event allows us to keep (children) focused upon God,''
said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away. ``He
is the answer to all of our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event
allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to freely practice your faith. That is the
foremost amendment in the Bill of Rights. I think it's important
for us to do that here at school. This is lawful. This is what the
courts say we are allowed to do,'' Mignery said. ``I think the
reason we are losing many of our rights is because may of us aren't
exercising our rights today.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``See You at the Pole'' Website, the event
draws more than 3 million participants each year. The site said the
event is student initiated and came out of the desire of `` a small
group of teen-agers'' from Burleson, Texas, in 1990.
