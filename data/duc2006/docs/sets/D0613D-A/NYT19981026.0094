 &HT;    Generations at war over economic pie

<P>
   This week, when astronaut John Glenn straps himself into the
shuttle Discovery, younger Americans will marvel at the
achievements of this 77-year-old hero.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a combat pilot, space pioneer, political leader and
family man. He embodies the best about his gritty generation, the
one that triumphed in World War II and then built the world's
greatest economy.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the glowing descriptions you'll hear from young TV
reporters lead you to believe that goodwill toward older Americans
is universal. Despite the family ties that bind us, the different
generations seem to be growing apart as jealousy and economic
conflict drive wedges between the various age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Glenn's generation believe they are losing
ground financially now. At the same time, their children are
getting sick of paying high taxes to support Social Security. And
Generation Xers are afraid the baby boomers ahead of them soon will
create such a huge voting bloc of retirees that Congress will be
pushed to further boost taxes to support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation has some legitimate gripes and fears. Today's
over-65 Americans are frustrated because they are seeing their
income decline at a time when younger people are flourishing. While
jobs are plentiful and mortgages cheap for workers in the prime of
life, retirees are getting pinched by a meager 1.3 percent
cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments and a
continuing decline in the interest rates paid on savings.
</P>
<P>
   With their incomes stagnant or shrinking, many older Americans
are getting angry with their children. They resent seeing younger
generations buying bigger homes and cars. ``I've never known a more
self-indulgent, self-absorbed, self-centered generation as the baby
boomers,'' one reader said in a recent letter to me.
</P>
<P>
   A jealous 69-year-old parent wrote: ``My first home had 1,200
square feet. My daughter's home today is over 3,000, as are most of
the homes being built in north Fulton, where I still have a tiny,
one-story ranch home with wood siding.''
</P>
<P>
   But while senior citizens are complaining about ``selfish''
children, boomers are getting fed up with the kvetching of their
parents, who are getting far more out of Social Security than they
put into it. In the 1950s, the combined payroll tax for Social
Security, paid by both workers and their employers, was just 6
percent. Today, the combined tax is 12.4 percent. The World War II
generation had nowhere near the tax burden that today's workers
carry to fund benefits for aging veterans, Social Security,
Medicare and other programs for the elderly. Largely because of
that government aid, the elderly are the wealthiest demographic
group in America.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no generation has more to fear from their elders
than Generation X, the people born from the mid-1960s to the late
1970s. Those young workers are vastly outnumbered by the boomers
who were born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   GenXers may find themselves suffocated by much higher taxes to
care for long-living boomers. Economists estimate that to maintain
today's level of Social Security benefits, workers in 2020 will
have to shoulder a 20 percent payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Congress is supposed to take up Social Security reform.
The arguments could get very ugly as each generation tries to cut a
better deal for itself. For decades, the most bitter battles in
American social and political life were over race. In coming years,
the most hostile debates may be over what one generation owes
another.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions around the table at Thanksgiving may get a lot
livelier in the next century.
