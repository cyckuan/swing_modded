GOODWILL STORES HAVE BECOME HIP SHOPPING DESTINATIONS FOR GEN-XERS

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ We can assume that the Rev. Edgar Helms of
Boston _ who, in 1910, founded what would become Goodwill
Industries _ was not hip. Neither was the good reverend, most
likely, groovy. He certainly didn't know that gray would become the
new black.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has
come to consider the retail stores. Due in part to Generation X's
preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s (and '80s and
even early '90s, it seems) and thanks to image-building efforts
from the organization itself, Goodwill isn't just for people with
``special needs'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool,'' says local
twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe. ``I've been going there for
about a decade. My shopping technique, wherever I've lived, is to
find the poorest neighborhood and to go there. You avoid places
where hipsters go because they'll sift through everything and get
the good stuff. They won't go to the poor neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Goodwillers, McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite
find. ``It was an early '70s-era purple, shiny three-piece suit,
with, like, huge lapels. It had a sheen to it,'' he says. ``I paid
about $1.50 or $2. But I gave it to a friend because it looked
better on him. He had an Afro.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe does admit to having ``special needs,'' but not the sort
that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century. The
nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund
community-based training and job-placement programs for people who
otherwise might slip through the cracks. Last year, Goodwill
Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job
placement and sold nearly $690 million in donated goods.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Quillian, the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of
Fort Worth, says her organization got its groove back by focusing
on retail display in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image
and the way we present ourselves,'' she says. ``We're not what
people typically think a thrift store is. It's surprising to a lot
of people, when they first come in, that we look just like any
other store.''
</P>
<P>
   Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit
store managers who have retail experience, people who ``really know
how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it.''
Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard's before
coming to Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that
bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its
well-displayed racks, but that the decidedly downscale shop founded
by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale
fashion. Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design
firm William Reid.
</P>
<P>
   William Reid's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley
Korshak, Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue. Reid is so hip that
sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good
idea. And, as it turns out, he shops Goodwill for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a fashion library,'' Reid says. ``I go in
there just looking for things that are very unusual, whether it's
details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you can't explain to
someone. We find a lot of old ties, and we'll take a pattern of
that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit
and make it into shirts and all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial
splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy. Only a few
weeks ago, he bought a jacket for $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around
the cuff,'' he remembers fondly. ``It was so unusual. We
immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said, `How
difficult is it to do this?' They laughed and said they couldn't
touch it. The machinery to do some of those things just isn't
around anymore.''
