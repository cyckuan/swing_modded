 &HT;    First auto designated a 2000 likely to be a Neon

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first automobile to carry the year 2000 on its
registration papers is likely to be the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth
Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have announced 2000-model-year products, but
with the first 2000 Neons being shipped to retailers this month,
the DaimlerChrysler-built compact should go down in the record
books as the first 2000 to take to the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in '94 to target the Generation X market segment, Neon
now claims to be ``grown up but not old.''
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $12,890, Neon boasts about its roominess,
affordability, fun and refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Neon has included as standard those options most frequently
ordered in the past. ``D'' package buyers will get AM/FM/cassette
with six speakers, four cup holders, a 60/40 fold-down split rear
seat, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, visor vanity mirror,
floor mats and a trunk light.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional $1,760, ``G'' package purchasers get remote
keyless entry, theft alarm, tilt steering, cruise control, power
windows and door locks, and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control and alloy
wheels are also offered.
</P>
<P>
   Cab-forward design
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Neon shares the cab-forward design pioneered by
Chrysler. A new rear-end and taillamp treatment along with more
prominent wheel arches add to a more substantial appearance.
Finally, the Neon gets full-framed doors that increase body
stiffness, improve window fit and reduce wind noise.
</P>
<P>
   On the performance side, Neon has a 132-horsepower 2.0-liter
engine. A manual gearbox remains standard with an automatic
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the new ``refined'' exterior, taupe has been added
as an interior color choice, but gone are the lizard greens, chrome
yellows and periwinkle purple exterior colors of the original Neon.
Exterior colors include metallic silvers, garnet and jade.
