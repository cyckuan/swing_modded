<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the day you've either been dreading or, perhaps, secretly
awaiting _ the day your baby graduates from high school and leaves
home or maybe comes home again after college. But whether you're
weeping with joy or despair, the gift you give is a great way of
showing your grad how well you understand his or her angst and
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Youth Intelligence recently asked more than 1,000 high school
and college seniors what they'd like for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the most common requests were for the newest
technology, but there were still a few desired items that don't
need a manual. Here are some of the hottest gifts on the Gen-X hit
list.
</P>
<P>
   PORTABLE DVD PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 requested gift (other than cash) was a portable DVD
player. Portable DVD players run on batteries and can go anywhere.
I've even seen people in New York City walking down the street
watching a movie. At a list price of approximately $1,000, this is
a costly purchase, but one I know your grad will love.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL CAMERA
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to capturing graduation memories, today's seniors
won't settle for old-fashioned photos. More than 65 percent of the
respondents we surveyed wanted a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   While most adults can't turn one on, the next generations can
have a picture cropped, re-colored and e-mailed to their classmates
before you say cheese. Plan to spend between $300 and $1,500 to
make your grad happy.
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE PHONE
</P>
<P>
   Whether your grad is switching apartments, traveling or just
avoiding the prying eyes of parents, Gen X considers the personal
phone a necessity. Although Nokia ruled the roost with ther sleek,
silver version, Motorola's V series, just out a few months and
priced at around $500, is gaining steam. Hipsters in Los Angeles
and New York carry them, and grads crave the streamlined size and
Internet access. Before you buy any phone, make sure that your
grad's phone carrier can use it _ though if a particular model is a
``must have,'' your grad may prefer to switch carriers.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTY KICKS (shoes, that is)
</P>
<P>
   Air Prestos are the coolest shoes in town. When I recently wore
a pair to a high school in Los Angeles, I was mobbed by teens who
wanted them, and one offered me twice the retail price ($85). Nike
is a trailblazer once again. These athletic shoes weigh almost
nothing (which makes them easy to pack) but provide support and
comfort (which suits the adventurous athlete). It doesn't hurt that
they come in a dazzling array of colors.
</P>
<P>
   CHARM BRACELET
</P>
<P>
   You might have purchased one of these for your daughter on her
fifth birthday and you'd swear she misplaced it by her seventh.
Chances are you'll soon see it emerge from the depths of her
dresser. Charm bracelets are back big time. Young people hunger for
some of the things that previously brought them comfort. In
addition, charms provide ultimate individualization. Each one tells
a story.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALIZED STATIONERY
</P>
<P>
   In a world of technology and gadgets, instant messaging and
e-mails, young people are telling me that when it really counts,
they'd rather write a letter. Elaborate papers (translucent, in
unique shapes or with pressed flowers,) help them feel that they're
sending something special.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later your grad will head to the beach and this is a
great way to buy a gift that isn't too expensive. Of course stylish
sunners won't settle for plain old beach towels (so pre-senior).
Instead, they have their eyes on a beach mat. The most coveted are
from a company called Inca (I saw some hot versions at Fred Segal
in Santa Monica a couple of weeks ago), which also have matching
straw bags. When it comes to sunglasses, you can't go wrong with
aviators. The coolest ones are from Stussy and Chloe, but XOXO
offers a less expensive version. The hippest lenses are burgundy,
but make sure they have strong UVA/UVB protection as often the
tinted lenses don't provide it.
</P>
<P>
   CYBER MONEY
</P>
<P>
   If you still don't know what to get, let your grad decide. Buy
some online money from CyberMoola.com, Flooze.com or
Internetcash.com. Each of these sites has multiple online stores
from which the recipient can choose.
