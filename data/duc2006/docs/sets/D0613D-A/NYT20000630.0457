 &HT;    Young political enthusiasts are bringing new zest into
Democratic and Republican organizations

   DAYTON, Ohio _ When scores of the state's behind-the-scenes
politicos showed up in Columbus last month to schmooze at the
annual Ohio Board of Elections Association conference, the
Montgomery County contingent stood out like a Brownie troop at a
senior citizens ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go into these hospitality suites and people would
look at us and say, `What's going on in Montgomery County? These
people are so young,' '' said Nan Whaley, who at age 24 is both
executive director of the county's Democratic Party and a member of
the local Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Whaley at the convention was her mirror image in
Montgomery County politics _ 27-year-old John Shaw, the executive
director of the local Republican Party _ who, like Whaley, holds a
patronage job as a member of the election board.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the two young party execs is a growing cadre of
20-something and early 30-something political workers who are
giving the lie _ at least in the Dayton area _ to the notion that
Generation X is a bunch of slackers who would rather whine about
societal problems than fix them.
</P>
<P>
   The youth infusion has meant ``more pep and vigor in the party
in the last three to four years than in a long time,'' said James
E.P. ``Sully'' Sullivan, 79, a longtime local Democratic Party
player and a former director of the Montgomery County Board of
Elections.
</P>
<P>
   In typical partisan fashion, the two parties each claim to be
the Pied Piper of the local youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 100 Young Democrats in Montgomery County. They
have three Young Republicans,'' Whaley sniffed. ``There is no
organized Young Republicans in Montgomery County.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw begged to differ. The Democrats ``may have a stronger
organization, but we have just as many strong young people'' in the
local Republican ranks. ``Just going to club meetings doesn't mean
you're active.''
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING THE YOUNG
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman said he
got the ball rolling across the generations here in 1996, soon
after the overthrow of former chairman Joe Shump and the old
Democratic guard, by resurrecting the College Democrats Club at the
University of Dayton. The club's growing membership was then
invited to join the county Young Democrats and put to work within
the local party structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word got out that we cared about young people and that we
tried to get them involved in things,'' Lieberman said. ``As a
result, we got lucky and ended up with some very good young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The list includes Whaley; Charlie Bowling, 29, who helped
rebuild the Young Democrat organization here; Troy Singer, 34, who
ran Tony Hill's top vote-getting campaign last fall for the Dayton
school board; and Hill himself, 31, who started out as an adviser
to U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, R-Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican
Party, says local Republicans have done their own trolling for
youth, primarily by changing the way the party recruits and
promotes its workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer who you know, or how long you've paid party dues,
Jacobson said. Now it's what you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started recruiting young people right out of college that
we think have talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican kiddie list now includes Shaw; Chris Heizer, 27,
director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections and vice
president of the local Republican Party executive committee; Doug
Tully, 29, supervisor of the Board of Elections and a member of the
local Republican committee; and Jon Husted, 32, who is running for
the 41st District seat in the Ohio House of Representatives being
vacated by J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   FROM ENVELOPE-STUFFING TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while the Democrats tend to talk about the
youthful vision and energy that Generation X has brought to party
politics, Republicans are more likely to tout their technical and
organizational skills.
</P>
<P>
   Menial tasks such as typing addresses, stuffing envelopes and
tallying votes used to be the drudgery that greased the political
machine, They were often assigned to armies of senior citizens with
plenty of time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all done by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get bright young people who can take apart a computer
and put it back together again,'' said Susan Finley, co-chair of
the Montgomery County Republican Party who also sits on the Board
of Elections. At age 68, Finley calls herself the ``house mother''
of the local election board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Mitchell, author of ``Generation X: The Young Adult
Market'' (New Strategist, $69.95), said it's unusual for Dayton to
have so many young people involved in local politics, especially
party politics. ``The thing that is most striking about this
generation is that they tend not to identify with any political
party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The young pols in both parties worry that too many of their
peers continue to be alienated from the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just immaturity,'' Singer said. ``As we grow
older, we become more aware of how people in office can affect our
paychecks because of taxes that are taken out, how they can affect
the economy and jobs that are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Evans, a 19-year-old member of UD's Young Democrats, says
many of her classmates are apathetic about the political scene
because they are confident that good jobs are waiting for them
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people my age feel very comfortable, almost
complacent,'' Evans said. ``But how long is this (prosperity) going
to last?''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley says that for many Gen-Xers, the bad times are already
here, but younger voters aren't getting the message. ``Most of my
generation is underemployed and don't have good (employee)
benefits. But they don't equate that with the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS OFTEN RUNS IN THE BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   The Gen-Xers involved in local politics most often credited
their families for their interest in political careers.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley cites the inspiration of her mother, who also was active
as a Young Democrat and who later ran for a number of local and
state offices in Indiana, including state auditor. Her mother most
recently won election as clerk-treasurer of Mooresville, Ind., in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's uncle, Enos Singer, was a past president of the Ohio
Board of Elections Association and a longtime veteran of statehouse
politics. His grandfather, Kenneth Singer, was a trustee for many
years in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For others, national leaders provided the inspiration to enter
politics. ``My first interest started with Ronald Reagan . . .
because he made us proud to be Americans again,'' Shaw said. ``I've
been reading presidential biographies ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democrat and Republican youth squads concurred that
Montgomery County's evenly divided vote, and often hotly contested
races, is the challenge that drew them into local party politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have plenty of opportunities to work in Columbus
or (Washington) D.C., but Dayton is fun,'' Whaley said. ``It's the
number one swing county (for elections) in the state. Every race is
a real fight here. People can win on 400 votes out of 50,000
cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw agreed. ``It's an exciting county. Franklin and Hamilton
are mostly Republican. Toledo and Cleveland are mostly Democrat.
But this is just a good 50/50 county with a lot of contested
races.''
</P>
<P>
   They may teasingly call each other R's and D's, but the young
politicos here insist the rivalry only brings them closer socially.
</P>
<P>
   On election night last year, the kiddie corps from both parties
went out to celebrate together. ``Do we argue? Oh yeah,'' Shaw
said. ``But it's all in fun. Nobody ever gets upset about it
because we all know where everybody is coming from before we get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gen-Xers shy away from politics, Shaw puts at least part of
the blame on the system itself. ``I think, frankly, they want to
see more candidates their own age to relate to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH WAS'
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the young pols here have been content to work
behind the scenes as campaign workers, strategists and committee
members. But many are itching to run for office and some, like
31-year-old Tony Hill, already have.
</P>
<P>
   After serving for several years as a campaign worker for other
local candidates, Hill ran for Dayton school board last fall and
nabbed the most votes in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be one of those who just complained about
things going wrong,'' he said. ``I kind of put my money where my
mouth was.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, the younger generation is blamed for not being
engaged in politics ``when the real problem is that the political
system has failed to engage them,'' said Gen-X expert Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people do things out of a civic obligation _ you vote
because you're supposed to,'' she said. ``But younger people aren't
going to vote because of that. You have to give them something to
vote for, give them something to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Term limits may help create some of that excitement in the
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be there for 10 years before getting into a
position of standing, because everyone is limited to eight years
anyway,'' said Husted, citing one of the reasons he decided to run
for Mottley's vacated seat.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said political leaders can't wait too long before
unleashing other Gen-X candidates, or they'll lose young voters
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to start looking at our generation _ not
just on the school board, but to serve downtown on the (city)
commission and in the statehouse as well,'' he said. ``I think we
have some outstanding young people in the city. We need to make
sure we're growing these people for elections down the road.''
