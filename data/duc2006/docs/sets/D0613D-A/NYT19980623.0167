   Was TJ Maxx trying to promote a more youthful corporate culture
when a young manager at a New Jersey store fired several employees
over 40?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Sherry Lang, spokeswoman for TJX Cos. in Framingham,
Mass., and her response is an emphatic ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By policy, this company does not discriminate against anyone
for any reason,'' says Lang. ``We believe their claims have no
merit, none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission last fall alleges TJX Cos., parent of the retail chain,
had exposed older employees to unfair discipline since August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the case centers around 59-year-old Betty Heyner, a
former sales clerk who claims she was railroaded out of her job
back in 1995 because of her age. Heyner is alleging that many of
the problems she experienced while running the jewelry counter at a
suburban New Jersey store stemmed from a young supervisor's brash
managerial style and unorthodox work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Heyner's former manager could not be reached by telephone to
comment. But if allegations in the case illustrate anything at all,
it is that tensions between Generation Xers and senior employees
are not uncommon, and when younger managers are in charge of older
workers emotions are apt to heighten.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 45 million Generation Xers, born between 1965 and
1977. Self-starters who would rather be in the driver's seat than
wait their turn, many twentysomethings are now moving into coveted
managerial positions, jobs baby boomers waited years to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Xers are really the forerunners of a new career
paradigm, and they think of themselves as free agents,'' says Bruce
Tulgan, founder of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven consulting firm
that helps companies better understand this generation. ``They move
into positions of power quickly because they don't do things the
old way, and many are really trying to be the kind of manager they
wanted to have.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of manager is that? Managers who sidestep rules that
get in the way. Managers who aren't afraid to take chances. Not
surprising, baby boomer employees often describe these new managers
as brash, audacious, arrogant, and, yes, a bit threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older workers often feel that companies are looking for
younger people, that they can bring in people who are younger on a
temporary basis and not pay benefits,'' says psychologist Bruce
Cedar, a workplace consultant at CMG Associates in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older worker feels more vulnerable. When you get younger
mangers in, oftentimes I've heard it said that older employees feel
even more threatened,'' notes Cedar. ``They feel younger people are
simply looking for ways to get rid of older, more expensive
workers. This is coming from what individuals feel, and is
certainly not based on any company policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The workplace of the 1990s might seem threatening, even
volatile, to baby boomers. Generation Xers, by contrast, have
experienced little else but change, and they thrive on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Xers disdain authority for the sake of authority,''
says Tulgan, author of ``Managing Generation X'' (1995 Merritt
Publishing, $19.95). ``So, most of the young people who are moving
into positions of power tend to soft pedal their authority because
of perceived hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can cause problems in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they soft pedal their authority so much that when
things go wrong, they go ballistic,'' notes Tulgan ``And there may
be awkwardness with authority, which can be manifested by
inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyner claims her 21-year-old manager had temper tantrums and
blew up at her without cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I saw her blow up, right at the store,'' says Heyner.
``I was stunned. She started throwing papers around and yelling.
She didn't like the way (the jewelry) was being displayed. The
whole thing was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts stress most Generation X managers take their
responsibilities seriously. But they don't want to be held back by
policies such as seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a myth out there that these young people, as
managers, are slackers,'' said Tulgan. ``That's not true. These are
people who have come of age during the most profound changes in our
economy since the Industrial Revolution. For boomers, downsizing
and reorganizing and re-engineering may seem totally revolutionary
and frightening. But to Generation Xers, that's just the way things
are. They grew up with it, and they are taking advantage of the
changes and transformations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say, companies would do well to offer these young
managers what they crave most: training, plenty of feedback, clear
goals, and monthly rewards for job performance.
