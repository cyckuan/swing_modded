<P>
   When he catalogs the ups and downs of going to work for Apple
Computer at age 14, several elements are missing from Tom Williams'
unflinching, self-critical rap:
</P>
<P>
   Finger-pointing. Blame. Limp surrender to the Fates or
impersonal forces beyond his control, be they The Man, The System
or The Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the former wunderkind exhibits a headlong acceptance of
personal responsibility, a steadfast refusal to play the victim and
a firm acknowledgment that his own decisions -- good or bad -- have
given him the life he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand people who play victim,'' said Williams, now 21
and living in Los Angeles where he screens technological projects
for a venture capital firm. ``None of this was anybody's choice but
mine. No matter how impressionable or naive I have been, it has
always been my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jacob Leverich, 18, a freshly minted high school graduate
who holds down a sophisticated job at a high-end computer graphics
company, pragmatic faith in self is a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't allow someone to be responsible for my success; I
can't allow someone to protect me from failure,'' said Leverich,
who is headed to the University of Texas this fall. ``If I fail,
it's my responsibility to get back up and back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of technological innovation and economic
expansion is a back-to-the-future ethic that emphasizes individual
initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and
attitude of youth.
</P>
<P>
   In a land where Jerry Springer is a minor deity and the culture
of complaint, alibi and blame is so strong that a conservative
commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such unadulterated
blasts of personal responsibility are bracingly refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving in the direction of putting a greater emphasis on
personal responsibility rather than blaming fate or the social
structure,'' said Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at the
Camden, N.J., campus of Rutgers University. ``There's been a shift
in societal attitude away from blaming the system and looking for
blame in the individual. It's moving in a direction back toward a
more positive view of what you can do rather than complaining about
how the system is broke and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is particularly pronounced among the age groups
represented by Leverich and Williams, experts say. And this
provides sharp generational contrast with the graying Baby Boomers
just ahead of them on the march through life.
</P>
<P>
   Self-reliance is the common thread between kids like Leverich,
at the leading edge of what some sociologists call the Millennium
Generation, and young adults like Williams, who is at the tail end
of Generation X. Experts note that Xers manifest this
cross-generational trait with a decided cynicism and sense of
isolation, while Millennials are more optimistic and more likely to
band together.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that this is vague and mushy sociological
stuff, lacking the absolutes of atomic physics. Generation X is an
exceedingly broad monicker for anyone born after the Baby Boom and
before the Class of 2000 just now leaving high school.
</P>
<P>
   But polls back the notion of generational differences in outlook
about responsibility, self-reliance and the power of individual
effort.
</P>
<P>
   A July 1999 Pew Research Center survey shows that a
significantly higher share of those between ages 18 and 29 --
almost 79 percent -- believe individual effort is the key to
success. In contrast, only 71 percent of those between 30 and 49
believe this.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey shows the younger age group also has the
strongest belief in the power of the individual: 84 percent of
those 18 to 29 think everyone has the inner strength to succeed in
life; only 77 percent of those between the ages of 50 and 64 and 70
percent of those age 65 and older believe this.
</P>
<P>
   Xers and Millennials are also linked by matter-of-fact low
expectations about politics, government, corporations and other
traditional social institutions, the pros say.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that they look to others for support or
commitment, it's to a loose collective of friends, family or
like-minded peers, or non-traditional organizations like
non-profits.
</P>
<P>
   They believe in action over words, movement toward a goal rather
than discussion of an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way -- if the motto of Generation X is `Just
Do It,' then the motto of the Millennials is `Let's Do It,' while
the motto of the Baby Boomers is `Let's Meditate About It,''' said
Neil Howe, co-author of ``Generations: The History of America's
Future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of books with co-author William Strauss, Howe argues
that American history has been strongly influenced by a cycle of
generational traits ranging from idealism to alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers were idealistic until Vietnam, Nixon, the assassinations
of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr. and the economic
upheaval of the '70s and '80s made them disillusioned and
inward-looking, Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Xers are alienated and isolated, taking as a given the empty
promise of traditional societal institutions like family and
government, arming themselves with the cynical belief that they're
on their own. Howe said the most motivated of this generation turn
lone-wolf cynicism into individual action that has positioned them
to take advantage of the current economic expansion; those who
don't are slackers, missing out on the boom's big ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very libertarian generation,'' Howe said of the
Xers. ``They believe you take care of yourself, that you rely on
yourself and your platoon, your surrogate family. ... The take was:
Life can be cruel, you have to deal with it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Still a work in progress, the Millennials are just emerging from
high school. They exhibit the most optimism about the future, a
by-product of growing up in nothing-but-good economic times, in an
era of renewed emphasis on protecting kids from the ravages of
broken homes and other societal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Millenials are just as cynical about traditional
institutions and can be just as alienated as Xers, but he also
notes a mighty cross-current -- willingness to join cooperative
efforts that aren't self-centered, and belief that they can rise
above the challenges of the future.
</P>
<P>
   If that combination persists, it's Howe's belief that the
Millenials will take on the mantle of the World War II generation
and their unstinting belief in duty, honor and country.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this rings true to Jackson Pace. The teacher and
technology coordinator at Lyndon Baines Johnson High School in
Austin, Texas, works closely with the teen computer wizards in the
school's special science and technology program, including Jacob
Leverich.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennials in his program are technologically savvy,
confident that their computer skills are a bankable backstop for
the future. They're unburdened by the baggage carried by boomers --
such as the need to be in touch with every emotion, or the
financial worries ingrained by the economies of the '70s and '80s
and the Great Depression stories passed down by parents and
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no overriding fear that they can't whip it, they can't
overcome it,'' Pace, 43, said of his students. ``These kids have a
full toolbelt of skills. They analyze quicker, they assess need
quicker, they pull the tool, get it done and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace, a Baby Boomer, contrasts this with his own approach to
issues: ``I have to know that it's OK, know that you think it's OK,
and I want to talk to you about it being OK. We'll justify our
point and then do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids process it and get it done with no talk.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Pace thinks the Millennials have a decided advantage over Xers
-- a willingness to cooperate with each other, a sense of something
larger than themselves and a fearlessness born from prosperity and
comfort with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was
because that yuppie parent had money and they were another
possession,'' said Pace. ``And that created a real cynical kid. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids really are bubbling up in the last
quarter-century as renaissance kids. They're not money grubbers.
They know they can get the money. And I'm not sure they're basing
their human happiness on cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverich echoes this last point: ``What will make me happy is
not necessarily making more money. What will make me happy is to
set myself apart and not just be another person off the assembly
line.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Technology is the key to this confident self-reliance, said Mary
Ann Rafoth, professor of educational psychology at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania. Computer competence gives adolescents
and young adults a taste of success at a crucial stage of life, a
boost they are likely to ride into middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see technology as a big part of the future and they're
comfortable with it,'' Rafoth said. ``They tend to be
individualistic and see themselves in control and not the pawns of
giant, impersonal forces. That's because they haven't lived through
a Vietnam or World War II. They see it as getting what they want
out of life and nothing stopping them and technology enabling to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this confidence is an uninformed arrogance, an
unwillingness to acknowlege the value of life experiences outside
the narrow band of technological competence. It is the thing that
drives boomers to crazed distraction when they confront Xers and
Millennials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be more sophisticated and more knowlegeable about one
thing -- technology -- and because of that they won't give you
credit for the things you've lived through,'' Rafoth said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Howe, who runs management seminars, says fixation on technology
exacerbates the biggest cultural clash in the modern workplace --
the conflict between boomer-era managers and Xers who discount what
their elders have lived through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers are into mission statements and corporate culture and
creating a sense of community and team play,'' said Howe. ``Xers
are much more contractual about work. `If it's 5 o'clock, I'm outta
here.' They say they bring to the job all they need to bring. They
don't bring all the baggage and expectations that boomers bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennials share this transactional attitude about work, but
sport it with less of a nasty edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being the enemy of these corporations, it's just
where we go to work,'' said Leverich. ``I don't see them as my
enemy, but I don't see them as my savior, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who sometimes sounds like a world-weary boomer instead
of the tail-end Xer he is, buys the notion that his generation
believes in self- determination. But he doesn't see this as
something noble. Deserted by divorcing parents and discredited
social institutions, Xers had no choice but to rely on their own
devices, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't see his generation or the Millennials as any less
self- absorbed than the boomers. As proof he cites the resiliance
of conspicuous consumption, wide reliance on the anti-depressant
Prozac and the popularity of the public self-confessional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wryly notes the grit and high-tech gumption of his
peers and the next generation down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was Steven Spielberg,'' he jokes. ``All of his
movies, which we all grew up on, feature kids overcoming problems
and saving the adults. We've grown up with this very surreptitious,
but very strong can-do attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limitation of my father's generation and his father's
generation was to never dare something beyond your station in life.
Today, those self-imposed mental barriers are no longer there. You
can do almost anything and accomplish almost anything you set out
to accomplish.''
