PROZAC DIARY 
By Lauren Slater 
Random House, 203 pp., $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny book about Prozac? That seems a conceptual stretch,
especially from a young author who is as candid about the pitfalls
of taking Prozac _ including writer's block and sexual dysfunction
_ as she is about the drug's psychologically liberating properties.
</P>
<P>
   Humor, however, turns out to be one of the chief virtues of
Lauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' which takes up roughly where the
critically acclaimed ``Welcome to My Country,'' her first book
about her battle with mental illness, left off. Material that might
be cloying or self-pitying in the hands of a lesser writer sparkles
with originality in hers. A treatise on psychopharmacology (``the
one branch of medicine where there is no need for intimacy,''
writes Slater) becomes a bittersweet love story about A Woman and
Her Pill. The real-life love story of the author and her boyfriend,
a chemist, inspires a hilarious episode concerning homeopathy and
codependence.
</P>
<P>
   Slater even leaps from a sober meditation on frigidity to the
notion that Prozac could be the ultimate tool for radical feminists
_ freeing heterosexual women from the tyranny of libido by
rendering men, well, useless. Elsewhere, she recounts a furious
exchange with her doctor after the drug's potency has inexplicably
worn off. Well, the physician suggests, it must be a case of
``Prozac poop-out.'' Slater: ```Prozac poop-out?' I said. `You've
got to be kidding me.' I was taking a drug with a prostate problem,
a drug with sexual dysfunction ...'' Finding such humor amid a
harrowing relapse speaks strongly to Slater's writerly instincts.
</P>
<P>
   In her other life, Slater, a psychologist with degrees from
Harvard and Boston University, runs an outpatient clinic in East
Boston. Between the ages of 14 and 24, however, she was
hospitalized five times for depression and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. An anorexic, she still bears the scars of having sliced
herself with razor blades. Until she found Prozac, Slater had never
had a steady boyfriend or a normal relationship with food or a
semblance of a vocation, other than writing poetry and short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, she was given the potent antidepressant that had
just hit the market. Slater began with 20 milligrams daily; she
would wind up with a prescription for four times that dosage. Her
initial reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that her doctor
doubted it could be real. She felt high, Slater writes _ acid-trip
high. A brave new world opened up to her: first through real estate
magazines and open houses, then bar drinks, home cooking, and ATM
machines. She was a 26-year-old with ``the judgment of an early
adolescent,'' as she describes it. Meeting a stranger at a rock
concert, she follows him to a park and reluctantly has sex with
him. With her liberation come dangers for which Slater is totally
unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Prozac has replaced writing as her one true love.
She gets a job teaching literacy skills to immigrants. She gains
acceptance to graduate school. From small triumphs _ keeping an
apartment, managing a checkbook _ she moves on to far greater ones.
Meanwhile, she finds herself surrendering to the drug's deeper
spiritual and philosophical mysteries. ``Secretly,'' writes Slater,
``I started to fear a nuclear war only for the effects it would
have on the pharmacies.''
</P>
<P>
   Each step forward is dogged by doubt, however. Illness has been
so strong a component of her identity that its absence causes
Slater to panic. Her intellectual affinity for philosophers and
theologians causes Slater to liken Prozac to a ``Zen drug'' and
herself to a Buddhist novitiate: another side effect not advertised
by the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Prozac has made me into a nun,'' the author worries,
``or a nurse, or worse, a Calgon Lady.'' She contests Peter
Kramer's assertion in ``Listening to Prozac'' that the drug makes
its users ``better than well.'' Instead, Slater suggests, Prozac is
more like ``psychotropic Drano'' _ a remedy that trades higher
functioning for addiction and the frustrating loss of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac Diary'' is made up of notes and journal entries, scraps
of memory, and letters to Slater's doctor. The collage effect
notwithstanding, the book is tightly bound by its humor and
intelligence. Slater's writing is confessional without being
sentimental, honest without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   While she has tried to wean herself off Prozac, Slater still
depends on it, she writes, to get along with her life and career.
On good days, she calculates, that means functioning at 70 percent
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac is a medicine that takes much away,'' the author
concludes, ``but its very presence in my life has been about
preserving as well as decaying.''
</P>
<P>
   With wit and courage, she makes that presence felt.
