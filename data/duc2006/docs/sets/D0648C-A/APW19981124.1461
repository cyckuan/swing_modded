	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Newly published research confirms that drugs are
effective in treating children with obsessive-compulsive disorder,
an illness that afflicts hundreds of thousands of youngsters across
America.
	   The newest medication shown safe and effective in compulsive
youngsters is sertraline, marketed as Zoloft, according to the
study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   ``There are lots of kids who are undiagnosed, or if they are
diagnosed are not being treated,'' said the study's lead author,
Dr. John S. March of Duke University Medical Center. He said drugs
work best when combined with psychotherapy.
	   The findings bring to three the number of similar drugs that
have worked well in large trials among compulsive children at
multiple medical centers, said Dr. Judith L. Rapoport of the Child
Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Health.
	   The Food and Drug Administration used the study, funded by
Zoloft maker Pfizer Inc., as evidence for approving the drug for
treating OCD in children. It already had been approved for the
disorder in adults.
	   The other OCD drugs approved for both age groups are
clomipramine, marketed as Anafranil, and fluvoxamine, marketed as
Luvox. In addition, the antidepressant fluoxetine, marketed as
Prozac, has been reported in small trials to work well in childhood
OCD, Rapoport said.
	   Like the other drugs, Prozac buoys brain levels of serotonin, a
chemical messenger between nerves that is key in mood, sleep and
appetite. Its role in OCD is unknown, but sufferers of OCD often
have overlapping problems with depression, anxiety or eating
disorders, previous studies show.
	   Hallmarks of OCD are senseless and repetitive thoughts and
behaviors that typically deal with grooming, contamination or
danger. An example would be excessive hand-washing.
	   Up to half of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder show the
first signs of it in childhood. And up to half of children
identified with OCD respond to drug treatment, Rapoport wrote in an
editorial accompanying the study.
	   Estimates of the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder
range from 0.5 percent to 1 percent of U.S. school-age children, or
about 250,000 to 500,000 youngsters.
