<HEADLINE> Stigma Keeps Millions of Americans from Treating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Anxiety disorders,
America's most common mental illness, largely go untreated because
of shame, fear and embarrassment, according to a nationwide poll
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll release by the National Mental Health Association
found more than half of Americans believe that stigma prevents
individuals with anxiety disorders from seeking treatment, despite
a surprisingly high recognition of the illness.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, 19 million Americans suffer from
anxiety disorders, and fewer than one third receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
"These findings account for the wide occurrence between the
common accurrance of anxiety disorders and the low numbers in
treatment," the association president Michael Faenza said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The shame associated with anxiety disorder is "completely
unfounded," he said. "Anxiety disorders are real illnesses that
deserve the same level of understanding and treatment as diabetes,
arthritis or heart disease."
</P>
<P>
Stigma, such as the fear of being perceived as weak, appears to
be based on misinformation, the association said. Though 81
percent of those polled were aware of anxiety disorders, 61
percent wrongly believe that they occur in people who lack the
will power to cope with everyday life stress, are usually caused
by underlying guilt, or will go away if ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
But the association said that the study also yielded one
hopeful conclusion. The more people recognized that anxiety
disorders are real illnesses, the less likely they were to have
misperceptions about the their root causes and more likely they
were to believe that medical and psychological treatments work.
</P>
<P>
"Education is still vital," Faenza said. "Americans need to
know the real deal about anxiety disorders, their signs and
symptoms and their causes. Since people with anxiety disorders are
at high risk of suicide, eradicating misunderstanding and stigma
with a good dose of the facts can really save lives."
</P>
<P>
The National Mental Health Association has launched an anxiety
disorders public education campaign, which will target both the
general public and primary care physicians. Many doctors are not
trained to detect or treat anxiety disorders and frequently
individuals go misdiagnosed or untreated, said the organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, the illness includes panic,
obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety
disorders and phobia such as social phobia. Symptoms of these
disorders include panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks,
nightmares and frightening physical symptoms. Each anxiety
disorder has emotional, psychological and biological underpinnings
and can be treated through targeted psychotherapy, medications or
a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
Anxiety disorders cost the United States 46.6 billion dollars
each year, nearly one-third of the nation's total mental health
bill of 146 billion dollars, according to the association.
