COMMENTARY: THE POLITICS OF CRUELTY

   NEW YORK _ Barry Turner lives alone in a fifth-floor walkup on a
quiet street in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn. He's a
nervous man. Fidgets all the time. He smokes Kool cigarettes and
drinks prodigious amounts of orange Kool-Aid. He suffers from
obsessive-compulsive disorder. He takes two types of medication to
stave off psychotic episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first started noticing the symptoms in 1993,'' said Turner.
``I was a foot messenger. When I would ride the subways, yeah, my
mouth would start twitching. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the crowds on the trains bothered him. ``I just would
start thinking, `Oh, I might say something to somebody who was
staring at me.' And then the mouth twitching would start and I'd
have to get off and wait for another train. And then my boss would
say, `What did you do, go sightseeing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Turner sat at his kitchen table Tuesday and talked about his
precarious day-to-day existence. Five days a week he goes to a
state-run psychiatric center in the Cobble Hill neighborhood where
he gets his medication and counseling. The center is affiliated
with the South Beach Psychiatric Facility on Staten Island and
serves about 500 mentally ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, the center has meant the difference between
stability and chaos. ``Since South Beach, I seem to feel much
better,'' he said. ``I don't feel as nervous as I did in '93. I'm
trying to test myself in the subways and buses to see if I can
manage once again to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner was more nervous than usual during the interview because
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had threatened to evict the psychiatric
center from its city-owned building and replace it with a homeless
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a typically grotesque Giuliani gesture. Never mind that
the psychiatric center by all accounts has been successfully
helping troubled individuals for decades, and that it was welcomed
by its Cobble Hill neighbors. The mayor was angry with the local
councilman, Stephen DiBrienza, for sponsoring homeless legislation
that the mayor didn't like. So he decided to punish DiBrienza and
his constituents by evicting the psychiatric center and forcing a
homeless shelter into its space. A homeless shelter that was not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to the mayor's plan was 100 percent. The New York
Times, in an editorial, said, ``This stacks up as revenge politics,
no matter how the mayor's aides spin it.'' Five hundred people
showed up at a community meeting last week to denounce the mayor's
plan. James Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the
Assembly's Mental Health Committee, sent the mayor a letter that
said, ``In my 14 years in office I have never seen a more
irresponsible, immature and abusive misuse of high office.'' The
Legal Aid Society threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of the
mentally ill patients served by the psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   After my interview with Turner, I learned that the mayor had
bowed to the pressure and backed off. The psychiatric center can
stay, he said. But other agencies in the six-story building,
including programs that help the elderly and young children, will
have to go. A homeless shelter is going into the building, the
mayor said, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised the politics of cruelty to a high art. Among
the programs to be evicted are Heights and Hills, which provides
services to frail and otherwise vulnerable senior citizens, and
Families First, a program that offers parenting help and day care
to families with children under 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's evicting infants, toddlers and elderly folks with
Alzheimer's,'' said Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   This is a purely destructive move by the mayor. No one is
unhappy with the programs, but he is unhappy with DiBrienza so he
is bulldozing them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during my visit, Barry Turner stood up from the
table and poured a large glass of Kool-Aid. He drank it down fast,
and poured another. I asked if he smoked much. He said yes, the
Kools help keep him from coughing.
</P>
<P>
   Later I wondered about the elderly, some of them nervous and
forgetful, who will be looking for help in new venues if the mayor
gets his way. And the children whose families may become
destabilized without the help they get from Families First.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in the wrong hands can be a terrible thing.
