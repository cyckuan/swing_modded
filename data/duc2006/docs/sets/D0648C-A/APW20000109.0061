<HEADLINE> Mental Illness Drives Bodybuilders?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- What drives some bodybuilders is a form of mental illness
that can be treated with drugs, a researcher says.
</P>
<P>
	   These people have a type of body dysmorphic disorder, a condition which is
characterized by a preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in
appearance, said Dr. Eric Hollander of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Body dysmorphic disorder affects probably 1 to 2 percent of the U.S.
population, but among men in particular there is a sort of subclassification
called 'bigorexia,' which is sort of the opposite of anorexia," Hollander said.
Anorexics think they are too fat, no matter how thin they are -- and bigorexics
think themselves too small, no matter how big they are, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bigorexia, more properly termed muscle dysmorphia, is not yet formally
recognized as a psychiatric condition, Hollander said. But the coming revision
of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual will
describe the condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bodybuilding can be a healthy competition, but these people take muscle
development to the point at which it interferes with ordinary living, including
holding a job or staying healthy, Hollander said. "They will continue to
exercise even after they have dislocated a shoulder," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As an expression of body dysmorphic disorder, muscle dysmorphia is an
obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, Hollander said. People with OCD are
driven to do things such as repeatedly check their appearance in mirrors and
perform ritualistic movements.
</P>
<P>
	   "An exaggerated sense that something doesn't look right" seems to have
origins in brain chemistry, Hollander said. He and his colleagues reported in
Archives of General Psychiatry on the effects of the drug clomipramine on the
brain chemical serotonin.
</P>
<P>
	   One of serotonin's normal roles seems to be in turning off brain processes
that signal when "things don't fit our conceived notions," Hollander said. If
serotonin levels are abnormally low, however, it can't turn off the mental alarm
bell that rings when things don't seem right, and the bell keeps on ringing even
when things are right, he said. Clomipramine helps the brain raise serotonin
levels by interfering with the body's ability to destroy the chemical, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollander and his colleagues wanted to be sure clomipramine was producing
improvements in the behavior of people with body dysmorphic disorder, and that
the patients were not improving simply because they knew they were getting
treatment and therefore expected themselves to improve. So the researchers
compared clomipramine with another drug, desipramine, which had similar side
effects but does not affect serotonin.
</P>
<P>
	   Clomipramine treatment was significantly better in reducing patients'
repetitive movements and obsessive preoccupation with perceived flaws, the study
found. But it is not a cure, Hollander said. "Don't think about symptoms going
down to zero," he said. "They were 25 to 35 percent improved." There was,
however, a significant improvement in their ability to go back to school or
function at work, and a significant drop in their thoughts of suicide, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although this study did not focus on muscle dysmorphia, treatment for body
dysmorphia has been shown to work on muscle dysmorphia, Hollander said. And a
clinician who was not involved in the study said she found the drug to work,
especially in combination with psychological therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't feel behavior therapy is sufficient, and certainly medications are
not efficacious alone either," said Fugen Neziroglu, senior clinical director of
the Bio-Behavioral Institute in Great Neck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Neziroglu has treated a number of people with muscle dysmorphia. "I had one
who just left, an attractive, nice, 44-year-old man, he's telling me he has flab
on his sides," she said. "You look at him and you know he has no flab."
</P>
<P>
	   Medications help to stabilize patients with muscle dysmorphia, but therapy
is needed to retrain habits and thought patterns needed to make the improvements
last, Neziroglu said. Clomipramine is one of the better drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And therapy alone may be adequate treatment, said James Rosen, a clinical
psychologist and professor at the University of Vermont. The
cognitive-behavioral approach teaches patients to realize when their thoughts
are unrealistic, recast their self-image into more neutral terms, and adapt to
situations that could set off the compulsion, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For muscle dysmorphia, this could include easing away from the idea that the
exercisers would lose control of themselves if they skip a workout, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, one bodybuilding promoter said he couldn't tell whether
bodybuilders have this condition. High-level bodybuilders are like other
athletes in paying extremely close attention to what they eat, how much they
exercise and where they fall short of their own goals, said James Lorimer of the
Arnold Schwarzenegger Fitness Weekend, Feb. 22-27 in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say I place these particular athletes outside the normal range of
people who are trying to be the best they can be in whatever sport they are in,"
Lorimer said. "You can say it's excessive, it's unusual, but (I) can't say
whether it is disordered or not."
