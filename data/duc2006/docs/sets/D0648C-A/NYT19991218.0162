   The United States is suffering from a veritable epidemic of
mental illness, according to a report last week by the surgeon
general, which asserted that ``22 percent of the population has a
diagnosable mental disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   But how is mental illness defined? The standard reference used
by therapists for diagnosis and for assigning insurance-payment
codes is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent edition, DSM-IV, which was issued in 1994, lists
more than 300 kinds of mental disorders _ a far cry from the 22
illnesses identified in 1918 in the Statistical Manual for the Use
of Institutions for the Insane, the precursor to the DSM.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, DSM-IV provides standardized diagnoses
for debilitating mental illnesses like psychoses, major
depressions, anxieties, phobias and personality disorders. But
critics contend that the manual contains large gray areas in which
ordinary life-adjustment problems and vexing behaviors are
classified as mental illnesses requiring clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some disorders found in those gray areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE SHARKEY
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Therapists and the courts have always struggled to separate
mental illness from bad behavior. For example, a good percentage of
any prison's criminal population would seem to fit the criteria for
Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful
behaviors ...
</P>
<P>
   2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of
aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   4. Irritability and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.
</P>
<P>
   6. Consistent irresponsibility ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On the other hand, some behavior classified as mental illness
seems to apply to quite functional, if annoying, people. How could
Hollywood or Sunday morning television media-punditry thrive
without personalities who exhibit the symptoms of Histrionic
Personality Disorder (301.50)? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   2. Interaction with others is often characterized by
inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior.
</P>
<P>
   3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to
self.
</P>
<P>
   5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and
lacking in detail.
</P>
<P>
   6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality and exaggerated
expression of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   7. Is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they really
are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Without doubt, psychiatric treatment is a life-saver for many
deeply troubled children. But given the manual's broad definitions,
many parents might question whether every adolescent is
certifiable, at least on occasion. Consider the criteria for
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Often loses temper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Argues with adults.
</P>
<P>
   3. Actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or
rules.
</P>
<P>
   4. Deliberately annoys people.
</P>
<P>
   5. Blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   6. Is touchy or easily annoyed by others.
</P>
<P>
   7. Is spiteful or vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clinicians treating severe drug and alcohol addiction work
within a wide range of diagnostic categories. The following also
qualify as ``substance related disorders'':
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine Intoxication (305.90): Recent consumption of caffeine
in excess of 259 mg (e.g. more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee ...)
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine Dependence Disorder (305.10): Tolerance to nicotine is
manifested by the absence of nausea, dizziness and other
characteristic symptoms ....
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine Withdrawal Disorder 292.0: Abrupt cessation of nicotine
use ((resulting in)) dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia;
irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty
concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart-rate; increased
appetite. &LR;
</P>
<P>

   Despite the comedy spin that Jack Nicholson put on it in the
movie ``As Good as It Gets,'' obsessive-compulsive disorder can be
debilitating. But the DSM's diagnostic criteria also suggest that
the fretful workaholic with that desktop Snoopy figurine collection
may require treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder
(301.4):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization
or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is
lost.
</P>
<P>
   2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion ...
</P>
<P>
   3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the
exclusion of leisure activities and friendships ...
</P>
<P>
   4. Is over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about
matters of morality, ethics or values (not accounted for by
cultural or religious identification).
</P>
<P>
   5. Is unable to discard worn out or worthless objects ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many critics argue that the DSM often reflects political and
cultural biases. For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental
illness as recently as 1968 in DSM-II, which defined it as Sexual
Deviation (302):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This category is for individuals whose sexual interests are
directed primarily towards objects other than people of the
opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus
.... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The gay-rights movement ultimately pressured the American
Psychiatric Association to eliminate homosexuality as a mental
disorder in subsequent editions of the DSM. Cross-dressing males,
however, are still categorized as mentally ill if they exhibit the
signs of Transvestic Fetishism (302.3):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Over a period of at least 6 months in a heterosexual male,
recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or
behaviors involving cross-dressing. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The manual suggests that additional clinical research be devoted
to treatment for those who suffer from the symptoms of Identity
Problem (313.82):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Uncertainty about multiple issues relating to identity, such as
long-term goals, career choice, friendship patterns, sexual
orientation and behavior, moral values and group loyalties. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other diagnoses shift with the cultural climate. The latest DSM,
for example, eliminated one controversial diagnosis that was
previously applied to women suffering depression, Self-Defeating
Personality Disorder (301.90):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment,
failure or mistreatment ...
</P>
<P>
   2. Rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help
him or her.
</P>
<P>
   3. Following positive personal events (e.g., a new achievement),
responds with depression ...
</P>
<P>
   4. Incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then
feels hurt, defeated or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in
public ...).
</P>
<P>
   5. Rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to
acknowledge enjoying himself or herself. ...
</P>
<P>
   6. Fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal
objectives. ...
</P>
<P>
   7. Is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat
him or her well ...
</P>
<P>
   8. Engages in excessive self-sacrifice ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The DSM suggests that denial can be itself be a symptom of a
disorder called Non-Compliance with Treatment (V15.81):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The reasons for noncompliance may include discomfort resulting
from treatment (e.g., medication side-effects); expense of
treatment; decisions based on personal value judgments or religious
or cultural beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of the
proposed treatment; ((and)) maladaptive personality traits ... &LR;
