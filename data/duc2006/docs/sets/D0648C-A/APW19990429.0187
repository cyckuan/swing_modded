<P>
	Luvox, the medication Columbine High gunman Eric Harris was said  
to be taking, is an antidepressant commonly prescribed to treat 
obsessive-compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, known generically as fluvoxamine, boosts the brain's  
supply of a message-carrying chemical called serotonin and helps 
people lead normal lives without being plagued by unwanted, 
recurring thoughts and impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the attack, Harris, an 18-year-old senior, was  
rejected by the Marine Corps because he was taking Luvox, according 
to published reports. Investigators said they are interested in 
whether Harris' condition could be linked to the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Luvox requires several weeks to take effect, and remains in the  
body for several weeks after patients stop taking it. The drug can 
cause a variety of mild side effects, such as nervousness, 
dizziness and anxiety, but these are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims of obsessive-compulsive behavior often feel compelled to  
perform the same task over and over, such as washing their hands or 
checking to make sure the door is locked. About 2 percent of adults 
have the disorder, and the first signs often appear in childhood.
