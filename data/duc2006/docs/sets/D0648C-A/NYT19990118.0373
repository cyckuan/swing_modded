   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She was only 19, yet she was sure she
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   She woke up perspiring, trying desperately to catch her breath.
She ran to the bathroom with diarrhea and surges of nausea. For
three hours, she suffered, certain she would never see morning.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of her grandmother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced I was going to die,'' recalled Lisa
Cvijanovic, now 34. ``I thought I was having a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't. Cvijanovic later learned she had the classic
symptoms of a panic attack: an unprovoked feeling of extreme fear
that produces intense physical sensations ranging from dizziness
and trembling to chest pain and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it starts when the human survival instinct _ that
fight-or-flight response _ goes haywire.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is an easily treatable mental illness often triggered by
stress, such as the kind Cvijanovic experienced when her
grandmother died. But because the symptoms mimic physical problems
such as heart attacks, sufferers often have difficulty getting a
correct diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're stuck on a train track and can't escape,''
Cvijanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Even successful people like actresses Calista Flockhart (Ally
McBeal) and Kim Basinger are among those who suffer panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients with panic disorder are really frightened of the
internal feelings of anxiety _ the sweating, palpitations, the
bodily changes that can be normal in the course of everyday
activities,'' explains Dr. Cynthia Last, a Boca Raton psychologist
and director of the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to desensitize themselves because there are many
things that feel like panic, such as when you exercise hard, or get
angry, or even have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic disorder is one of several anxiety disorders, which
include post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. One in 10 Americans will suffer some form of anxiety, the
Anxiety Disorders Association of America estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Theories hold that people who develop anxiety and panic attacks
are predisposed to it biologically or environmentally: You might
inherit a gene for it _ although none has been identified _ or you
may be conditioned for it by seeing family members react to stress
with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic can't recall anyone in her family who had panic
attacks, but she vividly remembers her father dying at home of a
brain tumor when she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gasping for air; he was in a coma. I was experiencing
it all, all over again (with her panic attack).''
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic's symptoms disappeared after that initial attack, but
she feared they would return. They did, when she was 21. She can't
explain why. There was nothing particularly stressful going on in
her life. But suddenly she was having several attacks a day and
wound up in the hospital emergency room several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted someone to say that I wasn't dying. I needed
that reassurance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated, unprovoked attacks are also central to panic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors kept telling me it was panic, but I wouldn't
believe that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks became disabling, making it hard or impossible for
her to work, go shopping or otherwise live a normal life. She was
afraid of suffering attacks while she was out and of appearing
crazy to people around her. Left untreated, panic disorder can lead
to agoraphobia, the fear of being outside the patient's ``safe''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors eventually started her on a medication, Klonopin. ``As
long as I had the bottle in my hand, even, I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic sufferers often latch on to items that make them feel
safe, but that don't actually help curb the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Irrational thinking produces panic. Therapy is designed to ease
the catastrophic thoughts that produce fear and the related
physical feelings of anxiety. Patients can be treated with therapy,
medication such as antidepressants or tranquilizers, or a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Most therapists discourage drug treatment alone because the
patient never learns to control the thinking that causes attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research shows that cognitive-behavioral therapy is
equally as effective as drugs,'' says Dr. Andrew Rosen, a Delray
Beach psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the therapy has longer-lasting results because it becomes
part of the person. There is greater confidence the person can
control it. As soon as the patient is off medication, if they
haven't learned how to change their behavior, they're back to where
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Cvijanovic has experienced a roller coaster ride with panic, and
is back in therapy after years of going panic-free. The attacks
returned when she got divorced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She now has a flexible job that lets her work at home, but she
hopes to return to an office full-time someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discourage people,'' she said. ``I want them
to know that there's coping skills available. It's definitely not
easy, but I will not let panic attacks get me. I won't let it
conquer me.''
