<HEADLINE> Tyson May Lose Jail Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson will learn Wednesday whether  
he'll lose privileges and time off for good behavior for hurling a 
TV during an outburst in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion faces a closed hearing at  
Montgomery County (Md.) Correction Center that day and a ruling 
will be announced then, the county's Department of Corrections said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Department spokesman Eric Seleznow said jail officials cited  
Tyson for destruction of property, assault on correctional staff 
and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	A disciplinary panel will determine Tyson's level of  
responsibility. Penalties could include loss of privileges and 
credit for good behavior in time served. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old boxer has been in an isolation cell since  
Friday, when he tossed a television set against jail bars in an 
inmate recreation area. He reportedly became agitated when a guard 
hung up a telephone he was using. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officials have three working days to have a hearing to  
consider all the facts relevant to the incident,'' Seleznow said. 
``At this point, we're not considering criminal charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jail officials Monday assessed Tyson's medical care, said a law  
enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is serving a one-year sentence for assaulting two men  
after a minor traffic accident in August in suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	His jail outburst occurred two days after jail officials began  
withholding his daily dose of Zoloft, an antidepressant medication 
prescribed to manage what doctors have described as mood swings, a 
boxing source who requested anonymity told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who testified at Tyson's licensing hearing before the  
Nevada Athletic Commission in October said he is frequently 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	He is being treated by Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman of the  
psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical Center. The 
boxing source said Goldberg had unsuccessfully attempted to 
persuade jail officials to allow Tyson to continue his medication. 
</P>
<P>
	A Georgetown spokesman on Friday said Goldberg would not comment  
on the latest developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoloft is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the  
treatment of depression, panic disorder and obsessive compulsive 
disorder. Experts say abruptly withholding the medication from a 
patient would not lead to enhanced mood swings, but it could affect 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the major rules in medicine is don't rock a stable  
boat,'' said Dr. John Greist, a clinical psychiatry professor at 
the Institute of Medicine in Madison, Wis. Greist, who began 
working with Zoloft three years before its FDA approval in 1991, 
has prescribed Zoloft for more than 200 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if Zoloft reduced irritability, anger and  
aggression, then ``discontinuing it gradually or abruptly would 
permit those inherent characteristics to reemerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before last Wednesday, Tyson had taken Zoloft on a daily basis  
for four months with the exception of the week preceding his Jan. 
16 fight with Francois Botha. A boxing source, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said he began taking it again the day after 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson won a fifth-round decision against Botha in his first  
since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during 
a championship bout in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While training for the Botha fight in Phoenix in December, Tyson  
appeared in good spirits. The week of the fight Tyson was combative 
at times, using profanity in one exchange with a television 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. Indiana 
officials will consider whether to revoke his probation based on 
his legal problems in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to the Maryland charges, but has until  
March 7 to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisers hoped he would be assigned to a prerelease  
program within 60 days. His assignment to a halfway house would 
have enabled him to resume his training, but this latest episode in 
jail could affect his eligibility for that program.
