<P>
   At what point do many cats become too many cats?
</P>
<P>
   News reports about exonerated murder suspect Edmund F. Burke
have made much of the fact that he kept 30-odd cats in his home,
including four dead cats in his refrigerator. (Burke's lawyer
explained that his client was waiting for the ground to thaw so he
could bury them.) The cats, alive and dead, were seen by many as
prima facie evidence that Burke is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Bishop thinks it's unfortunate that the Burke case linked
multiple cat ownership with violence. ``Some people may think it's
eccentric,'' she said. ``But it doesn't indicate a violent person.
Usually just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop runs the Alliance for Animals in Arlington, Mass., a
no-kill shelter with a low-cost spay and neuter clinic and a cat
adoption center. She explained the difference between cat rescuers
and cat hoarders.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers are people who shelter cats in their homes, spay or
neuter them, take good care of them, and try to adopt them out. Cat
hoarders are another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take in animals because they can't bear to see them
suffer,'' Bishop said, ``but then they can't take care of the
animals. The animals are breeding in the home, they're suffering,
they're dying, and the person can't see it. They honestly think
they're saving the animals. They tend to be suspicious, they don't
trust anybody. So they think that even if the animals die in their
house, they're better off than they would be in a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal hoarding is a serious issue for humane societies. Dr.
Gary Patronek, director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy
at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is conducting a
study of the phenomenon. `Hoarding behavior of any kind is not well
understood,'' Patronek said, ``and when it involves living
creatures it adds a whole other dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Patronek said animal hoarding appears to be a mental health
problem, but exactly what kind is unclear. ``There are indications
that it may involve obsessive-compulsive disorder, brain disorders,
brain deterioration,'' he said. ``It seems to be a final common
pathway for a variety of disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal hoarding is often dismissed as a lifestyle choice,
Patronek said. The problem is bounced from one agency to another _
from public health to law enforcement to mental health to humane
societies. He hopes the study will help shed light on the problem
and lead to finding better ways to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Patronek's initial findings appear in the January issue of the
journal Public Health Reports. In his article, ``Hoarding Animals:
An Undermanaged Public Health Problem in a Difficult-to-Study
Population,'' he lists five indicators of pathological animal
hoarding behavior. (Three-quarters of the cases he studied involved
women, hence the choice of pronoun.)
</P>
<P>
   --She accumulates a large number of animals.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to provide minimal standards of nutrition,
sanitation, and veterinary care.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to act on the deteriorating conditions of the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   --She fails to act on the deteriorating environment. ``We're
talking about a foot of feces on the floor in some of these
cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --She doesn't respond to the negative effects the environment
may be having on her own well-being and that of family members and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Patronek emphasized that keeping multiple cats or other animals
is not necessarily an indication of mental instability. ``I would
never say that. There are countless examples of people who have
large numbers of animals and take care of them perfectly,'' he
said.
