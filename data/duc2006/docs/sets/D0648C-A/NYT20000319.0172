BY CHILDREN

   WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a major effort on
Monday to reverse a sharp increase in the number of preschool
children using Ritalin, Prozac and other powerful psychiatric
drugs, administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the initiative, they said, the government will inform
parents and teachers about the risks of such drugs, the Food and
Drug Administration will develop new drug labels, the National
Institutes of Health will begin a huge nationwide study of Ritalin
use in children under the age of 6, and the White House will hold a
conference this fall on the diagnosis and treatment of mental
illness in very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal health officials plan to meet
on Monday with parents, psychiatrists, pediatricians,
psychologists, nurses and social workers to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then the administration plans to issue a statement declaring
that ``the use of medication is not generally the first option for
a preschool child with a psychiatric disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study last month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers reported that there had apparently been a
sharp increase in the number of preschoolers taking psychotropic
drugs, particularly stimulants like Ritalin and antidepressants
like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The study caused concern among parents and medical experts
alike, and the administration is now trying to address that
concern.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, said, ``As a rule of thumb, doctors,
psychologists and social workers should attempt to modify the
behavior of a child and deal with family crises before drugs are
prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has prepared a new guide for parents on the
treatment of young children with mental disorders. ``When
medication is used, it should not be the only strategy,'' but
should be part of an overall treatment plan, the guide says.
Parents and doctors may want to consider behavioral therapy for the
child, family therapy and other techniques to help manage the
child's symptoms, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the initiative was inspired mainly
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who they said wanted to announce some
immediate steps after seeing the immense public concern about the
use of powerful pills to treat toddlers with emotional and
behavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate in New York, but White
House officials said it would be cynical to believe that her
motives were only political. They noted that for years she has been
interested in children's issues, including the testing and labeling
of drugs for children. Health officials and medical experts said
the government's concern was well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Mrs. Clinton does is related to her campaign, but
this initiative has substance too,'' a federal health official
said. ``We want doctors and parents to think about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last month, Dr. Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of the
psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School, said that children
with behavioral disorders were ``increasingly subjected to quick
and inexpensive pharmacologic fixes,'' even though ``there is no
empirical evidence to support psychotropic drug treatment in very
young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ritalin carries a warning that says, ``Ritalin should
not be used in children under 6 years, since safety and efficacy in
this age group have not been established.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the National Institute of Mental Health would
spend $6 million in the next five years to study whether Ritalin
was safe and effective in treating preschoolers with the impulsive,
aggressive behavior traits known as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder _ the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Hyman said, hundreds of girls and boys at research
centers around the country will receive Ritalin, behavior therapy
or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the problem was not simply that children were
being overmedicated, but that they were not being appropriately
evaluated and treated. ``In some communities,'' he said, ``too few
children are receiving medications, just as in other communities,
too many are getting medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists said that they recognized that drug
therapy could sometimes provide relief to young children. ``If a
kid is engaged in aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, head
banging, and is otherwise uncontrollable, you should try
medication,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs are widely prescribed for young children even
though they have not been studied, approved or labeled for such
use. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine; after a
drug is approved for one purpose, doctors often prescribe it for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said, for example, that some medications used to
treat depression and anxiety disorders in children, like Paxil,
Prozac and Wellbutrin, were not labeled for pediatric use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said, Zoloft has been approved to
treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 6 and older, while
Luvox has been approved for the same condition in children 8 and
older. But both drugs are used in younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Drug labels often do not specify the proper doses for children.
The White House said that the food and drug agency would soon
specify how drug companies should conduct the research needed to
develop ``pediatric dosage information'' that can be included on
the labels of Ritalin, clonidine and other drugs used to treat
hyperactivity and other attention deficit disorders in young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
that in the last year her agency had sent letters to seven
companies asking them to study the effects of antidepressants in
young people 7 to 18 years old. The government, she said, is
analyzing ways in which research on younger children can be
scientifically and ethically conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said: ``Lots of mood disorders and anxiety disorders begin
in childhood. But the younger a child is, the more difficult it is
to make a diagnosis of mental disorder with certainty. It is quite
difficult to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in
children under 6 because they are usually not articulate, their
brains and behavior are changing rapidly, and they are very
reactive to their environment.''
