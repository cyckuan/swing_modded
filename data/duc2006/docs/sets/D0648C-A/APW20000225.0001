<HEADLINE> Judge: Man who claims Prozac caused him to rob banks, store  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Wallingford man who claims an overdose of Prozac
made him insane, leading him to rob banks and a department store, has been found
innocent by reason of mental disability or defect.
<P>
	   In a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge Richard Arnold on Thursday found
Christopher DeAngelo, 28, innocent of the 1997 robberies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a case of somebody pulling a fast one or being too clever,"
said DeAngelo's attorney, John Williams. "The hard indisputable fact of this
case is that this young man was driven to commit crimes by a prescription drug."
</P>
<P>
	   State psychiatrists in July supported the findings of defense experts,
concluding that DeAngelo's actions at the time of the robberies were linked to
his Prozac intake.
</P>
<P>
	   Arnold ordered DeAngelo committed to the custody of the state Department of
Mental Health for 45 days. After that time, a competency hearing will be held to
determine if he should be freed or remain institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
	   DeAngelo was taking Prozac to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, which a
psychiatric evaluation suggested may have been caused by Lyme disease.
