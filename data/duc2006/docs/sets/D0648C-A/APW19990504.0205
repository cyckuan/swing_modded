<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After arresting a man accused of  
supplying a handgun to student killers Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, detectives kept up their search for those who may have 
known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, 22, was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a  
handgun to a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He admits giving the weapon. He was horrified,'' Manes'  
attorney, Robert Ransome, told The Denver Post in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be  
used for, but Ransome said his client knew nothing of the impending 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris,  
18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a 
teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an eager  
but uneasy return to class at nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a  
16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure 
once you see all the police and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was  
released from jail after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance May  
10, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on 
charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and a shotgun -- 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are still trying to find others who may have known the  
killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a 
third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good  
possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the 
school that day,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and 
the TEC DC-9 pistol. It was not immediately clear which gunman 
obtained the weapon or when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, 
traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes could face stiffer charges if authorities conclude he knew  
of the gunmen's plans at the time he allegedly supplied the gun, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the  
anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. 
Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application 
for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly 
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to 
treat depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Students from both high schools shared Chatfield's building in  
shifts Monday, with Chatfield students attending classes in the 
morning and Columbine students in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend  
Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest 
of the year. The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis put the number of students affected at eight to 10, but  
said he did not know whether they were associated with the gunmen's 
clique known as the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators banned trench coats at every school in Jefferson  
County, which has 89,000 students.
