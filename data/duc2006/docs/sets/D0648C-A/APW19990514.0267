	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Midnight couch potatoes take heart:  
Television's glut of half-hour ads for food dehydrators, countertop 
broilers and exercise videos will soon be joined by an infomercial 
about Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly and Co. has created a 30-minute program on the world's  
top-selling antidepressant. It will air on TV stations and cable 
channels in the middle of the night and on weekends, time slots 
when more depressed people are expected to be slouched in front of 
the tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Americans pay about $60 a month for Prozac, which  
treats depression, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other 
ills. Its side effects include sexual dysfunction and 
sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
	The infomercial, which begins airing Monday, is aimed mostly at  
women, with all but two patients featured being female. It includes 
shaky camera shots of people who are presumably depressed and 
testimonials from people who have benefited from Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gives us an opportunity to tell people about a  
disease that really goes under-reported or undertreated,'' said the 
infomercial's host, Freda Lewis-Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug generates nearly $3 billion in annual sales for  
Indianapolis-based Lilly.
