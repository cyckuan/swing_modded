   Q. Do animals get bored?
</P>
<P>
   K.M., Haydenville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, according to Dr. Nicholas Dodman of the Tufts University
School of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may not like to give it the human word ``boredom.''
But it is. The animals are finding something else to do when they
aren't stimulated or can't do what they are programmed
instinctively to do.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman cites several examples. ``Horses have what are called
`stall vices,' things they do when they're stuck in their stall for
hours with nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He says 25-35 percent of horses do something called cribbing,
grasping a solid surface like their hay bucket or stall door in
their teeth and pulling backwards on it. It causes air to move
around in their throats making a gulping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do it 600 times an hour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others pace circles into their stall floor. Some dig with their
hooves, sometimes holes up to their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs will chase their tails, chase shadows, leap into the air at
imaginary insects, gnaw on furniture. Many dogs with nothing to do
for hours will lick their paws excessively, causing sores called
licking granuloma. Some dogs gulp at the air ``until they look
inflated, like they ate a basketball,'' Dodman says. ``The air
eventually comes out both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bored cats will eat, as in chew AND swallow, non-food items,
like plastic shower curtains, running shoes, woolen objects. Bored
Siamese cats are particularly known for a condition called ``wool
sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodman says monkeys in research facilities sometimes
self-mutilate, picking at their own skin until it bleeds. Bored
Macaque monkeys are known to do rectal probing. A gorilla at a
local zoo was pulling out his hair and eating it, making himself
vomit, behavior Dr. Dodman attributed to boredom. Polar bears in
zoos pace. One at the Bronx Zoo did the backstroke excessively in
its pool. A Russian bear at the San Diego zoo started drinking
water out of its paw, something those animals don't normally do.
</P>
<P>
   Common anti-depressant drugs like Prozac, also used to treat
humans with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are sometimes
given to bored animals that have OCD-like behavior. It cured those
bears, Dr. Dodman said, and the gorilla, and prescribed properly
can also help house pets that have adopted compulsive behaviors
because of boredom.

<P>
   A couple of elementary corrections. A few weeks ago in a column
we labeled Uranium ``Ur.'' The symbol is ``U.'' And we said the
derivation of the name Hydrogen is from the Latin hudor, for water.
Hudor is Greek. Aqua is Latin. Mea culpa is oops, we messed up.
