SCIENTISTS CALL FOR END TO NEUROLOGY-PSYCHIATRY `DIVIDE'

   The turf battle between neurologists and psychiatrists has
historically been so intense that a medical official once said that
getting them ``to sit down together without police present was in
itself an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not really be necessary for law enforcement to intervene
between the two disciplines, but there is nevertheless a ``great
divide'' that must be closed if research and treatment are to
advance more quickly, says a group of Harvard scientists from both
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Tuesday in the journal Neurology,
researchers say the animosity of the past stems from a difference
of thinking about what causes disease _ the biology of the brain
vs. the psychiatry of the mind. But the latest science shows
biological aspects to psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric
aspects to neurological disorders, according to the article by
neurologists Bruce H. Price and Raymond D. Adams, and psychiatrist
Joseph T. Coyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two disciplines working together gives far more hope than
continuing these old turf wars,'' said Price, chairman of the
department of neurology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., in an
interview. Price, the lead author, is also on the staff of
Massachusetts General Hospital and the faculty of Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   The article, meant to stir controversy and debate among the
nearly 13,000 members of the American Academy of Neurology, calls
for changes in the medical education of both neurologists and
psychiatrists, and for better academic leadership in encouraging
collaboration between the two disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has one of the highest per capita concentrations
of neurologists in the country, with nearly 10 members of the
neurology academy for every 100,000 people, according to the
academy's Web site, making it particularly noteworthy that the
article in Neurology is authored by Massachusetts scientists, Price
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neurology, as a practice, involves the study and treatment of
diseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological
disorders, while psychiatry looks at ailments like depression,
schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been cross-fertilization in the two
disciplines, with such recent subspecialties as biological
psychiatry and neuropsychiatry, and with the National Institute of
Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases
and Stroke making multidisciplinary grants.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed new Neuroscience Center at the National Institutes of
Health is expected to tie together neuroscience research being
conducted at NIMH, NINDS and seven other institutes.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists in the field said there needs to be even more
such collaboration, and welcomed the article in the journal
Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree wholeheartedly with everything in it,'' said Dr. Robin
Brey, chairwoman of the American Academy of Neurology's
professional and public information committee. The ``most important
point about this article,'' she said, is its summary of the latest
evidence that allows doctors to ``refine our viewpoints, update our
viewpoints and our theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence cited in the article for making the case that
the biology of the brain and psychiatry of the mind are
inseparable: Brain imaging scans that allow researchers to see
differences in people with and without mental illness; studies of
the amazing plasticity of the brain, with neurons growing in
response to environmental stimuli, like learning; and brain imaging
research showing that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder who
respond to either behavioral therapy or medication both show the
same biologic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brain vs. mind. . .it used to be either/or, nature or nurture.
What we're saying is it's really both,'' said Price.
