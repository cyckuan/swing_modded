<HEADLINE> Russia Attempts Submarine Rescue  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more
than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a
submarine crippled by a major collision. The chance of a happy
ending, the navy chief conceded, was ''not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear submarines, was
apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of
feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on Sunday, naval
commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said. It had been taking part
in naval exercises off the country's north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear
weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the
reports of serious damage raised concerns about a possible
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past,
according to reports. But the Pentagon said Monday no U.S. ship or
submarine was involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Russian ships were in the area where the submarine went
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' the navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was examined by a bell-shaped deep-water apparatus
late Monday and a decision on how to conduct a rescue would likely
be made Tuesday, according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ITAR-Tass new agency said the outside inspection of the vessel
did not support Adm. Kuroyedov's version of a collision. It quoted
an expert involved in the operation as saying the submarine could
have been damaged by a blast in its bow which caused the torpedo
section to fill with water.
</P>
<P>
   A team of ship designers was rushed to the area to help suggest
ways to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the crew was unknown. The navy said at first
that it was in radio contact with the submarine, but later admitted
that there was only ''acoustic contact'' that could be the noise of
crewmen pounding on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain
submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. Nuclear submarines
depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was
free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was
trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet
down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the
crushing water pressure. Various Russian reports said the submarine
was 330 to 510 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration
''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we can offer is
available.'' He said national security adviser Sandy Berger
reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian officials.
''At this point there's been no request for our assistance,''
Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Oscar-class submarine was
not carrying nuclear weapons. The Kursk is designed to carry 24
nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface
vessels such as aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Western military analysts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war. I would
be surprised if they had gone to sea without something,'' said Paul
Beaver, a British analyst.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the
vessel's two nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the
submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then
you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of
radioactive leakage,'' said Lionel Trippett of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no
sign of a radiation leak, said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Karsten Klepsvik.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the
official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing
people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set
procedure. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue
vessels, according to standard naval reference works.
</P>
<P>
   The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in
the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes,
which would be very dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when
trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the
Norwegian environmental group Bellona, which closely monitors
Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, launched in 1995, carries 107 personnel and weighs
some 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, an
authoritative guide to warships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.
</P>
<P>
   In the last major accident involving one of Moscow's nuclear
submarines, the Komsomolets sank in April 1989 after catching fire
200 miles north of Norway. Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors
aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor
still lies on the sea bottom.
