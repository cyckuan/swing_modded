<HEADLINE> Putin Orders Salvage of Sunken Sub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin has decided to go forward
with an operation to retrieve the bodies of 118 crewmen who died
aboard a nuclear submarine that sank in the Barents Sea, Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent reports had said that the proposed operation was
being delayed because of disputes over financing, but Klebanov said
after meeting with Putin that contracts have been drafted and are
expected to be signed within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore,
whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk
after Russian efforts failed for days. The amount of the contracts
was not immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   The retrieval effort is expected to take place in October or
November, Klebanov said, according to the news agency Interfax. The
Kursk sank on Aug. 12 after massive explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts shattered the submarine so severely that divers are
unlikely to be able to retrieve the remains of sailors who were in
the first four of the Kursk's nine compartments, Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also has ordered that an operation be conducted to raise
the wreck of the Kursk from its resting place 350 feet below the
surface, Klebanov said. That effort is expected to start next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax said the cost of raising the wreck is estimated at $45
million. No contracts have been signed for the salvage operation,
but Klebanov said the work will most likely include Dutch and
Belgian companies, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosions has not been determined. Russian
officials say they are focusing on indications that the Kursk
collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says two of its submarines were monitoring the
naval exercises in which the Kursk was taking part but denies that
either was involved in a collision.
