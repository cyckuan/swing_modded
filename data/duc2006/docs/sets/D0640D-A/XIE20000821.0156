<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Open Inner Hatch of Russian Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers opened the inner
hatch of the sunken Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk's
ninth unit at about 1 p.m. Moscow time (0900 GMT) Monday, Russian
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Navrotsky said that the unit was filled with water. They are
now considering the possibility of examining the unit with a video
camera, Interfax quoted spokesman for the Northern Fleet Vladimir
Navrotsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
If it is established that air remains there, the government
commission, operating on the Pyotr Veliky cruiser, will decide
what divers should do next, Itar-Tass said, citing Russia's
Northern Fleet press service.
</P>
<P>
The operation is supervised by commander-in-chief of the
Russian navy Vladimir Kuroyedov and the head of the government
commission, Deputy Premier Ilya Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
The press service stressed that the British LR-5 mini-submarine
cannot dock with the upper escape hatch. Therefore, it will not be
lowered to the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Norwegian divers opened the emergency hatch
of Kursk's ninth compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT),
and nobody was found in the docking area, which is flooded,
Russian Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov told the RTR
state television.
</P>
<P>
Experts said if the valve to the inner hatch is opened, that
would mean that hatch is also flooded. That scenario would most
probably prevent any attempt to get anybody out alive.
</P>
<P>
Measurements by the divers showed that there is no radiation
danger inside the ninth section of the Russian submarine.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of
the Barents Sea on August 12. Russian authorities said most of
those aboard probably died within minutes when the accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
With the sub stranded at 100 meters undersea for more than a
week, hopes are getting dim for finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the divers located some spaces that are not filled
with water, but the pressure in those air pockets might just be
too high to sustain human life.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.
