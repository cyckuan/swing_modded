<HEADLINE> Russians To Cut Submarine Open  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wants to begin efforts to recover the
bodies of 118 men who died aboard the sunken nuclear submarine
Kursk in September by cutting holes in the vessel's hull, Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov, chairman of the commission investigating the Aug. 12
disaster when the submarine sank after shattering explosions,
rejected reports that the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo
that used a liquid fuel system that some officers considered
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large
object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine,
but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside
the submarine misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no new torpedoes on the submarine,'' Klebanov said
after a commission meeting in St. Petersburg. He said the torpedoes
aboard had been used for 20 years, although he added they had been
fitted with a new model of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the commission, after considering several methods
of recovering the bodies, would recommend to President Vladimir
Putin that the work be done by cutting holes in the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, that work could begin in late September and would
by done by diver teams of two Russians and one Norwegian, Klebanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Spassky, head of the Rubin submarine design bureau, which
designed the Kursk, told the NTV television channel that the method
would ''enable the divers to freely get into every compartment of
the submarine and evacuate the bodies to accompanying vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov also said the commission would give Putin a proposal on
Wednesday for lifting the huge submarine to the surface, but he
provided no details other than to say the project would take about
a year and cost about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just removing the bodies would cost $5-7 million, Klebanov said.
Even the smaller amount is a severe expense for the cash-strapped
government, but Putin is under strong public pressure to recover
the remains for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's government was sharply criticized for its handling of
the disaster and its delay in accepting offers of help in the
rescue effort from Norway and Britain. Family members have said
some of the crew could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said medical experts should be able to identify the
victims even if they were burned in the blast and have deteriorated
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always a number on each crewman's clothing to
identify him,'' said navy Capt. Dmitry Litovkin, a military
commentator for the armed forces' newspaper Red Star.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to say whether the bodies are whole, but medical
experts will be able to recognize them,'' Litovkin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, other experts contend that the force of the blast would
have mutilated the bodies, and any remains would be carried away by
sea currents or eaten by fish and plankton.
</P>
<P>
   The Stolt Offshore oil services company, a Norwegian company
that sent divers to the Kursk, is negotiating with the Russians to
raise the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also considered cutting the submarine into
segments or raising it with pontoons, but that could set off any
weapons still on the submarine or damage its two nuclear reactors.
Russian and Western officials have said they have detected no
radiation leaks so far.
