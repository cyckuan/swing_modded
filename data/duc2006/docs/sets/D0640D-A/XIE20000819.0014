<HEADLINE> UK Rescuers Arrive, Submarine Crew Survival Hope Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British rescuers arrived Saturday
evening in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118
crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are
very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill-fated Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand
Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts by Russian rescuers have failed.
</P>
<P>
Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian
rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the
cripple Kursk is lying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the
submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency
escape hatch, may be flooded.
</P>
<P>
That statement implies that there is little chance to save any
of the submariners aboard.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Navrotsky, head of the Northern Fleet's press service,
said special rescue devices in the ninth compartment had been
damaged.
</P>
<P>
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but
Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said there
were two possible versions.
</P>
<P>
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on
collision with another object. The second is an explosion inside
the submarine with subsequent flooding of the sub's first and
second compartments.
</P>
<P>
The third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War II
mine, the admiral said. The final suggestion should not be
completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in
that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Motsak said earlier Saturday that "we have crossed the critical
guaranteed life support limit that we had set for the personnel in
the guidance manuals."
</P>
<P>
"A critical situation for the crew has apparently begun," he
said. "No matter how hard it is to say, we have to state the worst
expectations."
