<HEADLINE> Britain to Continue to Rescue Russian Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain plans to continue its bid
to reach and rescue the 118 Russian sailors in a sunken submarine
even though virtually all hope of finding survivors has faded,
British Defence Ministry said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said British and Russian naval officers are
liaising on how to mount a last-ditch rescue attempt after a
British team with a manned mini-submarine arrived at the scene at
1600 GMT and reported weather conditions to be "almost perfect"
for their mission.
</P>
<P>
But Vice-Admiral Mikhail Motsak, the head of Russia's Northern
Fleet, said earlier that there is now virtually no hope of any
survivors among the 118 crewmembers on board the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, there was no hope that normal air pressure
had been maintained in the rear sections - SOS signals hammered
out by sailors trapped there soon after the accident indicated
water had broken through.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether the British team will be given the
chance to make a rescue attempt before a decision is taken by the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
Commander Alan Hoskins, who is organizing the British effort at
the scene, said they would continue offering assistance until the
Russians told them to stop.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts
to dock with the Kursk overnight. A spokesman said damage to the
escape hatch was proving "an insurmountable obstacle."
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said there is no reason to believe the
British mini-submarine and its crew, whose assistance was formally
requested on Wednesday, will perform any better.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy outlook, the British submarine's chief pilot,
Tim Heron, believes they may still be able to save lives with
their state-of-the art technology.
</P>
<P>
"(The British mini-submarine) can move like an underwater
helicopter, up and down, round about and backwards and forwards,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A second vessel carrying British and Norwegian divers is due to
arrive at the scene of the disaster on Sunday.
