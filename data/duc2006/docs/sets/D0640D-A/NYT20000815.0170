<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a
diving capsule Tuesday to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a
sunken Russian nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers aborted their first attempt to retrieve the sailors
because a storm prevented them from attaching the rescue capsule to
an escape hatch, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted navy officials as
saying. The rescuers made their second attempt during a break in
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors are trapped 354 feet below the surface of the
Barents Sea in the Arctic circle. Russian officials at first said
the submarine sank on Sunday, but according to news reports Tuesday
the accident occurred on Saturday _ meaning the supply of air for
the 116 sailors on board was even smaller than had been believed
originally. Officials said they did not know whether any crew
members had been killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, called the Kursk, is an Oscar II-class submarine
that was completed in 1994. It sank in international waters, about
35 miles from the coast. Besides torpedoes, it normally carries 24
missiles intended to destroy ships.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine plunged to the seabed during a naval exercise and
was badly damaged, officials have said. Itar-Tass reported that a
preliminary underwater investigation showed that an explosion had
probably damaged the bow of the submarine, causing the torpedo room
to flood.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was not carrying nuclear weapons, the navy said,
but was powered by two nuclear reactors, raising concerns about
possible radioactive contamination. But Russian officials said the
reactors had been turned off, and officials in Norway said a
scientific vessel in the area had detected no signs of a
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been pessimistic about the chances that the crew
of the submarine could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projection of possible consequences of the accident in the
Kursk for the lives of its crew remains extremely grave,'' the
Russian navy commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The crew has not been in radio contact with rescue ships since
the submarine sank. Survivors have been communicating by tapping on
the hull. Oxygen supplies were running low and were expected to run
out in about two days, said one of the submarine's designers,
according to the Russian news agency Interfax. But that projection
was made before it became clear Tuesday that the submarine went
down on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier efforts to hook lines to the submarine to bring it air
and fuel had failed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry of Norway said Tuesday that it had received
a report from Russia saying the accident occurred Saturday and that
the Kursk was found on Sunday. No explanation was given for why the
information was only made public on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that the Russians had informally approached NATO
officials to ask about the possibility of assistance.
