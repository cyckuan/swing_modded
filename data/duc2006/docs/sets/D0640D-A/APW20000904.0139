<HEADLINE> General: Other Ship Part Near Kursk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers
located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that
resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy
spokesman denied any such discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov offered no evidence for the claim,
which he said supported the theory that a collision with a foreign
vessel caused the explosions that killed the Kursk's 118-man crew
Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered
the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being
guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. He did not say when
or how it was located or give other details, according to Russian
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The chief spokesman for the Northern Fleet, Vladimir Navrotsky,
said no such object was found when the Kursk was studied last week,
according to the Russian news web site Gazeta.ru.
</P>
<P>
   The navy press office could not be reached for comment Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the two explosions remains unclear. Military
officials claim the most likely scenario is that the Kursk struck
another vessel, probably a foreign submarine. The U.S. and British
navies have denied any collision, and the Russians have offered no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers blame an internal malfunction and explosion in
the submarine's torpedo compartment. Russian officials have also
not ruled out that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.
