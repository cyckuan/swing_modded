   WASHINGTON _ Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with
the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly
pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed
evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The other submarine was the Memphis, a nuclear-powered attack
submarine based in Groton, Conn., and one of two American
submarines spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years
when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Memphis reached Bergen, Norway, officials in
Russia had said that the Kursk probably had sunk after colliding
with either a foreign submarine or a World War II mine.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Pentagon still refuses to comment on the
whereabouts or the mission of the Memphis, but some officials now
acknowledge its spying mission.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that the Memphis was not damaged and that no other
submarine was involved in any collision. The Memphis' arrival in
Norway was a long-scheduled liberty call, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The call allowed the submarine to unload sonar tapes and other
recordings that the Americans say captured two explosions that
ravaged and sank the Kursk, killing all 118 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Those tapes, being analyzed at the National Maritime
Intelligence Center in Suitland, Md., contain the strongest
evidence to support the leading American theory of what destroyed
the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   And that theory, they said, does not include the collision that
the Russians have said probably occurred. ``We have subs that hear
everything that goes on,'' a senior officer said. ``It's pretty
clear to us what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo
being loaded or launched as part of an exercise misfired, its
engine or its fuel exploding. After 2 minutes and 15 seconds _
during which time the Kursk's captain either increased power from
the nuclear reactor or blew ballast in an effort to surface _ a
powerful explosion of the torpedo's warhead tore a gaping hole in
the submarine's bow, killing most if not all of the crew instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, Russia, a former submarine officer who is a
member of a governmental commission investigating the explosion
said Monday that a new weapons system was being tested on the
Kursk. But the former officer, Sergei Zhekov, would not elaborate
during a news conference about the system, saying that it was a
state secret, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kursk sank, the United States knew about it within
hours. The Americans collected telltale recordings from submarines,
a surface ship and even from shore. They detected no sounds of a
collision. And they monitored the Russian fleet's emergency radio
transmissions closely in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two submarines, the Navy had also sent a surface
ship to the Barents, the Loyal. The Loyal is part of a class of
surveillance ships that are operated by civilian contractors, but
include as many as 15 Navy seamen and officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Navy, ships like the Loyal have only a single
mission: ``to gather underwater acoustical data'' in support of
``the anti-submarine warfare mission'' of fleet commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the explosions, the two American submarines
radioed messages back to fleet headquarters. ``They were alive and
well and had no bumps,'' another senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a tea cup was rattled,'' the senior military officer said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American officials, neither the two submarines
nor the Loyal detected any sounds that would suggest the Kursk had
been involved in a collision of any sort. Even at great distances,
the signals created by a collision or an explosion are easy to
distinguish, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Kursk sank, Russian accounts of what happened
have been imprecise and sometimes contradictory. Officials in
Russia did not report the accident until early Aug. 14, which was a
Monday, a day after they realized something went wrong and nearly
two days after it happened. Even then they said that the accident
had happened on Sunday, rather than on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians do not deny that a major explosion hit the Kursk.
But they have insisted that the submarine first was involved in a
collision with some huge object, possibly a submarine or a World
War II mine.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and submarine experts said it was possible
that some of the crew _ perhaps 15 men or more _ survived the
initial explosions if they managed quickly to shut the watertight
doors to their compartments.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians said that they had detected tapping sounds from
within the Kursk at least two days after it sank, raising hopes
that a rescue of some crewmen might be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials said that neither the Loyal nor the
American submarines detected the sounds, though they might not have
been able to do so if they were too far away.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans had a fair guess of what happened to the
Kursk early on, it was only after the Memphis unloaded its sonar
tapes on Aug. 18 that officials began to offer the theory of the
misfiring of the torpedo missile.
</P>
<P>
   While the submarine's sonar equipment allowed the crew to
distinguish the explosions, a closer analysis of the recordings had
to wait until the tapes reached shore.
</P>
<P>
   But how much the Pentagon will be prepared to say in public
remains in question.
