<HEADLINE> Nuke Sub Sunken After Collision With Big Object: Russian Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object
caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the
incident, told reporters that the disaster with the sub "was
developing two minutes," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All efforts to evacuate the 118 submariners aboard the ill-
fated Kursk have so far bore no result, but the rescue operation
is continuing with 22 surface ships at the site of the accident.
</P>
<P>
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine
from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be trying to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard
the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that
prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities
oxygen could last until next week.
</P>
<P>
In live footage from the scene, the RTR television showed
improved weather and calmer sea, but the underwater currents
remain very strong, which, coupled with near-zero visibility, has
hampered the rescue vessels' repeated attempts to dock with sub.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and
that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. Radiation
levels are also normal.
</P>
<P>
Kursk was participating in exercises of the Russian Northern
Fleet when disaster struck, reportedly on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dyagalo
as saying that the sub is slowly sinking deeper into the seabed,
although the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules
are trying to attach, remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working
deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Navy
press service said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and
Norway in the rescue bid. It had earlier refrained from seeking
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers
from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the
site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue
craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors
and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov did not specify what kind of object that submarine had
hit, but Eduard Baltin, an ex-commander of the Black Sea Fleet,
speculated Wednesday that the Kursk must have collided with a
surface vessel.
</P>
<P>
Baltin said that the Kursk submarine must have been rising to a
periscopic level at between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. Moscow time
(0700 and 0745 GMT) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Kursk is an ocean submarine, whose systems function
perfectly at great depths. But at a depth of 100 meters, the
submarine's hydro-acoustic system may have failed to spot an
approaching surface ship," Baltin said.
