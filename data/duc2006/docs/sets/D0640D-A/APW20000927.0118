<HEADLINE> Russia To Get Help With Submarine  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help
retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear
submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is overseeing the
salvage mission, told lawmakers that a contract would be initialed
Saturday with a Norwegian company. He did not name the company.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said the retrieval work would begin before Oct. 10, and
could be finished next month. But he cautioned that the operation
would be complex ''because sections one through five (of the
submarine) are just heaps of metal,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   While Klebanov wouldn't name the company that will help Russia
do the work, he said it was not Norway's Stolt Offshore. A deal
with Stolt had been expected, but reportedly fell through over the
amount of the fee.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper Kommersant, Stolt Offshore wanted $12
million but Russia offered $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Russian divers don't have the equipment or the training to
conduct the operation alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank in the Barents
Sea during exercises Aug. 12. The cause of the accident has not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ship Mstislav Keldysh arrived at the scene of the
disaster on Tuesday, carrying Mir deep water capsules to examine
the submarine. The capsules have been used previously to inspect
the Titanic.
