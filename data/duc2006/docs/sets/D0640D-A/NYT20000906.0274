U.S. REPORTEDLY GAVE RUSSIA INFORMATION ON SUB THAT SANK 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's national security adviser,
Samuel Berger, has provided his Russian counterpart with a written
summary of what U.S. naval and intelligence officials believe
caused the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk to sink last month in
the Barents Sea, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The summary, based on acoustic recordings and other information
gathered by two U.S. submarines and a surface vessel in the Barents
at the time, included evidence that U.S. officials have said
contradicts assertions by some Russian officials that the Kursk
sank after a collision with another submarine or a World War II-era
mine.
</P>
<P>
   Berger provided the information, at the Russians' request, in a
meeting on Monday with Sergei Ivanov, head of the Russian Security
Council and a close aide to President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The information could help Putin's government sort out which of
several accounts was the most likely explanation for the sinking on
Aug. 12 that killed all 118 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to a request from the Russian government, Mr.
Berger provided some information to Mr. Ivanov on our knowledge
regarding the tragedy,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened his meeting with Putin on Wednesday in New York
with a discussion of the Kursk's sinking. The presidents were at
the world leaders' meeting at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton expressed his regret and his sympathies to
the families, of course,'' said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott afterward. ``And President Putin talked a bit about the
episode itself and what it revealed and how he had coped with it.
There was some further discussion on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to share information on the Kursk was unusual,
given the fact that it was gathered by one of the most secretive
parts of the U.S. military, the submarine fleet. Crowley declined
to discuss what information was shared, except to say that it was
in an unclassified form.
</P>
<P>
   But Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, quoted Ivanov as saying
the information included technical details on ``the exact times, to
the second, of two explosions'' that wracked the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the explosions _ recorded by the
Memphis, another U.S. submarine reported to be the Toledo and a
surveillance ship, the Loyal _ strongly suggest that the Kursk sank
after a catastrophic accident in its hull and not because of a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Following that theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo being loaded
or launched as part of an exercise misfired, with its engine or its
fuel exploding. Two minutes and 15 seconds later, a larger
explosion of the torpedo warhead tore a gaping hole in the sub's
bow.
