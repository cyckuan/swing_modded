<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts Continue for Russian Sub Despite Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Intensive efforts continued
Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk
nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All previous attempts to dock a rescue capsule to the sub have
failed and a seventh attempt was under way early Friday, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting Russian Northern Fleet
spokesman Igor Babenko.
</P>
<P>
The failures were blamed on a strong undercurrent and poor
visibility.
</P>
<P>
Babenko said four docking attempts were made on Thursday but
none of succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Docking attempts will continue until the arrival of foreign
rescuers expected Saturday evening and Sunday. Two Norwegian ships
are heading for the disaster area one the British LR5 submarine
rescue craft and the other a group of Norwegian deep-sea divers.
</P>
<P>
The weather forecasting service says the weather is relatively
good on the coast with gushes of wind not exceeding 36 km/h and
visibility of 1-2 kilometers in some places marred by fog. The air
temperature is 6-11 degrees Centigrade, and the temperature of
seawater at the depth of 100 meters, where the submarine is lying,
3 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who leads a
government commission probing the incident, said Thursday night
that collision with a heavy object caused the Kursk nuclear
submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said the collision resulted in "a dreadful hole" in the sub
and that the disaster "was developing within two minutes," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sub fell to the seabed from a depth of 20 meters. When it
struck the sea floor, the submarine received a second blow,
Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It has
a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up
to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite"
cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for up to 120
days, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ships and other vessels are participating in the
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine
from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be lying low to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard
the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that
prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities
oxygen could last until next week.
</P>
<P>
The military said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and
that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. Radiation
levels are also normal.
