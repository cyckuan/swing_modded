RUSSIA'S THEORY ON SUBMARINE INCIDENT HAS A COLD WAR RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-SUBMARINE)

<P>
   Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank
after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the
kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on
more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged
into one another.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the
collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view,
amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy subs
quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged
after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank,
the Russian navy contends.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied that any American
submarine collided with the Kursk, which plunged to the seabed on
Aug. 12. An intense rescue operation ended on Monday when the
Russians concluded that all 118 sailors had died in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in
the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included
the Kursk. But they have said that neither submarine was close to
the Russian vessel. British officials also denied any involvement
on Monday, saying they had no submarines in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War ended, the tenor of the cat-and-mouse game,
in which the submarines chased one another to test the other side's
capabilities, has grown less aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   American officials even called Russian leaders to apologize
shortly after each of the last two collisions occurred, in the
early 1990s. And given the West's efforts to support democracy in
Russia, some naval experts said they could not conceive of a
situation in which American or British officials would attempt to
cover up a tragic accident now.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Friedman, an independent navy expert in New York, said
that he believes the Russian naval officials were trying to deflect
the blame for their own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the evidence that has surfaced so far, he said it
seemed ``incredibly unlikely'' that the Kursk had suffered a
collision, especially with a foreign submarine. ``There are so many
other possibilities that you would have to rule out before you
focused on something as strange as that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American navy officials and several experts like Friedman have
said that it was more likely that the Kursk sank after one of its
weapons, like a torpedo, exploded on board.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Russian navy leaders also have cited the
possibility of a torpedo accident. There also was a chance, they
said, that the Kursk could have struck a floating mine left over
from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But time after time, several Russian officials have brought up
the idea of a collision with a Western sub. And the Russian defense
minister, Igor Sergeyev, said on Monday that a commission of
experienced navy officials had endorsed this view.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn
that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of
a large underwater object ``equivalent in size'' to the Kursk. But
he said a ship designed to survey the seabed could not find this
object later.
</P>
<P>
   Former submariners say that many of the collisions have occurred
because submarines have to navigate by interpreting sounds filtered
through their sonar equipment. When two boats get close to each
other, even a small mistake by one in plotting the other's course
can cause them to collide.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the collisions during the Cold War, the Western and
Russian subs sustained only minor damage, like scratched hulls. The
Western subs generally were under orders to remain undetected, so
they never surfaced to try to aid the Soviet vessels.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the Tautog, a nuclear-powered
attack submarine, collided in 1970 with a Soviet submarine close to
Russia's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet vessel, which was also operating under nuclear power,
sustained so much damage, former American officials have said, that
it was reported to President Nixon that the submarine had sunk. It
was only in recent years that enough information became available
in Russia to determine that while the submarine was severely
damaged, it had limped back to port.
</P>
<P>
   The last collisions between American and Russian subs occurred
in 1992 and 1993. In a break from Cold War secrecy, both the Bush
and Clinton administrations disclosed the accidents publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance
missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater
distances from Russian vessels.
