MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Russian nuclear submarine that
was stranded on the bottom of Barents Sea may have become partly
filled with water, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.

<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk," which was on a training mission as
part of Russian Northern Fleet's regular exercises, failed to
respond to radio signals at a predetermined time. Communications
with crew members were re-established later, Interfax said,
quoting the Russian Navy press service.

<P>
The submarine's atomic power plant has been taken off line and
is under control with radiation at normal levels, the press
service said.

<P>
According to the independent NTV channel, there are no lights
aboard the submarine and there could be problems with air supply
following the shutdown of the nuclear power reactors.

<P>
"Kursk" remains on the Barents Sea floor, where the sea is
about 100 meters deep. Three submarines and five submersible
attack vessels have come to its rescue.  Northern Fleet
Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov is overseeing the rescue
operation, which is aimed at raising the submarine to the surface
and evacuating its crew.

The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700 - 23,860 tons and can dive to depths
of up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. It can operate autonomously for up to
120 days and carries a 107-man crew, Interfax said.

<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last
Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the
versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet,
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, which involved 20 warships, submarines and
auxiliary vessels and 10 coast units, were scheduled to end on
Sunday.
