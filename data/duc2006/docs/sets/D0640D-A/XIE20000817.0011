<HEADLINE> Russian, NATO Officials Discuss Submarine Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian naval officer
said here Thursday that the 118 sailors on board the stricken
Kursk submarine could survive for two more weeks before their
oxygen runs out.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Naval Vice Chief of Staff Alexander Pobozhy, head of a
visiting Russian delegation, told a meeting of NATO delegates that
in an incident some years ago when a Soviet submarine sank,
survivors were found after three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience with the Soviet submarine forces, it can
be as long as two to three weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the
western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a
nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
The 14,000-ton Kursk has been stranded about 107 meters below
the Barents Sea since last Saturday after a major disaster --
thought to have been caused by a collision or an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescue efforts have failed so far and Russia has
accepted offers of help from Britain and Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Britain and Norway are sending personnel to the
accident site. A British rescue submarine and back-up staff were
flown to Norway Wednesday en route to the tragic spot. Norway said
it would send up to 15 divers from its offshore oil and gas
industry.
</P>
<P>
But the rescue submarine and divers are not expected to be in
the position until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said further offers of help could involve rescue
equipment and equipment to deal with the medical aftermath, such
as decompression chambers.
</P>
<P>
World reaction showed that hopes of finding any of the Kursk
crew alive are fading after tapped SOS signals stopped on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said Thursday's meeting between Russians and
NATO delegates in Brussels include a telephone link-up with
British submarine rescue experts in Morthwood, England, and a
wider discussion about the angle at which the Kursk was lying on
the seabed, the water and the weather conditions, and other
organizational and technical matters.
