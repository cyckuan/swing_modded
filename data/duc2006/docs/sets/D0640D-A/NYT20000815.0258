 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said. edo chamber, which contains warheads, would probably have
caused extensive casualties, analysts said. Navy officials said
casualties could not be ``ruled out,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were floodeds that can
be sealed off in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate
the submarine if several compartments, including the control
center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a teland also listing sharply to one
side. As a result, the capsules and other devices are sliding off
the vessel's hull, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailorsarked
all our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late
Saturday or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the
Russian fleet, was commissioned only five years ago and
representssia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to
the environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the
reactor that powers its engines had been shut down. Officials in
Norway said there was no sign of a radiation leak.
