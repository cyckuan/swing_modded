<HEADLINE> Final Moments of a Doomed Submarine  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms
standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the
breeze, the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea, a
symbol of Russian power and pride.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time anyone on land would see the
nuclear-powered warship that the Russian navy boasted was
unsinkable. As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the
Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was named after the region in southern Russia where
Soviet troops in 1943 turned the tide against Nazi Germany's army
in the biggest tank battle in history. Like the old land battle,
the Kursk was intended to turn the tide at sea if there was ever
another world war.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was a 500-foot-long underwater missile base. Its
sides bristled with 24 silos, each housing a cruise missile capable
of slamming a nuclear warhead at supersonic speed into a target
hundreds of miles away. The submarine and a dozen like it were
designed during the Cold War to destroy the U.S. Navy's aircraft
carriers with swarms of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War ended a decade ago and the Kursk's nuclear warheads
were locked up ashore. The Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia
was falling apart, sinking deeper into poverty and backwardness.
</P>
<P>
   With most of its warships too dilapidated to put to sea, the
navy staked what little money it had on keeping up the nuclear
submarine fleet -- a potent threat that the navies of the United
States and other Western nations could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was just five years old. The crew, nearly half of them
officers with advanced technical skills, had been hailed as the
navy's elite, a chosen few who could handle any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin had big plans for the navy and the
Kursk. The navy exercises that the Kursk sailed to join on Aug. 10
were a prelude for a major step in putting Moscow back on the world
stage: the return of a Russian fleet to the Mediterranean in 2001
for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises were big news. Russian television showed film of
the Northern Fleet in action, the hulking cruisers and nimble
destroyers cutting through the waves and warships firing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Aug. 14, a Monday, the navy announced that the Kursk had
experienced a malfunction. The situation was not critical -- the
submarine was in radio contact, air and power lines had been hooked
up and arrangements were being made to bring the crew up, the navy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting evidence suggests the crewmen were already dead and
almost every utterance by top officials about saving the Kursk
would turn out to be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was rising to the surface, possibly preparing to fire
a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck. Nothing is known about
what the crew was doing in those last few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian monitors later reported detecting an explosion in the
vicinity of the Kursk, followed within minutes by a much larger
blast that registered at 3.5 on seismic monitors, equivalent to a
small earthquake. All the signs suggest a problem in the torpedo
compartment at the front of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was carrying a new type of torpedo with a liquid
fuel system that some officers complained was unstable, according
to some reports. Or the young, inexperienced conscript sailors may
have fumbled one of the torpedoes or the test firing may have gone
wrong, the weapon jamming in a torpedo tube.
</P>
<P>
   The first blast must have convulsed the Kursk, knocking out
control systems and pitching it into a sharp dive toward the bottom
350 feet below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Crewmen would have been knocked sprawling as the submarine
plunged out of control. Officers in the command center would have
been shouting for reports, trying to determine what had happened.
Maybe there was time to hit the alarm system, but the whole crew
already knew they were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The first blast probably killed and injured some of the sailors.
Survivors would have been shouting for help, for first aid crews,
frantically trying to reach injured comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Plunging down at mounting speed and with the decks slanting
sharply forward, sailors would have been fighting to stay on their
feet or in their seats as the Kursk plunged into the depths. They
never regained control.
</P>
<P>
   A second, catastrophic explosion ripped through the Kursk,
probably as it slammed into the bottom. This blast was probably
torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating. Russia's navy
says it was about 2 tons of explosives going up; some officers say
it could have been more than 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The hull was twisted like a wet towel being squeezed dry.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was built of immensely strong steel to withstand the
enormous pressures of diving hundreds of feet. The hull would have
contained and intensified the explosion. Following the path of
least resistance, the blast ripped backward, breaking through the
thinner walls of the crew compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew were within yards of the blast. Navy officers
say that many were probably vaporized by the detonation; others
were ripped to bits.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody still alive after the second explosion was almost
certainly stunned, probably deafened and unconscious. Kursk's
nuclear reactors appear to have shut down, plunging the submarine
into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions ripped at least one large hole in the hull. Tons
of water surged in, quickly filling the submarine. Anyone who
survived the explosions almost certainly drowned, the navy says.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be an exact reconstruction of the last moments
of the Kursk. It did not have black boxes like those which can tell
what happened to a crashed airliner. Raising the Kursk may be
impossible, meaning that its secrets will be lost forever.
