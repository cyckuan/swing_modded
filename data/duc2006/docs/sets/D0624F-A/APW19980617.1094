Scotland Yard apologize to parents of slain black teenager 
</HEADLINE>

	   LONDON (AP) _ A senior Scotland Yard police officer Wednesday
apologized to the parents of a black teenager slain five years ago
in a race killing that has become the focus of debate over
relations between police and ethnic minorities.
	   Ian Johnston, assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner for
southeast London, told Neville and Doreen Lawrence that he ``could
not justify'' errors in the investigation into the stabbing and
death of Stephen Lawrence, 18, at a London bus stop on April 22
1993.
	   ``I wanted to say to you that I am truly sorry that we have let
you down. It has been a tragedy for you, you have lost a son and
not seen his killers brought to justice,'' Johnston told Mr.
Lawrence at a public inquiry into the teenager's death.
	   Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly
and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white
gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.
	   Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting
agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence.
A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law, also
collapsed.
	   Johnston said that the case had had a severe impact on police
relations with London-based black Britons, saying that the
inability to solve the case had been ``a tragedy for the
Metropolitan Police who have lost the confidence of a significant
section of the community for the way we have handled the case.''
