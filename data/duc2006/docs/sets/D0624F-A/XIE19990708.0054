LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank
Dobson vowed Wednesday to keep racism out of the health service
after reports that human organs had been donated on condition they
were given to white patients.
</P>
<P>
The reports cast a new cloud over race relations in Britain,
already strained after the police force was found to be racist
following its bungled investigation into the 1993 murder of black
youth Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"I have not been the opponent of the apartheid movement for the
whole of my adult life to see it introduced in the National Health
Service," Dobson said while touring a hospital outside London with
Prime Minister Tony Blair, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Dobson later told ITN television news he would introduce rules
preventing donors from choosing the race of the person to receive
their organs if rules were deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
"It had never occurred to me that a rule would be necessary to
keep racism out of blood transfusion and transplants," Dobson
said. "If it is necessary to introduce a rule, we'll introduce
it."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Dobson ordered an inquiry into a case revealed by
BBC television in which a donor's family told the Northern General
Hospital in the city of Sheffield last July that the recipient of
their relative's kidneys must be white.
</P>
<P>
Black Labor MP Bernie Grant, himself awaiting a kidney
transplant, condemned race-selective organ donations and called on
Dobson to get to the bottom of the case.
</P>
<P>
"It's an outrage of enormous proportions," Grant was quoted by
Reuters as saying. "It challenges the whole basis of the NHS as a
universal service in which black and white life is of equal
value."
</P>
<P>
"We were promised things would change and there wouldn't be the
official reluctance to stamp out racism there has been in the
past," Grant said. "It's up to Frank Dobson to take some urgent
disciplinary action and find who was behind this."
</P>
<P>
Race relations campaigners expressed outrage at the kidney
transplant report, with Assembly Against Racism spokesman Kumar
Mushid calling it "incomprehensible" for people engaging in an act
of humanity by allowing the use of an organ to be imposing racist
conditions on its use.
