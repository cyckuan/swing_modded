<HEADLINE> Britain Defends Racism Record  </HEADLINE>

   GENEVA (AP) -- Britain defended its record in fighting racism
before a U.N. panel Monday but conceded that the tone of the
country's recent asylum debate could provoke racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Britain ''remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is
seen as a tolerant and diverse society,'' British delegation leader
Sarah Marshall told the 18-member Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination. She noted that Britain received 71,160
asylum applications last year, up 55 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The increase comes among a recent focus on immigration by the
country's leading political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party has accused the Labor Party
government of making Britain a ''soft touch'' for migrants and
called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, hoping to deter asylum seekers, in March cut
cash grants previously paid to them. The government also said more
would be forced to settle outside London and announced heavy fines
for truckers caught smuggling illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 29 British rights organizations said the revised laws
create racial tensions rather than racial harmony. They claimed
Britain ''has failed to take adequate measures to protect the human
rights of ethnic minorities, leaving millions of people vulnerable
to discrimination, violence and social exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall conceded Monday that ''the tone of some debate around
asylum has led ... to incidents of racial harassment against
settled minority communities.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said asylum-seekers will be better off under new British
policy that clears up confusion and speeds up the processing of
asylum claims. A tough stance on illegal immigration helps
integrate legal migrants, she added.
</P>
<P>
   She said British authorities and police have learned from the
1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white
youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death
adequately. The killing prompted a national debate on racism and on
police handling of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst incidents of race-hate violence in recent years were
the Brixton and Soho nail bombs last year,'' Marshall said. ''They
were perpetrated by a loner who is now confined to a secure state
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to white supremacist David Copeland. Copeland
was given six life sentences in June for the 1999 bombing campaign
against minorities in London that killed three people and injured
more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. committee is meeting to review the records of some of
the 150 nations that are party to the 1969 International Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The
United States' race record is not among those being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Britain submitted a 72-page report to the panel, which is
expected to issue its conclusions Aug. 25.
