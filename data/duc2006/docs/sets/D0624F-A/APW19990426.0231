	LONDON (AP) -- One minority leader warned today that volunteers  
will begin patrolling Southall, a racially mixed south London 
district, to prevent further bombings by a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and other organizations have posted an $80,000 reward for  
the arrest of the neo-Nazis from Combat 18 who have been attacking 
minorities, most recently setting a bomb off Saturday that injured 
seven people in Brick Hall, a district in London's East End. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan police Assistant Commissioner David Vaness said  
police feared ``a continuing series of vicious attacks,'' possibly 
spreading to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Suresh Gover said 100 volunteers from the Southall Monitoring  
Project and local mosques and temples would patrol Southall next 
Saturday wearing distinctive armbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have suffered a long history of racial hostility ... but  
this is racial terrorism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group in the central England city of Leicester, the  
Montserrat Community Association, warned that vigilante groups 
might take to the streets if the attacks continue, the Times of 
London reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, in the second attack in eight days, a bomb exploded  
in Brick Lane, which has a high concentration of Bangladeshis. 
Combat 18 claimed responsibility for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was also among four far-right organizations that each  
claimed to have planted a nail bomb April 17 that injured 39 people 
in Brixton, a racially mixed south London neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the two attacks, both with crude nail bombs,  
appeared linked and were clearly racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, several black lawmakers reported receiving  
threatening letters signed by ``White Wolves,'' a name that has 
cropped up before under racist threats. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Sunday Telegraph reported that a 15-page document  
signed ``White Wolves'' and giving instructions on orchestrating a 
bombing campaign was faxed to a radio station a week before the 
Brixton bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Britain's largest Asian community newspapers also  
received a threatening letter from the ``White Wolves,'' its editor 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's state-funded Commission for Racial Equality said the  
bombings were a backlash against an official inquiry into the 
bungled police investigation of the fatal stabbing of a black 
London teen-ager in 1993. The report, released in February, said 
the London police force was riddled with racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Five white youths suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence have  
never been successfully prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Claude Moreas said far-right elements  
``don't like the idea of lifting the rock and seeing racism 
underneath.''
