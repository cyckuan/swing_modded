<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges Racist Reform After Lawrence Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
Tuesday promised new measures to combat racism in the wake of the
inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to
the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about
"real, practical change."
</P>
<P>
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling
of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who
was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east
London in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The new measures would focus on tackling "institutionalized
racism" in the police service, with a shake up of training and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
But Straw warned that the government had "serious reservations"
about proposals to allow prosecutions for racist offenses which
take place in private.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that changes to the double jeopardy principle,
whereby a defendant could not be tried for the same offense twice,
would be considered without any firm prospect of action.
</P>
<P>
The action plan aims to bring the police fully within the remit
of the Race Relations Act and states that all aspects of policing
will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he would lead a steering group including members
from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police
Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police
organizations and the Crown Prosecution Service to enact most of
the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that action to tackle racism must begin at the
earliest stage and be carried out across all agencies," he said.
