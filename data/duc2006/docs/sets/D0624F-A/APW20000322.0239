<HEADLINE> 100 Arrests Made in London Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police cracked down on racial intolerance,
arresting three men in connection with the 1993 killing of a black
teen-ager, and picking up 100 suspected racists in separate raids
around the capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, by a gang of white
youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately
prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Five white youths were identified as suspects after the April
1993 killing in east London. None has been successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family
appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with
information about the slaying to contact police. A third man was
arrested on Wednesday, and all three were released on police bail.
Their identities were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Police said none of the arrests resulted from the television
appeal, but that it had prompted more than 70 telephone calls, some
of which were useful.
</P>
<P>
   A separate series of police raids Wednesday resulted in the
arrest of 100 people on suspicion of offenses that included threats
to kill and racially aggravated criminal damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who,
because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and
destroy the principle of justice for all,'' said Detective Chief
Superintendent John Godsave.
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the arrests appeared to be linked to any
far-right racist group or the Lawrence case.
</P>
<P>
   A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police
institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a
more active role in combating racial intolerance. Wednesday's raids
stemmed from the work of units set up in June in each of the
capital's 32 boroughs to target those responsible for racist
crimes.
