<HEADLINE> London Police Criticized for "Inadequate" Race Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in England and Wales
were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a
government inspector's report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted
"institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following
the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is
room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's
author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20
recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need
to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his
report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
</P>
<P>
The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as
fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into
the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by
white youths in 1993. No-one has been convicted of the crime.
</P>
<P>
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden
anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing
methods.
</P>
<P>
Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable
to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are
brought under the Race Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon has revealed
plans to introduce tests for racism as well as launching a major
study of what the public look for from the police.
