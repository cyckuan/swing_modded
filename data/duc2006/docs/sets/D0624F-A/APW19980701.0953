Britain keeps entry ban on black leader Farrakhan

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Wednesday it plans to keep a 12-year
ban on Louis Farrakhan entering the country, but gave the militant
U.S. black leader a last chance to appeal despite his ``clearly
offensive'' views.
	   A government announcement said Home Secretary Jack Straw has
told Farrakhan that ``he is minded to maintain'' the ban.
	   ``Mr. Farrakhan now has the opportunity to make further
representations before the Home Secretary takes a final decision,''
the statement added.
	   Straw, in charge of immigration, had considered lifting the ban
after Farrakhan last month signed a pledge not to make attacks on
whites, Jews and homosexuals while in Britain. He also said he
recognized that under Britain's Race Relations Act it is an offense
to stir up racial antagonism.
	   However, Farrakhan's chance of an entry visa was apparently
dashed when 20 supporters of his Nation of Islam movement on Monday
disrupted an inquiry into the racially motivated murder of a black
teenager in London, Stephen Lawrence. They burst into the inquiry
room when five white suspects started testifying.
	   Lawrence's parents appealed to the militants not to disrupt the
inquiry.
	   The Home Office said Straw reached his decision after reviewing
the ban and ``recent events at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.''
	   Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said Farrakhan ``has clearly
offensive views.''
	   The Board of Deputies of British Jews also lobbied the
government to keep the ban, imposed when Farrakhan planned to visit
in 1986.
