<HEADLINE> UK Govt Rejects Resignation over Lawrence Blunder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government rejected
Calls on Friday for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the
publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case.
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister Paul Boateng denied that Straw or his
officials were to blame for the publication of witnesses' names
and addresses in appendices to the report on the police
investigation of the racist murder.
</P>
<P>
He told MPs that the chairman of the inquiry team, Sir William
Macpherson, had accepted full responsibility for the blunder.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a matter that cannot be put at the door of the
Home Office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several of the named informants are now under police protection
after their names were made public and the opposition Conservative
party MPs have called Straw to resign for the error.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of the report has been suspended and fresh copies
are to be published without the offending details.
</P>
<P>
Both Labor and opposition MPs expressed incredulity that the
Home Office did not remove the names from the document when it
received the report more than a week prior to publication.
