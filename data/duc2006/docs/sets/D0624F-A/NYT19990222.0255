REPORT FINDS LONDON'S POLICE FORCE `RIVEN WITH RACISM'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's
police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized
racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that
conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white
communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations
for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to
usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the
author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government
inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure
of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service
to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin''
reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which
amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance,
thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of
the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that
``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it
extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the
community in the way that policing by consent demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations were measures making individual
officers liable for legal judgments of up to $800,000 for racist
behavior, giving the Commission for Racial Equality statutory power
to investigate the police, making racist language even in private
conversations criminally punishable, changing the national schools
curriculum to emphasize cultural diversity and improve race
awareness and empowering the Court of Appeal to allow acquitted
defendants to be tried anew if compelling new evidence comes to
light.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection
against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to
the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old
Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history
of race baiting. Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a
widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the
subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks
and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances
to the way Lawrence was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police
ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month
period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play
based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is
playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is
moving to the West End in May.
</P>
<P>
   At many points in the lengthy proceedings, police witnesses
including Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner,
turned aside all references to the existence of institutional
racism on the force, the very characterization they are now being
told they must embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The official originally in charge of the Lawrence investigation,
deputy assistant police commissioner David Osland, said at the
time, ``The suggestion that any police officer would investigate a
murder less competently because the victim was black is an absolute
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the hearings, Lawrence's parents, Neville and
Doreen Lawrence, and others pursuing the case protested the choice
of Macpherson as chairman, saying he was insensitive to their needs
and perspectives. But on Monday there was praise and expression of
some astonishment at his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers,
said that Sir William had ``managed to grasp the nettle'' of
Britain's race relations. ``Our expectations were low, but if they
had been higher, this is the sort of thing we should have
expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jasper, director the black policy group The 1990 Trust,
said: ``We are very pleased. The report is full-blooded in its
criticism, and it does reflect, as far as we can see, the broad
concerns of the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ros Howells, a friend of the Lawrences, suggested that Sir
William had had his views changed dramatically by the evasive
testimony of police officers, which in their current staged
retelling, draw gasps of disbelief from theatergoers. ``He was
shocked during the inquiry by the incompetence of the police,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which has received praise from backers of the
Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism
on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication
of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw obtained a judicial order on Saturday
night forcing The Sunday Telegraph to drop an exclusive account of
the report in its early editions, then had to back down when other
papers protested the move.
