REPORT CITES INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IN LONDON POLICE

   LONDON _ The Metropolitan Police, whose friendly London
``bobby'' made it one of the most recognizable police forces in the
world, is institutionally racist, according to a British government
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the most comprehensive examination of race relations in
Britain in nearly 20 years, Sir William Macpherson, a retired
judge, concluded that the London police force is riven with
``pernicious and institutionalized racism,'' and that racism among
the police reflects a problem in the wider society.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the
800-page report by announcing a radical overhaul of the country's
racial discrimination laws, saying they would now apply to the
police and all government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A solemn Blair told the House of Commons Wednesday that the
report on racism was ``an important moment in the life of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still
exists in our society,'' Blair told lawmakers. ``It is a moment to
learn, to reflect and to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned after police botched the investigation
into the 1993 racially motivated murder of a black teenager,
Stephen Lawrence, has put pressure on Sir Paul Condon, the
Metropolitan Police chief, to resign. But Condon, whose seven-year
term expires in January, said he will not step down and the British
government issued a vote of confidence in him after the report was
released.
</P>
<P>
   According to British government sources, Condon saved his job by
accepting the findings of Macpherson's report, and especially by
accepting the sweeping new definition of institutional racism
issued by Macpherson.
</P>
<P>
   He defines it as ``the collective failure of an organization to
provide an appropriate and professional service to people because
of their colour, culture and ethnic origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the
police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated
racism.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where more than 20 percent of the residents are
minorities, only 2 percent of the police force is. Minorities make
up more than 5 percent of the population in all of Britain, but
less than 2 percent of all police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Lawrence, 18, has put police under scrutiny like
never before. But it has also touched off a wider national debate
about racism, and now brought about major reform.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who are natives
of Jamaica, gave the report a guarded welcome, though they said
they were disappointed it had not called for the prosecution of
five suspects in their son's murder for perjury. Three of the
suspects were acquitted in a civil prosecution brought by the
Lawrences, but the report calls for allowing even those acquitted
of crimes to be tried again if new compelling evidence emerges.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, who watched from the visitors' gallery in
Parliament as Home Secretary Jack Straw announced a series of
reforms, said they were heartened that Macpherson had declared that
institutional racism was a major problem in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, a lot of people are aware of the
situation,'' Neville Lawrence said at a news conference, urging
people to ``try and do some good in the name of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone and sweeping conclusions of Macpherson's report
surprised even civil rights campaigners who have long complained
that the British establishment is in denial about the extent of
racism in their country. When he was a High Court justice,
Macpherson had a reputation for being a conservative and part of
the very establishment he was asked to critique. Lawrence's parents
initially complained about his appointment to review the police.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticized Macpherson's report as being too sweeping in its
conclusions and more aimed at being sensitive to grievances of
minorities than providing realistic solutions to complex social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Broughton, chairman of the police federation of England and
Wales, which represents rank and file police officers, said he does
not believe the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist and
called Macpherson's report ``grossly unfair.'' He said the charge
of racism is being thrown around carelessly.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that some officers investigating the Lawrence
murder may have been insensitive to the victim's family, but added,
``There can be no justification for a blanket allegation that the
police did not care about this murder because the victim was
black.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, whose dignity and tenacity in demanding justice
has impressed many Britons, have repeatedly called for Condon to
step down, saying someone has to be accountable for the
incompetence and racial insensitivity by police that allowed their
son's killers to escape prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Straw, who is in charge of law enforcement, Wednesday backed
Condon as the ideal person to implement the 70 recommendations to
improve policing made in Macpherson's report. Straw ordered that
all unsolved murder cases in London be reopened. Some of those
murders are thought to be racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Condon accepted the findings, including
the new definition of institutional racism. He had previously
denied steadfastly that his force was institutionally racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Met feel a sense of shame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condon received bipartisan support in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hunt for scapegoats will help no one,'' said the opposition
leader, William Hague.
</P>
<P>
   While resigning from governmental posts for the errors of
subordinates has a long tradition in Britain, Condon said morale
within the force would collapse if he allowed himself to become a
scapegoat for the botched investigation and the bitterness it has
provoked among minorities. He said he made combating racism one of
his top priorities, devoted his first speech as chief to the
subject, and has doubled the number of minority officers on the Met
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Grant, one of the few blacks in Parliament, said the
report was a wakeup call for white Britons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last chance for British society to tackle
racism,'' he said, suggesting that failing to do so could
eventually lead to a repeat of the 1981 riots in Brixton, a black
section of London.
