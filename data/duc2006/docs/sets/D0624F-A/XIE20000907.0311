<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Launches Scholarship to Open up Architecture to Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Prince of Wales Thursday
launched a scholarship to try to open up architecture to the
ethnic minorities, in memory of the murdered black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
His Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment will
pay about 10,000 pounds (14,500 U.S. dollars) a year to fund an
ethnic minority student through architectural school, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
"How wonderful it would be if, through my foundation, we could
help to increase the proportion of black and ethnic minority
practitioners in the field of architecture," Prince Charles said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lawrence was cruelly robbed of the chance to develop
his potential talents in the field of architecture.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, who was studying for his A-levels when he was
murdered by racists in April 1993, had always wanted to be an
architect. He was on a work placement with a firm of architects.
</P>
<P>
The prince expressed his "deepest sympathy" to Stephen's
parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial
lecture in London.
</P>
<P>
"I wish them well in their quest to build something positive
from the shocking and sudden loss of their son Stephen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The memorial lecture will be an annual event aimed at
inspiring young black and Asian people.
