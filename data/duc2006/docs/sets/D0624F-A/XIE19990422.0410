<HEADLINE> Lawrence Family Launch Civil Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The parents of the murdered black
teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against
the men suspected of his killing.
</P>
<P>
They are also taking action against the Metropolitan Police
over the failed investigation into the murder. No one has been
convicted of the killing, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The move comes the day before the sixth anniversary of
Stephen's death and narrowly beats the six-year deadline for
launching civil actions.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes ahead, the five key suspects may be
cross-examined in a court for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Three of the suspects -- Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary
Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three
years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
This meant they could not face further criminal charges for the
murder.
</P>
<P>
The action against the police comes amid ongoing negotiations
with Scotland Yard over compensation.
</P>
<P>
The police have offered Lawrence's parents 50,000 pounds
(78,000 U.S. dollars) each for mishandling the investigation into
their son's murder in Eltham, south London in 1993.
