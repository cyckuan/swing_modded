Britain's top police chief apologizes to parents of slain black

	   LONDON (AP) _ The chief of Britain's largest police force
apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose
stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations
between police and minorities.
	   Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen
Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration''
directed at him.
	   ``I deeply regret that we have not brought Stephen's racist
murderers to justice and I would like to personally apologize again
today to Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence for our failures,'' Condon said,
from his seat a few feet away from Neville and Doreen Lawrence at a
public inquiry into the case.
	   ``We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a
central concern is that the Met is racist. I acknowledge that we
have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment,'' he
added.
	   Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus
stop by a group of white attackers.
	   The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and
incompetently in resolving the case. Two men were charged, but
prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the
case. A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law,
also collapsed.
	   The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign.
