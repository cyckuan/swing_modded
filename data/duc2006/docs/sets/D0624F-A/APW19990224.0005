<HEADLINE>  Britain Orders Reform of Race Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Declaring that the racially motivated killing of a  
black teen-ager shamed the nation, the British government today 
ordered a major overhaul of race laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The order followed today's release of an official report that  
said London's police force is riddled with racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still  
exists in our society,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told a hushed 
House of Commons. ``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government released the report of a judicial inquiry that  
said the police inquiry into the 1993 fatal stabbing of 17-year-old 
Stephen Lawrence was marked by ``professional incompetence and 
institutional racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five white youths suspected of killing Lawrence while he waited  
at a bus stop with a black friend have never been successfully 
prosecuted. All five denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister in charge of the  
police, announced that laws making racial discrimination an offense 
will be broadened to include the police and all government 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London  
and tighter disciplinary regulations for police. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, appeal judges may for the first time be empowered  
to permit suspects to be tried twice for the same offense if there 
is new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged  
again because they were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of Lawrence, whose Jamaican-born parents came to  
Britain 30 years ago, provoked a national debate. It has also come 
to epitomize what some see as underlying racism in a nation where 
race riots are rare and laws barring discrimination already are 
wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one reason for this murder. Stephen was  
black,'' Straw told lawmakers as the teen-ager's parents, Neville 
and Doreen Lawrence, watched from the visitors' gallery in the 
House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by retired judge Sir William Macpherson also said  
that an internal police inquiry into the handling of the Lawrence 
investigation was ``flawed and indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A section of the report, which had been leaked to the media  
earlier, said London's overwhelmingly white Metropolitan police 
force was plagued by ``institutional racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be seen, or detected in processes, attitudes and  
behavior which amounts to discrimination ... which disadvantages 
ethnic minority people,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw said Lawrence's killing and its repercussions had given  
whites -- 93 percent of the population -- a look at what it is like 
to be black or Asian in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the truths are uncomfortable,'' said Straw, adding he  
wanted the report to be a catalyst for irrevocable change 
nationwide.
