<HEADLINE> British Police Launch Crackdown on Racist Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British police launched a series
of crackdown on "hated crime" across the capital on Wednesday,
arresting some 70 suspected racists.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena,
a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Those taken for questioning were alleged to have committed
offenses ranging from the publication of racist material to
racially aggravated assaults.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who,
because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and
destroy the principle of 'Justice for All'," said Detective Chief
Superintendent John Godsave, who headed the operation.
</P>
<P>
Godsave said the raid, in all 32 of the capital's local
districts, was part of the Met's anti-racist Operation Athena.
</P>
<P>
The suspected offenses ranged from grievous bodily harm to the
publication of racist material. The age and sex of the suspects
was not released but police said the arrests spanned Hounslow, an
Asian stronghold in the west of the city, to Greenwich, a wealthy
white enclave in southeast London.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to eradicate the fear and distress caused by hate
crime," Godsave said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain is 94 percent white but ethnic minorities have a
stronger presence in the inner cities, London chief among them.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Met's record on promoting black and Asian officers,
rooting out racist staff and clamping down on racially motivated
crime have all come under fire. An official report last year
condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
The dawn raids came as police questioned three men in
connection with the country's most notorious racist crime: the
unsolved 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Two were arrested in London, the third in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The number of racist crimes being reported in Britain was
rising sharply. Police believe greater awareness has encouraged
more victims to come forward.
