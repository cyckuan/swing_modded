   LONDON (AP) -- The mother of a black British teen-ager slain by
white youths presented Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement
award Thursday in recognition of his fight to end apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that I can speak for all South Africans, black and
white, that this award is recognition of their struggle for peace
and democracy in our country,'' the former South African president
said.

   Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award
from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a
London bus stop in 1993. She said Mandela was the only person of
world stature to take up her cause.
</P>
<P>
   After a long campaign by Lawrence, an official inquiry found
that police bungled the investigation and were racist. None of the
five white suspects was successfully prosecuted.

   Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the award
ceremony ranked among the important occasions of his life, adding,
''There's a possibility that one day I might die, and when I reach
the new world I will have many fond memories.''
