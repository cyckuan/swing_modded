<HEADLINE> UK Police Given Ethnic Recruitment Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black
and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he hoped that in 10 years' time, every force in
England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it
served.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real determination within the police service by
officers of every rank to put the past in terms of attitudes to
race behind them," the home secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south
London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police in London, which investigated the death
of the black 18-year-old, faces one of the toughest challenges.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.3 percent of its officers are black or Asian, according
to Home Office figures. It will have to increase this to more than
a quarter in line with London's population.
</P>
<P>
Only four of England and Wales' 43 regional forces are on track
to meet the targets.
</P>
<P>
Home Office research also showed that black and Asian police
officers are almost three times more likely to be sacked than
their white colleagues, and it takes a black constable about 18
months longer to be promoted to sergeant than a white constable
and 12 months longer for Asian officers.
