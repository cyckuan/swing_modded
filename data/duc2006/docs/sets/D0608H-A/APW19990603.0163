<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Advises Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new  
service at a quarter of its dealerships to advise parents on how to 
install car seats to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal  
agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using 
trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company 
will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be 
available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in  
autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in 
half, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct  
800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled 
properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in 
both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates 30,000  
child seats a year are being inspected now at community events 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton was announcing the  
initiative today at a news conference. Also involved is the child 
seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's move follows a recommendation by the National  
Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of 
``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the 
deaths of children in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70  
models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with 
different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 
100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB 
Chairman Jim Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
	This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them  
across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle 
administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. 
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government 
transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only DaimlerChrysler has come forward but other  
automakers are considering the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent  
fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,  
a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or 
daylong child safety seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's 
dealerships.
