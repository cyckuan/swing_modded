<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top federal safety official is urging  
automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first  
in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat 
where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought  
in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is sending that message to automakers in a speech he was  
delivering today at the World Traffic Safety Symposium in New York 
City, an event being held in conjunction with the New York 
International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared text, Hall warned: ``We need look no further  
than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of 
not doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags inflating in low-speed crashes have been blamed for  
killing 131 people, including 73 children. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hall sent the speech to top auto executives along  
with a letter urging them ``to discuss with your peers the need to 
reverse the trend of motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause 
of death among young Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children  
between ages 5 and 15. This decade, more than 60,000 children, 
infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about  
70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of 
federal crash data from 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal  
safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to 
learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck 
injuries. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Safety Board also has recommended automakers:  
</P>
<P>
	--Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars  
and light trucks, including the rear center seat, where they are 
often missing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they  
can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests 
rather than rise up at their necks. Most autos have adjustable 
shoulder belts only in the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.  
</P>
<P>
	In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was  
recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that 
child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto 
crashes. More than 80 percent of child seats are installed 
incorrectly, studies show.
