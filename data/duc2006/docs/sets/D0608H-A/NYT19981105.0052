   OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''? Plenty, would
seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models
to their lineup. And, there are hints that even more makers are
about to enter the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year
with the RX 300. Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki
adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley?
</P>
<P>
   Well, more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said
to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving
thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American
market, reportedly has one in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep certainly isn't sitting by. It has an all-new Grand
Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new
all-wheel-drive train. Reportedly the only things being picked up
from the '98 version are 127 screws.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider,
too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike. Which means
anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead _ not just for
price, but for features as well. Do you want full-time four-wheel
drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive? Do you want a low
range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel
drive? Do you want room to spare? Do you want to feel the ruts or
ride in carlike comfort? How high off the road do you want to be?
How easy is it to shift between drives? What's the noise level
inside like? How does it feel going around a corner? (Some SUVs,
especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an
impending rollover. If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it.)
These are questions you should answer before putting your money
down.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility
owners never go off-road. They simply use them for shopping,
commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must.
That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year
history, is putting its name on a truck. Sales of the Lincoln
Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something
to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent. Enter the Cadillac
Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding
version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali. It's not
as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its
255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose
Acoustimass sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to
desire. The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its
a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle. Some have
reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler
reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the
Mercedes family. Make your own comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99.
There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new
seats, new transmission, well, it's all new. Even the spare tire
has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle.
Chrysler hasn't missed a trick _ it spend $2.65 billion, including
$750 million in plant preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going
even if three wheels lose traction. It has a new suspension
designed for better ride and handling. And its new 16-valve,
4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less
emissions. Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual
climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about
anywhere. The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at
$34,415 for the four-wheel drive version.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury market for SUVs is growing. General Motors added the
Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it
apart from the GMC Yukon. Its one-price comes with just about
everything. The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line,
everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any
other GM SUV product. It's nicely styled and equipped. While lots
of manufacturers are citing the ``carlike'' ride of their SUVs, GM
is stressing the ``trucklike'' strength of their models, which may
have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300
($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation
along with comfort features. The RX300 raises the question of what
is a SUV? This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like
a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry
frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving.
But it has all the other SUV attributes _ high seating, all-wheel
drive, and roomy interior. It also gets better mileage than most
SUVs _ around 19 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time
4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450. The
vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser. The new vehicles are
aimed at becoming the ``King of 4WD,'' according to Toyota. The
vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent
fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the
driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button,
a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior.
</P>
<P>
   Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the
Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility. The ML320 ($34,950) has been
cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy,
usability and price _ it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line
Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee. Consumer Reports puts it at
the top of its SUV list. The only problem with the V-6 powered
ML320 is availability _ it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced
vehicle. This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with
V-8 power. Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers
set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes
bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage
during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a
system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child
is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option
that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet
wide).
</P>
<P>
   Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its
Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer. For '99 the Explorer
adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to
alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink
(a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc),
Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays
messages. On an environmental note, both the Explorer and
Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now
low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming
emissions than before.
</P>
<P>
   The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional
power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted
up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers. These features can also
be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard
for mini-sport-utility vehicles. The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be
the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body
built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a
true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system. It
includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and
descending steep hills. The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to
almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the
Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker. These will be available as
two-door convertible or four-door hardtop. The V-6 will only be
available at Suzuki dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the
East Coast and arrived in New England this fall. Along with it
comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X
in style, and more importantly, in price. The Kia Sportage starts
at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such
as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4. The Kia will be available as a
two-door convertible and four-door model.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II
and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer
Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers
have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV. SUVs sit
high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than
lower profile automobiles. The new Land Rover Discovery Series II
offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling
feeling. The Discovery features ACE _ active cornering enhancement
_ which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the
vehicle's body. This is the only vehicle sold in America that
offers such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation
of this model. The new model is slightly lower and six inches
longer than last year's. The added space goes for cargo and
rear-seat passengers. The new model also comes with another first _
an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking
on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed. The
Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8
engine that has added power and torque.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX
($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC
Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an
optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy
($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800),
Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper
($27,800), Jeep Wrangler ($14,200), Land Rover Discovery ($34,500),
Land Rover Range Rover ($56,000), Mitsubishi Montero ($33,500),
Mitsubishi Montero Sport ($18,100), Nissan Pathfinder ($23,900),
Oldsmobile Bravada ($30,700), Subaru Forester ($18,700), Subaru
Outback ($24,500), Toyota 4Runner ($20,500), Toyota RAV4 ($15,400)
and Toyota Land Cruiser ($45,900)
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, what's a Quigley? Quigley is a company that has been
converting vans and trucks to four-wheel-drive. Now it is marketing
a four-wheel-drive based on a full-size van through Ford,
Chevrolet, and GMC dealers.
