<HEADLINE> Automaker Advises on Child Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil  
change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be 
able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20  
percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car 
seats to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal  
agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using 
trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company 
will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be 
available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in  
autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in 
half, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly  
secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler 
co-chairman, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several  
pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are 
child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National 
Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct  
800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled 
properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new 
and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about  
30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000  
certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the 
current number in the United States. There will be two per 
participating dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's move follows a recommendation by the National  
Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of 
``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the 
deaths of children in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70  
models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with 
different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 
100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB 
Chairman Jim Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
	This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them  
across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle 
administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. 
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government 
transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said at the press conference that DaimlerChrysler's effort  
went beyond what he suggested for the fitting stations. ``I am 
confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will 
step forward now with their own programs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent  
fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,  
a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or 
daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's 
dealerships.
