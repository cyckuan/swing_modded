A NEW WARNING ON SIDE AIR BAGS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags
can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged
manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers
decide if they want them activated.
</P>
<P>
   Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air
bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints
significantly enhance safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether
they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said
the company has no plans to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said
Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from
side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are
installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to
provide greater safety.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side
air bags. By contrast, front air bags have been blamed for at least
145 deaths since 1990. In those cases, the impact of the bag
inflating caused serious injuries. Most of the victims were
children and short people, many of whom were not wearing seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said more than 2.4 million vehicles with
front-seat side air bags are in use, but fewer than 20,000 have
rear-seat air bags. Most manufacturers are installing front-seat
side air bags, but only Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Rolls Royce are
putting them in the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   In its consumer advisory, the traffic safety administration
warned that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children
whose head, neck, or chest are in close proximity to the air bag at
the time of deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear
seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to
deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchasers who want such air bags activated, after being
advised of the potential risk to out-of-position children, should
be able to have them switched on by their dealers,'' the advisory
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also urged manufacturers to allow owners of vehicles
with rear side air bags to bring them back to dealers to have them
deactivated if the vehicle is likely to be carrying children.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in
the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints, but manufacturers
and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point
out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat
belts and child seats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies
representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a
child safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think what the agency has done today is to needlessly scare
people,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokesman for the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged a child lying on the rear seat with his head
near the door or kneeling with his chest against the door would be
in danger if the side air bag deployed. But she said a child in
those positions would be at far greater risk if the car were hit by
another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Said Schorr of Mercedes: ``For properly restrained children,
side air bags are a great safety device that will save lives.'' He
said Mercedes plans to contact owners of its vehicles shortly to
review the benefits of side air bags used appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   A BMW spokesman said the company decided to deactivate rear-seat
air bags to give consumers a chance to review the pros and cons.
