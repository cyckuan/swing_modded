BLACK BOXES IN CARS OPEN UP SAFETY POSSIBILITIES

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You undoubtedly have heard about the ``black
box'' federal investigators retrieve from an airplane after an
accident to help understand what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and
other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight
into drivers' behavior before an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve
automobile safety. Other experts, while supporting the concept, say
it needs to be looked at more critically.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, General Motors Corp. has installed a
sensing module along with its airbags that measured and recorded
airbag performance.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1999 model year, GM began installing a more
sophisticated device that captures five seconds of data before
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Now investigators can know when the driver applied the brakes in
the seconds leading up to the crash, as well as the vehicle's
speed, engine speed and gas-pedal position, and whether seat belts
were being used.
</P>
<P>
   The use of such devices is favored by doctors, engineers and
government officials. They say real-world crashes can provide
valuable information on how crashes affect the human body.
Ultimately the data could provide insights on how to build safer
cars and improve treatment of crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of the recorders' benefits, James Hall, chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board, last month called for the
devices on cars, trains, buses and ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for all modes of transportation to realize the
unlimited potential that recorder technology has to offer, both in
terms of economics and safety,'' he said at a board conference last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list''
of safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however. The
biggest one is whether such information could be used against
drivers in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has that potential,'' said Bob Langdon, senior partner of
the Lexington, Mo., law firm of Langdon, Emison, Kuhlman &AMP; Evans.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new technology, the courts or Congress will have to
decide whether the data collected by the black boxes is admissible
as evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a trial lawyer, Langdon said he had concerns about who would
be collecting the data, how it would be used, how accurate the
devices were and how the information would be interpreted,
especially if the data contradicted other physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are issues that need to be discussed in the near
future,'' he said. ``It really needs to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   GM conceded that such information might eventually be used in
litigation, but the company said it also could be used against GM
to prove some type of defect with a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he
supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people
and vehicles react in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as another tool to be used to save lives,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a black box for automobiles is not new. Technology
that allows for its implementation is new.
</P>
<P>
   An early version of the black box was part of GM's first
regular-production driver-passenger airbag systems the company
introduced as an option in selected 1974 production vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the modules have become more sophisticated and are
capable of gathering more data.
</P>
<P>
   GM has installed its latest module in hundreds of thousands of
GM cars from the 1999 model year. Those cars include the Buick
Century, Park Avenue and Regal; the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and
Seville; the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette; and the Pontiac
Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to put the module in almost all of its vehicles in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us build an objective driver database,'' said
Terry Connolly, director of GM's North American Safety Center.
``Currently we don't know how drivers react seconds and
milliseconds before a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM
design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how
drivers react to crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an
invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very benign set of data that is being collected,''
Connolly said. ``There is more personal information available on
the Internet than what will be collected by these devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, GM has to gain permission from the vehicle's
owner before collecting the data after a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too.
Ford Motor Co. has installed data recorders in all of its 1999
models. Ford's recorders collect a limited amount of data, said
Jennifer Flake, a Ford safety spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory
Council was looking into the use of recorders to determine what
data would be the most helpful for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of these modules is important so that we can improve
our understanding of crashes and so that we have a better analysis
of how injuries are coming about,'' said Jeffrey Augenstein, a
professor of surgery and director of the William Lehman Injury
Research Center at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``With better understanding, we can better create
countermeasures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Augenstein, a trauma surgeon, said the future of the devices was
what interested him. He said the next step would be to have the
devices automatically notify emergency crews when a vehicle was
involved in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many parts of the country, crashes occur in isolated areas,
and nobody knows about it for some time,'' he said. ``With
information from a (positioning system), emergency crews could know
almost immediately where the car is and what occurred in the
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   GM offers such a system on some models under the name OnStar. It
notifies emergency crews when a car's airbag is deployed. Also, the
National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration is testing a
system in Buffalo, N.Y., that automatically notifies authorities of
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually emergency crews, Augenstein said, would be able to
look at what occurred and know what type of injuries the victims
most likely would be suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very, very exciting time in automobile safety,''
Augenstein said. ``There is a lot of opportunity to improve the
crash experience. It would be nice to say we know how to prevent
all crashes, but there will always be crashes, that is why they
call them accidents.''
