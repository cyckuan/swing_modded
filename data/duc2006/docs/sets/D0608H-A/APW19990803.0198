	DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child  
seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when 
installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags 
turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children  
in child seats near air bags. Safety experts recommend that small 
infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly 
recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of 
an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since  
1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas  
in the seat cushion. Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are 
supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and 
turn off the passenger air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed  
forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the 
passenger airbag might not turn off as designed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers would know the system was not working only because an  
``airbag off'' light would stay dark. Mercedes-Benz said there have 
been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports 
of accidents or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recommended the seats not be used and that children  
sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and  
Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would 
be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships. Mercedes dealers will 
exchange the seats for free. The recall does not affect Toddler 
seats.
