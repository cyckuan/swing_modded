<HEADLINE> New provision with seat belt law begins May 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Drivers who have spent the last 15 years
ignoring the state's seat belt law, listen up: The chance of
getting hit with a $20 fine is growing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the
authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping
drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or
their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and
disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said
Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure
Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January. ''This isn't
about punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit
children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of
adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the
number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the
state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state
falls below the national average of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted
in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat
belts, Conaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of
children killed in automobile accidents weren't wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save
up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member
that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr.
Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt
coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
''I can tell you it's very tiring, because this is preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association
opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce
and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a
20-year low in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The current fine of $20 will remain unchanged and offenders will
not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points.
