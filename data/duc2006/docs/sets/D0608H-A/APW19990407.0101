<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety in Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cars should be designed with child safety  
first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children 
ride, the head of a federal safety agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
is taking that message to automakers in New York for the annual 
auto show there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite overwhelming statistics indicating the need for better  
protection for children, child passenger safety has been an 
afterthought when it comes to designing cars. That needs to 
change,'' Hall said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at 
the World Traffic Safety Symposium, an event being held in 
conjunction with the New York International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle  
design,'' Hall said. ``We need look no further than the 
first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not 
doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags inflating in minor crashes have been blamed for killing  
131 people, including 73 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal  
safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to 
learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck 
injuries. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. 
</P>
<P>
	When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about  
70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of 
federal crash data from 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children  
older than age 5. This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants 
to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the Safety Board is urging automakers to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars  
and light trucks, including the rear center seat where they are 
often missing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they  
can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests 
rather than rise up at their necks. Most autos have adjustable 
shoulder belts only in the front seats. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.  
</P>
<P>
	In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was  
recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that 
child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto 
crashes. Government statistics indicate more than 80 percent of 
child seats are installed incorrectly.
