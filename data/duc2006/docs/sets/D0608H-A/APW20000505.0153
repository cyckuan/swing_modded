<HEADLINE> Critics: Air Bag Rules May Be Risky  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced new air bag standards
Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small
adults. Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts
could be put at greater risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags,
which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and
blamed for at least 158 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants
in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather
than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting
with 2004 model year vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and
small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags
that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as
forcefully as a 30 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and
the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed
to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults
at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough
force to protect unbelted larger adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be
killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is
where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air
bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that
temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should
install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds
depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test,
Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet
the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb
impact as well as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers
rejected that argument. If it were true, he said, the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the
National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph
test as the safer alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any
classification of vehicle,'' Roberts said. ''This rule is going to
go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's
unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of
dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and
6-year-old children. Previous tests involved only average-size men.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world
conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger
seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying
positions.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less
than $100 per vehicle.
