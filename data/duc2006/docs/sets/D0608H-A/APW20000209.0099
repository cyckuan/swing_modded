<HEADLINE> Automaker's Child Seat Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should
start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free
seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.
</P>
<P>
	   Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but
federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not
installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler Corp. began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships
in 80 cities for child seat checkups. Under the program, which will grow to
1,000 dealerships by year's end, even adults driving a competitor's vehicle can
ask DaimlerChrysler technicians if a child seat is properly installed and
children are buckled in properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats
in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. Studies show more than
80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways
to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public
hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of
those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R.
Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance.
</P>
<P>
	   If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance,
not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A.
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because
parents stop asking questions," she said. Parents need instructions in correct
installation, Tombrello said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathleen Weber of the University of Michigan Medical School suggested the
possibility of a weighted rating system that included explanations of tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that
measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash
are among pieces of information collected.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert B. Waller, Jr., who represents car seat manufacturers, said a single
rating system could be misleading. A single rating could lead manufacturers to
sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of
some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile
Products Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was
the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said. He suggested improved
instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current
mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
</P>
<P>
	   Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called
attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a
network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government,
automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a
permanent feature in every dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and
younger. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half,
government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they
are using the seats incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said
their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the
seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were.
</P>
<P>
	   Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong
sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp. financed periodic
checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the
National Safe Kids Campaign. Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats
have been inspected since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   And starting this month, GM will have a minivan in each state that will be
used to conduct car seat clinics at different sites.
</P>
<P>
	   But until DaimlerChrysler's announcement, no automaker offered parents the
chance to make an appointment at dealerships on such a wide scale.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should
call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
