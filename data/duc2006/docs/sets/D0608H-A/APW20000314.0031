<HEADLINE> Automakers Criticized on Child Seats  </HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA (AP) -- After praising DaimlerChrysler and General Motors
for their child seat safety programs, the chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board criticized six other automakers for not
doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Jim Hall, in a speech Monday at a national highway
safety meeting in Atlanta, scolded Volvo, Mitsubishi, Kia, Subaru,
Suzuki and Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the six companies have refused to set up ''fitting
stations,'' where parents can get expert advice on how to install
child safety seats. Government studies have shown that eight of 10
safety seats are installed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that all these car companies are run by responsible
adults, and if they get the message effectively -- and maybe it
needs to be repeated -- they will take the steps necessary to
address the No. 1 health problem for kids,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14
and younger. Transportation officials say properly used child seats
cut the risk of fatal injuries in half. The more common mistakes
include using the wrong size seat and using a forward-facing seat
for an infant who's not old enough to ride in one.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo spokesman Soren Johansson said he wasn't sure the NTSB had
even approached his company about a child-safety program, but he
praised the focus of the meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Child safety has been on the agenda with us for years,''
Johansson said. ''It's good to see other manufacturers are now
jumping on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Subaru spokesman Richard Marshall said his company sent a letter
to the NTSB saying it would like to cooperate in a child seat
safety program if guidelines could be worked out. Mitsubishi
spokesman Kim Custer said his company has done a series of
campaigns about child passenger safety.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the three other companies singled out by Hall
did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall praised a DaimlerChrysler program launched last month that
allows adults driving any make of vehicle to make appointments at
DaimlerChrysler dealerships to see if their child seat is properly
installed.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised General Motors, which has had a long-standing
partnership with the National Safe Kids Campaign to hold car seat
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a viable first step taken by two of our major auto
manufacturers to change the safety culture on our highways and to
put the focus on our kids,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ford Motor Co. officials told him Sunday that they plan
to announce a major car-seat program soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said BMW, Honda, Nissan and Saab are still deciding what
sort of commitment they will make. Toyota and Volkswagen have said
they will encourage dealers to set up fitting stations, but they
haven't committed any money to the effort, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also called on states to strengthen and enforce child
passenger protection laws. He said children should be in child
restraints up to age 4, in booster seats to age 8 and in the back
seat at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, not one state currently has a comprehensive child
passenger protection law with all of these requirements,'' Hall
said. ''There must be zero tolerance for unbuckled children.''
</P>
<P>
   Car crash fatalities for children ages 5-9 increased by 23
percent from 1982 to 1998. In the same time period, fatalities for
children up to 4 years old decreased by 8 percent.
