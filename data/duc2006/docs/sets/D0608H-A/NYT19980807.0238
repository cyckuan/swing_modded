NEW VOLVO S80 COMBINES LUXURY AND SAFETY

<P>
   Forget ``boxy,'' put ``utilitarian'' and ``practical'' out of
your mind and get ready to change almost all your perceptions about
the venerable Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan,
the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Due in dealer showrooms as early as mid-September, this new
front-drive, full-size sedan will a) alienate some Volvo diehards
who think boxy is just the thing, and b) draw a whole lot of new
buyers into the Volvo fold, people who just couldn't bear to buy
the type of car associated with middle-age mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The S80, with a price range of $40,000 to $43,000, will be the
most expensive production Volvo ever. But anyone who drives the
vehicle will immediately put it in the same class as European
luxury cars such as the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class and the
Audi A6.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has gone upscale with this car, and you can bet it will be
a force in the marketplace even against such heady competition.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy. Take Volvo's long-standing reputation for safety,
quality and longevity, add a full measure of luxury, and you've got
a package that the consumer in the $40,000-sedan class has been
yearning for.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, which has always been Volvo's primary focus, takes no
back seat in the new S80. This car is, without a doubt, the safest
Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized
stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new
seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end
crashes, and the ``inflatable curtain,'' Volvo's version of the
side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the
event of a T-bone collision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volvo will offer the S80 with seven different engines,
including two inline six-cylinders and five five-cylinders, only
the six-cylinders will be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line engine will be the T6, a 2.8-liter, inline
six-cylinder with double turbochargers, rated at a whopping 272
horsepower. This engine's power is on par with that of 4-liter V-8s
in competitive makes and Volvo will also sell the vehicle with a
five-speed manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   A General Motors four-speed automatic is standard for Volvos
with six-cylinder engines, and will be the one most buyers choose.
It is so smooth-shifting that it's virtually seamless.
</P>
<P>
   The second engine destined for the U.S. market will be a
normally aspirated (non-turbo) 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder rated
at 204 horsepower. This engine is expected to be the biggest
seller; from my experience, this has all the power most buyers will
ever need.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost as much as the
driver enjoys driving it. It's smooth and cushy but with enough
road feel left to give the driver some fun on curves and turns. The
rear seat is roomy enough for three adults to ride comfortably,
even on long trips, and the front bucket seats are so comfy you may
want to order a couple for your living room.
</P>
<P>
   The S80's distinct, modern design copies no other vehicle, yet
it looks as contemporary as any of its competition from Europe or
Japan. The design is the product of Volvo's California studio, led
by U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the S80 is under way at Volvo's plant in
Gothenburg, Sweden. The official on-sale date is Oct. 12, but
dealers are taking orders, Volvo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future _ the company's
first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the
traditional Volvo safety and durability _ that about 25,000 dealers
and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the
Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn
about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North
America.

   NEW FORD MINI-SUV: Ford plans to introduce an all-new compact
sport-utility vehicle for model year 2001 that will compete against
the Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than the midsize Explorer, the new model will be built
in Claycomo, Mo., where Ford makes Contour and Mercury Mystique
compact sedans. Production of those slow-selling vehicles _ if they
are still on the market by then _ will be transferred to Mexico,
the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Japanese partner Mazda will sell its own version of the
new sport-utility, the first SUV model shared with Ford since the
Mazda Navajo, a two-door version of the Explorer, was discontinued
three years ago.
