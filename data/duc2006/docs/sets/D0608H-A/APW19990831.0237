<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Child Safety Seat Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The peace of mind offered by child car seats  
can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the 
government's chief transportation safety official says few are. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
asked states Monday to get moving on setting up ``fitting 
stations'' where parents go to have child restraints installed and 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio, Hall  
offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving 
period of Labor Day holiday week. Several were driven by the 
knowledge that car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Safety advocates know that children should be in child  
restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, 
and in the back seat,'' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 
2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with  
all of these requirements in it.'' Indeed, no state requires 
booster seats for children 4 to 8, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting  
stations. So far, two are doing so, New York and South Carolina. 
Three others -- Hawaii, Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites 
where motorists can get trained in using the seats, according to 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in  
Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Denver and Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black  
youths, who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to 
use them. If seat belt use were universal among young blacks, that 
could save 1,300 lives a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He held out New Mexico's graduated licensing law as a fitting  
model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an 
expected 22 percent by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate  
license, both restricting night driving and the number of young 
passengers allowed. A full license is granted only with a clean 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall praised DaimlerChrysler, but said ``states shouldn't wait  
for automakers to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment  
of permanent fitting stations'' -- perhaps at repair shops, 
firehouses, health centers or places where cars are annually 
inspected for safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money  
to help. About $90,000 is available for fitting station 
demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal 
year, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
