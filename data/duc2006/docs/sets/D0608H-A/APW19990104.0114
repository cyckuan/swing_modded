<HEADLINE> Ford To Offer Seat-Belt Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will install a device that warns  
unbuckled drivers with an intermittent chime until they buckle 
their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belt-Minder system will be used throughout Ford's U.S.  
product line starting later this year. President Jac Nasser 
announced the system Monday at the North American International 
Auto Show's media preview.

<P>
	A sensor in the belt buckle determines if the driver has buckled  
up; if not, a red light on the dashboard goes on and an 
intermittent chime sounds until the belt is latched. On most cars 
and trucks, a chime and light go on only when the ignition is 
turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will improve safety belt usage tremendously,''  
Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers who don't want to wear their belts can disable the  
intermittent chime by buckling, then unbuckling their belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said seat belts are ``the most effective safety device  
there is,'' but that many who occasionally fail to buckle up say 
they simply forget or are too hurried. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the system eventually will be expanded to include the  
front passenger seat. The No. 2 automaker said major insurance 
companies are considering discounts for those who own or lease 
vehicles equipped with the Belt-Minder.
