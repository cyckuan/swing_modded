<HEADLINE> Safety Panel Urges Kid Seat-Fitting </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government should set up a nationwide  
network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's 
lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NTSB believes that the federal and state governments  
should be more directly involved in assuring that child safety 
seats are used correctly,'' said Jim Hall, the chairman of the 
safety agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Most parents do not know a child seat is improperly installed  
until after their child is killed or injured in a crash, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are 
used improperly. If all children using child seats were restrained 
properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated parents struggle to properly install about 70 models  
of child car seats in hundreds of different types of cars each 
year, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to 
confuse the average consumer,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Properly used child seats reduce the risk of fatal injuries by  
more than 50 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fitting stations could be established across the United  
States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration 
offices, fire stations or automobile dealerships, Hall said. He 
said the initiative should be funded out of government 
transportation dollars but had no cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The board can only recommend auto safety initiatives, but its  
recommendations carry great weight within the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall also reiterated other NTSB initiatives as part of a package  
the board believes would reduce child deaths and injuries in 
traffic accidents. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Built-in child seats should be available in more cars and  
trucks. Hall believed they should be used on airplanes and school 
buses as well. ``Isn't it unbelievable that regulations require 
everything to be secured on (airplane) takeoffs and landings -- 
everything except our smallest children,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	--All states should adopt laws that allow police to pull autos  
over when passengers are not wearing seat belts. Seat belt surveys 
have shown when a driver is buckled, restraint use for children is 
94 percent. When a driver is unbuckled, restraint use for children 
is 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children 12 and under should ride in the back seat.  
</P>
<P>
	--Children ages 4 to 8 should be properly secured in booster  
seats because they are not old enough to fit adult seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Child safety groups said permanent checkpoints would send a  
strong message about the importance of proper child seat 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do this, it will reduce the mortality of children  
(in car crashes) by at least 25 percent to 35 percent nationwide,'' 
said Martin Eichelberger, a surgeon at Children's National Medical 
Center and president of the National Safe Kids Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA is set to announce early this year a federal  
requirement that all new child safety seats must have the same, 
simple anchoring system in new cars. The average car is about 9 
years old, however, underscoring the need for child seat fitting 
stations for the millions of vehicles already on the road, Hall 
said.
