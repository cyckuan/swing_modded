<P>
   There used to be a joke that a Mercury is just a Ford with the
bolts torqued tighter.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on the perception _ correct in many cases _ that
American cars were inferior to foreign models and that little
differentiated one domestic from another.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks in part to that foreign pressure, Americans
shopping for domestic autos have plenty of quality from which to
choose, even as many of these cars remain distinctly American in
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Mercury Sable LS is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigned this year _ lowered at nose and rear, a smooth line
running up over windshield and high roof and linking the ends in a
graceful arc _ the sedan is a sleeker looking car than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable comes as a wagon, as well, and engine options include
a pair of 3.0 liters, one turning out 153 horsepower, the other,
200 horsepower. With the bigger engine I got just over 24 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the car is big, broad American. In the LS model tested,
the leather seats are wide and firm, essentially five bucket seats.
The thigh support up front is very good, though bucket seats need
better lateral support ridges than the Sable seats offer.
</P>
<P>
   The dash is deep up top and angles away nicely below, affording
plenty of legroom up front. Rear legroom is ample, as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new feature _ one that ought to catch on everywhere _ is
height adjustment (about 3 inches) on the gas and brake pedals.
Push a button on the side of the driver's seat and the pedals come
to or move away from you. For short drivers, this means they no
longer have to move the seat far forward, pushing themselves right
up to the steering wheel and bluntly in the way of an exploding
airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Further safety enhancements include front and side airbags, seat
belt pretensioners, belt use sensors, a driver's seat position
sensor, and two inflation levels for the airbags, depending on the
severity of a crash. Also sure to become standard across the
industry, the Sable has an interior emergency trunk release.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation is spartan in a simple, good way. Fuel,
tachometer, speedometer, and engine temperature are in the display
behind the wheel. Window controls, door locks, and mirror controls
are on the driver's door. In the center grouping on the dash,
arranged horizontally one above the other are audio controls up
top, climate controls below.
</P>
<P>
   Interior bins are adequate _ no large atlases, fine for standard
folding maps _ and the trunk is cavernous. A 60/40 split rear seat
allows for longer parcels and items.
</P>
<P>
   The LS Premium came with the DOHC, 24-valve, Duratec V6 engine.
Because of composite cam covers and intake manifold, it is 30
pounds lighter than the standard V6, yet cranks out 47 more
horsepower. Another sign of emerging quality: Tuneups come at
100,000-mile intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control,
and in testing it ran itself up and down the gears smoothly and
click-free.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a
lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound
rather than just attempt to repel it. The repel method can lead to
vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.
Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the
engine _ muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the
same backflow as the dual system it replaces _ was a distant
burble.
</P>
<P>
   Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so
encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors,
windows, or the sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was plenty powerful _ I'm not sure I'd be happy with
the lesser mill in this car _ and pulled the Sable up steep hills,
and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.
</P>
<P>
   My only performance complaint _ and I've noticed this in other
Ford Motor Co. products _ is a strange lag time, while the car is
already rolling, right after you press the accelerator. It's as if
the engine is getting the message and taking a split second to
decode it.
</P>
<P>
   The ride? Big American again, though stiffer laterally than in
the past. Suspension front and rear is fully independent, with
gas-pressurized struts and stabilizer bars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the Sable firm on corners (and made me wish again for
better lateral support up the sides of the leather seats), and
agile in commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   What I did not like was the front-to-rear, up-and-down bounce
that uneven roads produced. Looking out the windshield at times was
like looking over the bow of a gently bobbing boat under headway.
</P>
<P>
   Given 200 horsepower in a front-wheel-drive auto, there was
remarkably little indication of torque steer. It was evident only
in quick, sharp-turn starts from a stop, a move you don't really
need to make. On wet pavement, from a stop, rapid starts did
produce a bit of chatter up front.
</P>
<P>
   The power-assisted, ABS brakes _ vented discs up front, drums in
the rear _ brought the car to sure, swift stops, even from 50
m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   At $23,000 for this model, Mercury is getting into the territory
of some very fine, lower-level luxury cars and sports sedans. There
is no reason to exclude the Sable out of hand, but anyone looking
to spend that much money should certainly do some comparison
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The multi-folding section between the front seats. The lower
portion folds out and down, revealing storage and cup holders; the
upper folds down and becomes an armrest.
</P>
<P>
   --The use of the dead space ``V'' at the lower front of the
front windows to house parts of the speaker system. This is usually
wasted space behind the mirror mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The removable carpet pads, front and rear, are thin and cheap.
At $23,000, I'd want better.
</P>
<P>
   --The fold-down armrest between the front seats could be split
at the middle and hinged, opening for more convenient storage
space.
