<HEADLINE> Ford Unveils Rollover Protection System In SUVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Company plans to
add what it calls a rollover protection system in the fall of 2001
to its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks in an effort
to reduce fatalities, according to reports from the world's second
biggest auto maker.
</P>
<P>
The new system, unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday,
includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is
a response to the federal government's revelation that almost half
the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover
accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Its principal purpose is to help keep occupants inside the
vehicle and protected," said Helen Petrauskas, vice president of
environmental and safety engineering for Ford.
</P>
<P>
"We've looked at the most threatening current driving
conditions and developed new technologies to improve the
protection for our SUV drivers and their families," she said.
</P>
<P>
While some auto makers, including Mercedes, Volvo and BMW have
air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could
potentially help during a rollover, experts believe Ford's is the
first that is designed specifically for rollover protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 9,400 people died in rollover crashes in 1997,
according to the latest year statistics available. Forty-seven
percent of all fatalities in light trucks and SUVs result from
rollovers, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, while 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
</P>
<P>
Most often rollover deaths involve passengers being ejected
from the vehicle. Government officials and auto makers have
repeatedly said that wearing seat belts is the most important
single way to prevent passengers from being ejected in a rollover
crash.
