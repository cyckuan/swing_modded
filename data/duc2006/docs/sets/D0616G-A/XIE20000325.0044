MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have been shooting
at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at
local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections,
the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, seven guerrillas attacked an Interior Ministry
forces post in the Chechen capital Grozny, using rifles and
grenade launchers, Interfax quoted military sources as saying.
There were no casualties among the Russians.
</P>
<P>
According to an unconfirmed report, a military post in the
Argun district came under fire on Saturday, Interfax said. "The
clash went on for quite a long time," a military source was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to
break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Russian-controlled Nadterechnaya district
said Russian security and police forces carried out a special
operation on Saturday and detained 11 suspects.
</P>
<P>
The governor, Akhmed Zavgayev, told Interfax he could not
confirm a report that a bomb had been found in Znamenskoye, a
district center.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway
republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
 A travel ban was imposed from Friday through Monday to ward
off possible rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The checking regime has been tightened; the protection of
ballot stations strengthened and block stations at the entrances
to villages reinforced, Interfax quoted military headquarters in
the North Caucasus as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 460,000 registered voters are expected to cast their
ballots in 340 polling stations in 12 of Chechnya's districts.
</P>
<P>
Moscow launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in
Chechnya in August last year after separatists invaded the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly carried out
a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other Russian
cities which claimed over 300 lives.
