<HEADLINE> Chechen Blasts Tolls Rise, Rebels Issue Tough Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels committed five
terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic
Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding
74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky
announced.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax, Russian federal forces have blocked
roads leading to the city of Argun and prepared for a "mopping up"
operation after a violent apartment bloc explosion by the
terrorists killed at least 25 and wounded 81 there overnight.
</P>
<P>
Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued
Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military,
but Yastrzhembsky said it's "nothing new."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov demands that "airstrikes and artillery attacks be
stopped," and that "the troops subsequently be completely
withdrawn from Chechnya" and "the military commanders, who have
been directing operations in Chechnya, be put on international
trial."
</P>
<P>
The separatist leader also said that if the Russian authorities
present evidence showing that Chechen people have something to do
with the bombings of apartment houses in Moscow, Volgodonsk, and
Buynaksk, he is prepared to hand over the suspects to the courts "
under the control of international organizations."
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's address does not contain anything new,
Yastrzhembsky reiterated. "I can only repeat that any negotiations
with Maskhadov are possible only on the issues of surrender and
stopping resistance."
