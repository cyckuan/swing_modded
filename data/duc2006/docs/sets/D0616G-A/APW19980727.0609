	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus
region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its
restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency
reported.
	   The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures
of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of
the secessionist republic.
	   The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to
tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist
attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of
incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
	   ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region
should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single
plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is
preparing for some massive combat action.''
	   Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in
kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state
of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on
Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
	   Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior
Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service,
and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to
demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen
president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended
in political deadlock.
	   ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan
Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny
will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems
have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of
Russia and Chechnya.''
	   Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia
clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in
the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential
envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national
security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer
Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that
the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the
Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently
implement it,'' news agencies said.
	   Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed
Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
	   Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's
independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document
``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,''
he told the Interfax news agency.
	   Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car
bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were
released, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment
was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said.
