<HEADLINE>  Russia Targets Chechen Positions </HEADLINE>

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions  
with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian 
authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to 
launch terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Russians and the Chechens have been fortifying fixed  
positions in recent days, but neither side has launched any major 
offensives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been relying mostly on their big artillery  
guns. They were hammering two areas north of Chechnya's capital, 
Grozny, this morning. The echo of the exploding shells could be 
heard throughout the city. The Russians were also methodically 
shelling near the western town of Bamut, which has been under 
attack for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Defense Ministry cited five regions in central,  
eastern and western Chechnya that were hit in artillery and air 
raids in the previous 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelling was the latest development in a conflict that began  
this summer, when Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded 
neighboring Dagestan twice with the aim of setting up an Islamic 
state. They also are suspected in four Russian apartment bombings 
in September that killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya  
two weeks ago, raising fears of another all-out war there. During 
the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a 
humiliating standstill. It won effective independence for itself, 
but was left devastated and lawless. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that the  
Russian aim of establishing a security zone in Chechnya ``is close 
to completion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate objective is not only to form the security zone,  
but to destroy armed gangs,'' he said while on a visit to Ukraine, 
Russian news agencies reported. Government forces ``will not stop, 
but will carry on tasks to eliminate gangs and terrorist groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Russian troops have held off mounting a ground attack  
on the capital, Russia has shown little inclination to negotiate an 
end to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the front line is largely defined by the Terek River,  
which flows across the northern third of Chechnya, forming a 
natural defense barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians control the sparsely populated plains to the north  
of the river, though the Chechens still hold a few positions. The 
Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated 
regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads 
in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's 
eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry said that two of Chechnya's most prominent  
warlords, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, were both planning 
terrorist attacks inside Russia. Raduyev intended to target Russian 
nuclear facilities, while Basayev was training women militants to 
carry out attacks in southern Russia, the ministry claimed, without 
citing any evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 155,000 Chechens have fled since the fighting began,  
with most heading to Ingushetia, an impoverished region on 
Chechnya's western border. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian aid has been slow in arriving, and the United  
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Moscow said the next 
convoy of assistance was being delayed due to ``the very slow 
distribution of aid already delivered,'' the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emergency Situations Ministry said it was flying 52 tons of  
baby food, canned meat, sugar and other supplies into the region on 
Tuesday.
