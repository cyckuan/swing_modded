<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Pursue Operation in Chechnya to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia vowed Thursday to pursue the
mopping-up operation in the volatile republic of Chechnya to an
end and destroy all Chechen rebels refusing to lay down their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia's anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus "will
be carried out to the end, and the hotbed of international
terrorism will be wiped out. Normal, peaceful life for this part
of the Russian population... will be restored," Col. Gen. Valery
Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff, told a news
conference in Moscow Thursday, hours after President Vladimir
Putin reprimanded officials for lax security in the war-torn
region.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no parallels with the 1994-1996 Chechen war,
there will be no repeat of that tragedy," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most recent terrorist bomb attacks in a
number of Chechen communities did not produce the results expected
by their organizers.
</P>
<P>
The general said certain responsible individuals will be
brought to court for not providing proper security, making the
terrorist acts possible and leading to many deaths.
</P>
<P>
Putin had earlier made an unscheduled stop on his way back from
a summit in Central Asia to hold late night talks Wednesday at a
military base in Mozdok, just outside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The president issued televised warnings to contrite-looking
officials and ministers who took turns to stand up as he spoke to
them from behind a desk about the need to tighten security.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said there were fewer than 2,000 bandits remaining in
parts of Chechnya's southern mountains not held by Moscow. They
used nighttime attacks to give the appearance that they exist
throughout the war-ravaged republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security measures have been indefinitely tightened
up in some key Chechen cities and districts, such as in Chechnya's
temporary capital city of Gudermes, Argun and the district center
of Shali, 40 kilometers south of Grozny, he said.
