	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia's air force pumped up the pressure  
on breakaway Chechnya on Saturday, knocking local television and 
radio off the air and sending tens of thousands of civilians 
fleeing toward neighboring regions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third day of punishing airstrikes on the capital,  
Grozny. Russia's air campaign had been focused on bombing suspected 
rebel bases, but now it is targeting economic installations and 
civilian communications facilities as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Warplanes bombed the republic's television station in Grozny on  
Friday and early Saturday and damaged the equipment beyond repair, 
Russian media reported. Chechen officials said seven people were 
killed and 24 wounded in the overnight air raid on the television 
station, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military says it is trying to prevent incursions of  
Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants, who want to establish an independent Islamic  
state in southern Russia, entered Dagestan and fought Russian 
forces in August and September. They have been linked to terrorist 
bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian 
cities this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's airstrikes also knocked out a radio tower in the  
village of Goyskoye, 12 miles southwest of Grozny, Chechen 
officials said. Interfax reported that Chechnya's cellular 
communications station was also destroyed, but that report was not 
officially confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The air raids took out Grozny's oil refinery on Friday, and  
energy officials told Interfax that all refinery operations had 
come to a standstill Saturday. The refinery was burning out of 
control, said Bekhan Islamov, head of the Grozny fire department, 
and a thick pall of smoke hung over the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no means to stop the fire,'' Islamov said.  
</P>
<P>
	As Russia has shifted its air attacks from outlying villages to  
Grozny, tens of thousands of civilians have tried to leave the 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 Chechens crowded the border crossing  
between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia 
on Saturday. The line of cars and trucks waiting at the border 
stretched for miles. Russian border guards only occasionally opened 
the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingush authorities said some 20,000 Chechens had sought refuge  
there by Saturday -- most of them arriving by foot, crossing the 
border away from official checkpoints -- and that Ingushetia could 
not cope with the huge number. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the verge of a humanitarian disaster,'' said Akhmed  
Malsagov, the acting head of the Ingush government. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Air Force commander, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, told  
reporters Saturday that Russian airstrikes beginning in early 
August had killed more than 2,000 militants and destroyed some 250 
rebel strongholds and training centers in Chechnya and Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway  
republic's border with Dagestan. The air raids and the 
concentration of Russian troops have fanned fears of a full-scale 
war in Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto  
independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996. But Moscow 
still claims it is a part of Russia and has struggled to keep 
violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya. They  
detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for 
sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to 
re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two admitted that they had been trained for sabotage at a  
camp run by Khattab, an Arab warlord based in Chechnya, the reports 
said. They did not say when the men were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that  
Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to 
cross into Chechnya.
