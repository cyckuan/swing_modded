<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Regrouping  </HEADLINE>

   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The war in Chechnya has simmered down to
isolated clashes, but rebels said Monday they were regrouping for a
new offensive and top Russian commanders warned that violence will
flare up again.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, in a sign of growing concern among Russians about
the war, a group of lawmakers said they were setting up an
independent commission to investigate the situation in Chechnya,
including human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been under strong criticism from the West over the
eight-month war and United Nations High Commissioner of Human
Rights Mary Robinson this month urged formation of an independent
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Krasheninnikov, a member of parliament and commission
initiator, told a news conference that the Chechen offensive has
reached a deadlock and ''a military settlement is unlikely to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters have kept up their hit-and-run attacks on
Russian forces in recent weeks, but the fierce battles that laid
waste to the rebel republic have abated.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can no longer fight the way they did three or four months
ago, but they have carried out, are carrying out and will carry out
terrorist acts,'' said a top Russian commander in Chechnya, Col.
Gen. Gennady Troshev.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel fighter, who only identified himself as Shirvani, said
Monday the insurgents needed time to recover and regroup after the
rough and bloody winter.
</P>
<P>
   Shirvani came to Nazran in neighboring Ingushetia with 11
wounded militants for medical treatment. He said the militants were
planning ''a number of terrorist acts on the territory of
Chechnya'' at the end of the month, but for the moment were
concentrating on ''quick attacks'' on Russian checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Gudermes, two Russian policemen were killed and
three wounded Sunday when unknown gunmen opened fire on them as
they raided an apartment where rebels were suspected of hiding out,
the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military claimed that nearly a dozen rebels were
killed and several taken prisoner during another battle in the
southern Itum-Kale region, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized
about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the
northern flatlands. But the Russians have bogged down in the
southern mountains, the last major area still under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has indicated in recent weeks that it may be looking for
a way out of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission whose formation was announced Monday
will investigate the events of the current war and of the 1994-6
Chechnya war, initiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on a visit to London on Monday, said he only learned
about the commission from media reports, but that he welcomed its
creation.
