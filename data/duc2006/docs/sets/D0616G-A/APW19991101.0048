	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia opened several border crossings  
today with Chechnya, officials said, allowing terrified refugees to 
flee Russian air and rocket attacks after they had been blocked 
from leaving for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials opened border crossings at Stavropol, to the north of  
Chechnya, and at Dagestan, to the east of the breakaway republic, 
Russian news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a third border crossing in the west, three bus loads of  
refugees, including children and some injured people, crossed from 
Chechnya into the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, which 
has already taken some 170,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	But no other vehicles were let through, and a line of cars and  
trucks crammed with refugees stretched for several miles on the 
Chechen side. It was not clear why the Ingush border was not fully 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to let the refugees pass, but it is necessary to  
keep order,'' Col. Arkady Krimsky said. He said the border would be 
opened to refugees for six days and border-crossers would undergo 
several document checks. 
</P>
<P>
	All borders were closed last week, trapping up to 20,000  
refugees trying to flee Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six miles away from the Ingushetia border crossing, Russian  
artillery today heavily shelled the Chechen town of Bamut. The town 
has been a prime target for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets and artillery also targeted the Chechen capital  
Grozny and several villages to the south today. Russia used Grad 
rocket launchers and howitzers to hit some targets, said Igor 
Melnikov, a spokesman with the Russian armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets bombed a spring overnight near the village of  
Chernorechiye, killing 10 civilians, said Ruslan Magomedov, an aide 
to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. 
</P>
<P>
	Magomedov said civilians had come to the spring for drinking  
water since supplies were cut shortly after the fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since  
Russia began its offensive in September. Chechen leaders claim some 
3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian 
attacks. No independent confirmation is available, although medical 
workers have reported hundreds of civilian deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said repeatedly that Chechen claims of  
civilian casualties are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has said it sent troops into Chechnya to crush the  
militants, who are also blamed for a series of deadly apartment 
explosions in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did  
not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't 
bargain with the militants either. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of conquering the republic and bringing  
its people to their knees,'' he said, according to the Interfax 
news agency. Russia's goal is ``to destroy the terrorist stronghold 
in Chechnya and make (the republic's) revival possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never sit at a negotiating table with gangsters who  
have blood on their hands,'' Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said Islamic militants, who twice invaded neighboring  
Dagestan from Chechnya this summer, were planning new attacks on 
chemical and nuclear power plants in Russia, as well as on Russia's 
transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that  
if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be 
forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Makhashev said he wasn't making a threat ``but a belated  
warning,'' according to Interfax.
