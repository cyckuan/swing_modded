<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Offers to Halt Military Offensive in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today
announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel
Chechnya from midnight (2000 GMT) today and start a partial
withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist
fighters would be hit hard if they stage "terrorist" attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal
forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from "peaceful areas" to the
Chechen border areas.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, approved by the Russian Security Council on
March 15, is intended to end the 15-month fighting in the
mountainous region of Chechnya and boost Yeltsin's chances of
re-election in June.
</P>
<P>
He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in
Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we will not tolerate terrorist actions. Responses
to them will be adequate. The security of Russian citizens must
be strictly maintained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be
held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
He said the main problem remaining is the status of the rebel
republic and stressed that Chechnya must stay within the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin offered to resume talks with the separatist fighters
through intermediaries. Negotiations broke down amid mutual
recriminations last December after a shaky ceasefire collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"The main condition under which negotiations on the status in
Chechnya could be started is normalizing the situation in the
republic and establishing peace, calm and stability there,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said Russia may grant amnesty to
combatants of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, but said
it would exclude those who have committed grave war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in
a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev.
