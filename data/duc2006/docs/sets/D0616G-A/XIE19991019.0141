<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Bombing Raids on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops Tuesday
continued air and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, destroying some rebel bases and a
communications relay station, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal forces continued to prepare weapons and
equipment for combat use and were taking measures to improve
coordination between units, the Interfax news agency quoted the
ministry's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to
let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch "large-scale
retribution actions" while staging subversive and terrorist acts
in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and
Krasnodar.
</P>
<P>
It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have
formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, avoiding direct clashes with federal troops, have
resorted to "guerrilla tactics."
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one-
third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the
retaken areas, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax reported that on Tuesday Moscow's envoy to Chechnya,
Nikolai Koshman, and representatives of the Chechen community and
of the 1996 Chechen parliament arrived in Mozdok to set up local
governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the massive assault on the rebels following
two waves of armed incursions into Daghestan led by Chechen
warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only
by his last name.
</P>
<P>
The two have been accused of masterminding a series of
terrorist explosions that killed about 300 people in Moscow and
two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, capital city of the rebel province, a commander
said Chechnya is ready to name the organizers of those terrorist
acts and produce material and documented evidence to international
organizations and the press, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
While urging Chechen authorities to hand over Basayev, Khattab
and other suspected terrorists, Moscow has all along rejected any
mediation from outside, saying the Chechen issue is its internal
affair.
