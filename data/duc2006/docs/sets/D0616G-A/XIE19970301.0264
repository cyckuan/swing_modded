MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security
on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist
attacks.

<P>
Kulikov told Interfax news agency that the interior ministry
had put important targets under heavy guard in light of statements
from the rebel commanders that they would continue the war against
Moscow.

He said the eastern border would be closed to bandits but the
ministry would not send more troops to reinforce the region.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev,
Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. They said they
would launch terrorist activities, involving 5,000 people, against
Russia until Moscow recognized the independence of Chechnya.

<P>
The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department
to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Friday.

Newly elected President of Chechnya, Aslan Maskhadov, ordered
that kidnappers be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

<P>
Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages
in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen
criminals.
