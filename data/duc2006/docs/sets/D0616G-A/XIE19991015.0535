<HEADLINE> Bombing Continues on Rebel Positions in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the
first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
</P>
<P>
Rebel command headquarters, bases and storage facilities near
the villages of Zebir-yurt, Pervomaiskoye, Raduzhnoye and Dolinsky
were targeted in the latest raids, the Interfax news agency
reported, citing the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a radio station of the Severny airport and a
bridge near the village of Chishki were also destroyed, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops "blocked off 23 villages in the Chechen
districts of Shelkovsky, Naursky and Nadterechny," the service
said.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen
intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four
apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities. Authorities believe Chechen rebels
masterminded the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of federal troops in Chechnya,
said Friday that the first stage of the counter-terrorist
operation has been successfully completed and that federal troops
have assumed control over one third of the Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
"We created such circumstances that (militants) should expect
us anywhere, any time. This is what's happening now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative,
Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees
are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations put the total
number of Chechen refugees at over 156,000, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially difficult in the tiny republic of
Ingushetia where over 147,000 refugees are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Migration Service says the number of refugees may
eventually rise to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are rushing tents, clothes, food, medicines and
other humanitarian aid supplies to the refugees.
