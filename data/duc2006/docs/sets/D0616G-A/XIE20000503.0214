MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued air
raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions
were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks
during the May holidays.

Su-24 assault planes and Su-24 bombers flew 10 sorties over the
past 24 hours, targeting mountain trails in southern Chechnya to
block rebel routes and rebel positions in mountain forests in the
south and southeast regions.

Meanwhile, Mi-24 helicopter gunships took off 30 times to
provide air support for ground troops.

Amid mounting incidence of rebel attacks, the federal command
has restricted the movement of citizens across the republic during
the May holidays to prevent subversive and terrorist acts,
Interfax reported.

The movement of motor columns has been banned from May 1 to 11,
the headquarters of the combined federal grouping said.

The situation in Chechnya remains complicated and federal
checkpoints have come under attacks for five to eight times over
the past 24 hours.

"The rebels operate in mobile groups consisting of five to 15
members, and carry out sorties to populated areas and to the
flatland," Interfax quoted the headquarters as saying.

In another development, three policemen were killed Tuesday
when their car came under fire on the Argun-Kizlyar motorway. The
