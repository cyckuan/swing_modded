<HEADLINE> Casualties of Russian Soldiers in Chechen Blasts Over 100, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest report shows that the
casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of
terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached
over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, 38 soldiers were killed, 76 wounded and 25 missing
in the blasts, the Itar-Tass quoted the ministry's interior agency
in the troubled republic as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 31 people died in a military hostel explosion in the
city of Argun overnight. Rescuers have recovered 26 bodies of the
Russian special policemen (OMON units) from the rubble of the
police dormitory Monday afternoon, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The blast in Argun also killed three civilians who were staying
near the building. Now ruins-clearing work is still underway and
more corpses will be found, it said.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebels have staged a fresh wave of terrorists acts
since Russian troops launched a large-scale mopping-up campaign
against the militants in late June, especially after federal units
annihilated a 200-250 strong gang of Arab mercenaries near central
Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt last week.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
journalists Monday that separatists had become more active in the
turbulent republic and the number of terrorist acts had
considerably risen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 100-more militants had been recently killed in a
five-day battle near Serzhen-Yurt, where the rebels had been
rallying to deal strikes at Argun and the second largest Chechen
city of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists aim to make strikes at important populated
localities in Chechnya in a bid to show their combat potential,
and they also planned to kill some prominent representatives of
the federal authorities and military command, said the Kremlin
senior official.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the terrorist acts are also designed to
intimidate the Chechen population and to challenge the newly
appointed head of interim federal administration in Chechnya,
Akhmad Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
Moscow says it has eliminated most rebels in Chechnya after a
nine-month bloody war and now it is fighting remnant terrorists,
responsible for a series of bomb blasts in the capital and other
Russian cities among other acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have vowed to fight a guerrilla-style war against
the Russians and have launched an increasing number of hit-and-run
attacks -- a tactic which helped drive Russian troops from the
province in the 1994-1996 Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Russian forces have suffered increasing losses
from rebel ambushes and booby traps planted on highways.
</P>
<P>
Russian official figures put total federal losses at more than
2,300 since troops repelled an incursion by Chechen rebels into
the neighboring republic of Dagestan last August, ahead of the
full-scale military campaign.
</P>
<P>
In early June, Kremlin said that despite decades of thousands
of rebels were wiped out, there were still 2,000-2,500 remnants
staying in Chechnya and engaged in guerrilla warfare, ambushes and
terrorist acts.
