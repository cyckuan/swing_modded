<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Vows to Liberate Whole Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia is determined to liberate
the entire breakaway republic of Chechnya and to restore normal
life of the Chechen civilians, said Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The liberation of Chechnya is the goal set for the federal
armed forces. President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted
backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya," Sergeyev
said in Fergana, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Sergeyev arrived in
Uzbekistan Wednesday to analyze the performance of the Southern
Commonwealth Shield-99 exercise, aimed at fighting large terrorist
units with Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek forces
involved.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the Russian Eastern Army has surrounded
Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, and there are very few
militants remaining.
</P>
<P>
He believes that local volunteers will make the greatest
contribution to the liberation of Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
Naurskaya, Shelkovskaya and Nadterechnaya districts are
completely controlled by the federal troops, who have also taken
control of seven of the 22 villages in the Gudermes district and
nine of the 31 villages in the Grozny district, while the
separatists are short of weaponry, munitions and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the federal troops will soon surround the
populated areas where the rebels congregate.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha
districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the
federal troops, said a source from the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The source said foreign extremists and weaponry are arriving
from abroad to aid the Chechen militants, with more than 300
terrorists coming from the Middle East in October, and by orders
of field commander Shamil Basayev and Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov. They have moved to the villages in the Itum-Kale,
Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts.
