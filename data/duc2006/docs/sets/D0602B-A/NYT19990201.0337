 &HT;    IOC holds doping summit

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee
gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the
spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet
another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors,
follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East
German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering
male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested
positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French
authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de
France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of
mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in
exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities. And there is some doubt
whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or
a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe
drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State
professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and
Exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is interwined. The drug scandals are not separate
from the bribes. This is the modus operandi of this organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business. So you
cover it up. You put in place a system that would hoodwink the
public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but
you can say you have a system. The problem is, people have become
wise to the PR scam.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of
producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and
cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home
the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later
had to retract. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from
the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful
to athletes. He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode,
head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed
had harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50
million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the
ground. This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an
international doping agency and to commit $25 million to
anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports
federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get
rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert
attention,'' Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's
flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the
independence of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and
swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life
bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of
``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some
first-time offenders. The suspicion has lingered for years that the
IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a
scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the
athletes tested positive at an Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta
Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected
by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned
strength-builders. An arbitration panel threw out the
disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for
using a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a
high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta
Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at
$500,000 each. De Merode said the tests were declared invalid
because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical
difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the
IOC medical commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne
Ljungqvist said. ``Of course, it concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw
drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up
``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games. Those athletes' initial
``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on
their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were never identified.
</P>
<P>
   De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests
mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close
of the Games. History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10
positive tests, not 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing
months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976
Olympics),'' Catlin said. ``That never came to pass. Then, it came
out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the
athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost. I don't know
where they went. All I know is there were some cases that did not
go to 'B' confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate
judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the
(U.S.) women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime
in their preparation for the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug
case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben
Johnson flunking a test for steroids. In retrospect, he often is
cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug
use to get caught.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports
officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their
athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the
Russian ship near the close of the Games. He later confirmed the
story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it
necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last
minute,'' Catlin said. ``But that is not unlike the situation being
revealed during the East German trials. They did the exact same
thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before
leaving for the Games. But there is a difference between the
practice and what is done with the results. If you don't do
anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy. The U.S.
Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather
than contracting with an independent agency. Its own advisory panel
concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the
USOC supports the same athletes financially.
</P>
<P>
   Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for
random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official
acknowledged.
