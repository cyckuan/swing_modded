<HEADLINE> Two Moroccans Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been  
stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building 
steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and  
Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 
400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda 
Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze  
medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building  
steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests 
-- including several at the Pan American Games and even others 
announced this week in advance of the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive  
among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited 
laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field  
events. No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said most gold medal winners were tested. Suspicions about  
Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically 
in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The track and field events were held Aug. 11-14 while the games  
formally opened on Aug. 15 for other events. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey  
withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for 
Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford  
Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers 
tarnished by positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal. The Arab  
Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban 
athletes. Bans imposed by international organizations range between 
two months and life. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan,  
rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the  
country of working with steroids. We have 100 percent confidence in 
the tests and everything has been conducted according to the 
international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time  
in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon. Twelve 
athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.
