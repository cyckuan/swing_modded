   HOUSTON _ During a U.S. Gymnastics meet last March in Baytown,
Texas, a teen-age contestant approached one of the visiting members
of the Olympic team and asked what he could do to gain strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift weights,'' he was told. ``And eat your Wheaties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheaties?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Wheaties,'' the older gymnast said, with a grin and a
wink.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager asked no more questions. He understood the coded
message: steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic
competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the
1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the
health hazards they pose.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Olympic shot-put champion Randy Barnes tested
positive _ for the second time in his career _ for
performance-enhancing banned substances. Also failing his steroid
test, at about the same time, was Olympic sprinter Dennis Mitchell,
a bronze medalist in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic (which means ``building'') steroids were made illegal
in the United States in 1990, except with medical prescription.
They are designed to imitate testosterone or to stimulate its
production. Testosterone, a male sex hormone (also found in small
amounts in women), induces growth of skeletal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   But at the dosage levels needed to build muscle, the steroids
put so much strain on the liver, kidneys and heart that the athlete
risks death before the age of 50. Pro football star Lyle Alzado and
many weightlifting competitors of the 1970s died young, ravaged by
tumors and cardiac disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in
Houston believes steroid use has declined in the past decade. But
he said, ``Once you get into the elite levels of athletics, the
least bit of performance enhancement becomes important, and those
people will try all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the sport of bicycle racing has been scandalized by
EPO, which stands for erythropoietin (eri-throw-poy-i-tin). This is
a steroid that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood
cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance
athletes, such as five Tour de France bicyclists who recently
disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Gremion, after resigning his position of consultant
for Swiss bicycle teams, said ``almost all'' the Tour de France
cyclists use performance-enhancing drugs. He told reporters in
Europe: ``Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and
syringes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOILING TESTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like other steroids, EPO has legitimate medical purposes, when
used in moderate amounts. A protein-carbohydrate compound, EPO is
helpful in treating kidney disease, AIDS and cancer. But it is
dangerous when taken in dosages large enough to affect performance
in a marathon run or a bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' said Dr. Kenneth Renney of Sports Medicine
Associates in Houston, ``is that you don't know exactly how much to
use and what the effects are. If you get too many blood cells, you
can get sluggish, and the blood thickens.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves athletes at risk of blood-clotting, stroke and heart
attacks. In the past 20 years, EPO has been implicated in more than
two dozen deaths in cycling.
</P>
<P>
   EPO usually goes undetected because tests cannot distinguish
between the hormone produced by the kidneys from the laboratory
version.
</P>
<P>
   But when blood tests reveal an excessive percentage of red blood
cells, the athlete is presumed to be using EPO illegally and is
suspended for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   EPO is one of at least 20 anabolic steroids prohibited by the
International Olympics Committee. New ones are constantly being
invented. No sooner is one blacklisted than another emerges to
confound drug testers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking
agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Renney, a crew chief of the U.S. Olympic drug-testing committee,
said, ``There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being
detected. That's why some athletes fail the test. But they can use
diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly,
and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear
the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said tests will be developed that will make it more
difficult for athletes to cheat with steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Japanese company is developing biological markers that will
detect the steroids people are taking,'' he said. ``The technology
may be at that level to test the athletes at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. We'll be able to shut down the use of anabolic steroids
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, many athletes engage in a delicate balancing act,
trying to take as many hormone supplements as they can _ legal and
illegal _ without exceeding the limits of red blood count or the
6-to-1 ratio between testosterone and its metabolic breakdown
product of epitestosterone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE ADDICTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Greg Hoover, a sports medicine specialist in Houston, said
new products allow athletes to fine-tune the testosterone level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some athletes are using testosterone patches that release the
testosterone into the body at a gradual, lower dose,'' he said,
``like a Nicorette patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Renney explained that the testosterone limit was set to take
into account that ``everyone is going to have some type of level of
anabolic steroids, since they are found naturally in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Although men generally have a testosterone/epi ratio of 3 to 1
or 4 to 1, some are naturally as high as 6 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people could take anabolic steroids and still be within
that approved level,'' Renney said. ``You can look at the tests,
and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing
you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, ironically a vocal opponent of steroids, tested over
the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who formerly competed for Texas A&AMP;M University in
College Station, Texas, was cited for using androstenedione, which
is found in wild yams and is legal in the United States and most
other countries but has been banned from Olympic competition
because of its steroidlike qualities.
</P>
<P>
   While Olympic athletes, such as Barnes and Mitchell,
occasionally slip up and get caught, Renney said, ``If they want to
do it, they're going to find a way to beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be naive to think anabolic steroids have been
eradicated from the National Football League, which has a limited
drug-testing program, or from Major League Baseball, which has no
drug-testing program at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since possession of anabolic steroids is illegal, no
big-leaguers admit, on the record, to using them. But some say,
anonymously, that about 30 percent of the hitters include them in
their muscle-building program.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said, ``There was
one kid, 27, who was cycling steroids, and I asked him, `Do you
realize you could need an artificial heart when you're 40 years
old?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I don't care what happens at 40. All I want to do is
be the biggest, baddest guy I can be right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking of Mike Spinelli, a 1995 fourth-round
draft choice of the Boston Red Sox, who began ingesting steroids at
18.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Spinelli's 6-2 frame filled out from 180 to 245
pounds. But he did not pitch well: 4-10 with a 5.57 ERA in two
minor-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that he was addicted to steroids, Spinelli checked himself
into the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota last February. ``I just
thank God I was able to get out of this,'' he said, ``before it
killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE TEMPTATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Athletes _ and even nonathletes _ much younger than Spinelli
have been turning to steroids. A report by the National
Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse estimates that half a
million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 965 pupils in Massachusetts middle schools
found that 2.7 percent admitted to using anabolic steroids, with
the percentages almost the same for girls as for boys. Some were as
young as 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, parents are buying these substances on the black
market and passing them on to their athlete children.
</P>
<P>
   But studies also have shown that about 40 percent of the high
school students using steroids are doing so not to compete in
sports but to improve their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Yesalis, a Ph.D. at Penn State University, recently
reported that about 1 percent of girls in grades eight through 12
have used anabolic hormones _ a 100 percent increase by this group
since 1996. Among teen-age males, steroid use had remained stable
at about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures dismay Garner, who has seen the alarming effects of
steroids on men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd see guys suddenly add a lot of muscle,'' Garner said.
``They'd say, `I'm just lifting weights.' But then you'd see them
tear up phone booths at night and lift cars at odd hours, and you'd
say, `You're doing something else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garner understands the temptation. ``You realize you can't
compete against somebody doing steroids,'' he said. ``They're
faster, quicker, stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he looked to steroids as a means of delaying the end of
his playing career. He thought they might help him regain the 10
pounds of muscle mass he had lost after back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew one player who had done steroids at that time, and
I talked with him about using them to put muscle back on,'' Garner
said. ``But I had some friends who were doctors, and they told me,
`You might have heart disease in 10 years.'''
</P>
<P>
   He decided he didn't want to sacrifice years of life for a few
extra glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids today?'' he said. ``I don't know if they're
thinking about the future.''
