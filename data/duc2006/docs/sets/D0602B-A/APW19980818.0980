	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East
German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors
confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing
drugs to female swimmers.
	   All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged
the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when
they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
	   Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew
only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had
thought they were were reversible.
	   ``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his
co-defendants.
	   Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with
causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East
Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
	   One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by
the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such
side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair
growth.
	   Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without
telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part
of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic
champions.
	   Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad
shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes
over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. But since
German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to
enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German
government files.
	   On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations
about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors,
which was part of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid
injections, as prosecutors have charged.
	   Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to
the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers.
	   Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus
Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic
endurance. However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance
firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
	   Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff
in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for
ill effects from the steroids.
	   Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and
nothing worrying was found.
	   Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the
steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with
acute liver problems.
	   He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about
the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their
parents.
	   Because all five made statements before the court, no other
witnesses were likely to be called. A verdict could come as early
as Thursday.
	   Although they could get up to three years in prison, the
defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
	   The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and
doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin
swim team.
	   Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He
admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids
to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
	   His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches
and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be
handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no
verdict was expected.
