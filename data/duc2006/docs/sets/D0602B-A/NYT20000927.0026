JONES TAKES 200 HEAT; DRUG USE CONTINUES TO TAINT GAMES

   SYDNEY, Australia _ As yet another drug scandal struck the
Olympic track and field competition on Wednesday, Marion Jones
sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her
husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her
opening heat in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the
women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was
ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the
steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   Mihaela Melinte of Romania, a two-time world champion in the
hammer throw, became the seventh person suspended at the Sydney
Games for failed drug tests. She tested positive June 7 at a meet
in Milan, track and field's world governing body said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third drug scandal involving Romanians in Sydney.
Tuesday, the 16-year-old gymnastics all-around champion, Adreea
Raducan, was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for
the stimulant ephedrine. Earlier, the entire Romanian
weight-lifting team was expelled after two athletes had tested
positive for nandrolone before the Games. The lifters who had not
tested positive were allowed back in after Romanian Olympic
officials paid a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or
been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses,
confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing
drugs is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   This morning Melinte was preparing to warm up for the hammer
throw qualifying round when ``she was informed of the reason why
she could not compete,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for
track and field's world governing body, known as the IAAF ``She
said she didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is the steroid for which the shot-putter C. &UR;  &LR; J.
Hunter, Jones's husband, tested positive for four times this
summer, the IAAF said. Hunter has said that he believed he ingested
the substance from taking improperly labeled and contaminated
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not refer to her husband's troubles after she won her
heat of the women's 200 meters in 22.75 seconds. She spoke only of
her race, saying she was simply trying to conserve energy in the
first heat because she had another round of the 200 scheduled for
Wednesday night, as well as qualifying for the long jump. Her
awkward form in that event figures to be her biggest impediment to
becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold
medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stated all along that this day was going to be the most
difficult for me because I had two heats of the 200 and the long
jump,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the 200 was Inger Miller, the 1999 world
champion and the only real threat to Jones in the event. Miller
earlier withdrew from the 100 meters, which Jones won last
Saturday, after suffering a strained hamstring in training before
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is still hoping she can run on the American 4x100-meter
relay, which is scheduled for Saturday, her agent, Emanuel Hudson,
said this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the U.S. track and
field federation, said specifically that Miller did not fail a drug
test and was eligible to compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the preliminary
heats of the women's 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 8.08 seconds and is
an inviting position now to win the gold medal. The American
champion, Regina Jacobs, withdrew before the Games with a
respiratory viral infection. And on Wednesday, the defending
Olympic champion at 800 and 1,500 meters, Svetlana Masterkova of
Russia, did not complete her heat of the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Masterkova has had surgery on both Achilles' tendons in the past
year, and her return to form has been uncertain. She had dropped
any intention of defending her 800-meter title and she had avoided
the European racing circuit as she tried to regain her fitness. She
pulled up during on Wednesday's heat and burst into tears as she
hobbled off the track.
</P>
<P>
   The other American entrant in the women's 1,500, Marla Runyan,
struggled through the first round but qualified for the semifinals
in 4:10.83. Runyan is the first legally blind athlete to make the
American team in any sport.  &QL;
