 &HT;    The allure of sports drugs hard for women to resist

   ATLANTA _ It's no longer a secret. Many male athletes are
supplementing their fitness techniques of chugging milk and lifting
weights with performance-enhancing drugs. The temptation also is
becoming too great for some female athletes to resist. Substances
such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than
on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger
boost.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.4
percent of female high-school students acknowledged using the
illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males.
</P>
<P>
   _ A survey of youngsters at four Massachusetts middle schools,
published this spring in the journal Pediatrics, found that 2.6
percent of girls were users, barely behind the 2.8 percent rate for
boys.
</P>
<P>
   _ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor
Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college
athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10
percent in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is increased competition and more at stake,''
Yesalis said, ``potential pro outlets and potential scholarships
because of Title IX, you're going to see more people willing to
cheat to gain an advantage over their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing an increased number of parents, similar with
teenage boys, that get carried away. They don't provide their kids
with a moral and ethical foundation, where they know there are
certain boundaries you shall not cross in pursuit of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the dangers of steroids for women, with
documentation provided by recent trials involving trainers and
coaches from the former East German sports empire.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Krieger, 1986 European shot put champion, was given
mysterious blue pills that she thought were vitamins. She developed
facial hair and a dramatically enlarged Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   Krieger recently announced plans to sue the coaches and trainers
for allegedly force-feeding her steroids without her knowledge.
Krieger had a sex-change operation and changed her first name to
Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted them, but they took advantage of me,'' Krieger
testified at a trial of East German officials, some of whom
admitted to supplying drugs to athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Some sports leaders in the former Soviet Union and, more
recently, China also have incorporated steroids into building
strong women's programs. The carrot dangling in front of them is
the relative newness of women's sports, which allows countries to
make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics. ``We think it is
easier for the women to shoot into international fame,'' said
professor Tian Maijiu, vice president of the Beijing Institute of
Physical Education.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials adamantly deny existence of a state-run doping
program, claiming instead that individual coaches push too hard.
The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have
tested positive for steroids since 1990. When the Chinese women's
swim team arrived in Australia for the world championships in
January, customs officials uncovered 13 vials labeled ``growth
hormone'' in an athlete's luggage. Four of those swimmers were
banned this summer for two years.
</P>
<P>
   A case study on the striking influence of steroids on women is
the East German runner Marita Koch, whose 47.60 seconds for the 400
meters in 1985 is a world mark that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Koch had been doping with Oral-Turinabol, a
testosterone-based steroid, for at least four years leading up to
her record run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have relatively little (testosterone) and now, with
testosterone-based anabolic steroids, you can double, triple, even
increase by 10 times the amount (in their bodies),'' said Jaci Van
Heest, director of exercise physiology for U.S. Swimming. ``The
bang for the buck is much greater than doing it to a guy because
they already have the natural amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you have the huge growth in women's sports, and there
are a lot of issues that make it fertile ground for any kind of
cheating.''
