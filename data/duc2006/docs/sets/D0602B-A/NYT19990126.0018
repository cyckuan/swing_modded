<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mark McGwire's record-setting home run race made 1998
a banner year for baseball and sports in general.
</P>
<P>
   But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious
and potentially devastating: athletes using performance-enhancing
substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's admission that he used two supplements, creatine and
androstenedione or ``andro,'' suddenly put new light on a
decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other
so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition.
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire's admission has come a new set of concerns:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements
as a way of improving performance, fitness and recovery from
injuries, instead of building body strength naturally.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That the supplements will be lumped together and
considered to be medically sound simply because they are available
over the counter or via mail order.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That policies such as the University of Washington's to
administer creatine to athletes might some day create great
liability if medical complications are found in the future.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)That while creatine is considered medically safe, andro is
considered to be an anabolic steroid that can lead to several
potentially life-threatening diseases. Linking the two and using
both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire will go down in the history books as the
unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes
who used similar substances last year faced far different
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings
points and $94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the
International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an
anabolic steroid. His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open
title ended over the weekend, but his appearance stirred
controversy among his fellow players, who question how Korda could
have been allowed to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the medical community and ethical
questions about unfair competition, athletes like McGwire and Korda
are big-name indicators that supplements have become ingrained at
all levels in the world of athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can easily blame ourselves and society for putting
professional and high-level collegiate athletes on such a pedestal
that it's going to influence our high school athletes,'' said Dr.
Mark S. Juhn of the University of Washington's Primary Care Center
Sports Medicine Clinic. ``I think that's a shame, but it's
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids
and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Supplement use appears to be starting at younger ages. A study
published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3
percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were
using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ubiquitous, there's no doubt about that,'' said Charles
Yesalis, a Penn State professor of health and human development who
has written a book on the subject, ``The Steroids Game.'' McGwire's
admitted use makes him ``a very poor role model for kids, and he
can argue that it's legal to buy in society, but that's merely a
loophole in the laws. He can say anything he wants, but it's a
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Olsen, president of the Washington Vocational Sports
Medicine Association and the head athletic trainer at South Kitsap
High School, has seen the problem first-hand and believes McGwire's
admission has only clouded the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to be good at whatever they do has some sort
of a hero. And if their hero is using (a performance supplement),
then they will be more susceptible to it,'' Olsen said. ``They
think, `This can't hurt me because I don't have to have a
prescription for it.' They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic
too, but you wouldn't want to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young
athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid powder found naturally in skeletal
muscle, heart, brain, testes and other tissues. It is classified as
a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain,
and not a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is acceptable, and it does enhance performance,''
Yesalis said. ``Although, if you could get the proper dose of
creatine in the food supply, why would anybody pay for it? It will
cost you $40 to $50 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Andro, on the other hand, is considered an anabolic steroid
because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone
testosterone, and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed
recovery from sports-related injuries. Because it is still
available at many vitamin stores, mail-order businesses and
Internet suppliers, andro is not considered an illegal substance by
major league baseball or the NBA, which ban only illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the controversy surrounding McGwire's use of andro,
baseball commissioner Bud Selig and players union head Donald Fehr
have appointed a committee to study whether it should be banned,
but the committee has yet to reach a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Andro, however, already has been banned by the International
Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the ATP tennis tour, and the NFL
has banned its use since 1996, primarily because it can be
classified with other steroids. While the method of taking the
steroid is far different from the injections athletes once used,
many experts believe the basic health repercussions are the same:
excessive acne, shrinkage of the testicles or uterus, and
potentially life-threatening ailments such as liver damage,
premature heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire can set the home run record using andro, other
athletes haven't been so lucky. Gold medal shot-putter Randy
Barnes, the world-record holder, drew a lifetime ban last year for
testing positive for andro. And in September, Pittsburgh Steelers
offensive tackle Paul Wiggins was suspended for four games after
admitting he used the substance.
</P>
<P>
   Use of creatine, however, hasn't yet been banned by any sports
organization, although there is plenty of debate about its effects
and potential long-term health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our athletes have been using creatine for three years
or so,'' South Kitsap's Olsen said. ``It's not something we supply,
it's not something we tell our kids they have to be on. They go out
to their own people and do their own thing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body
building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and
because so many athletes endorse its use.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington, strength and conditioning coach
Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under
his direct supervision, with little or no apparent ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enhances the short-term burst energy system,'' Huegli said,
adding that most of the benefit comes during weightlifting
training, rather than in on-field performance.
</P>
<P>
   Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition
and training without the use of supplements before trying anything
like creatine. But he says athletes will always be tempted to use
supplements because it ``helps them recover better and train longer
and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month
supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it, but the
school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability
should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future. Athletes
now must buy their own supply.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find young athletes who have used creatine. One
high school football player, Brian, of Mountlake Terrace, said he
began using the supplement last year in an attempt to build more
muscle mass and help him during offseason weight training. He
learned about creatine from other players who were using it on a
regular basis. But after experiencing some weight gain, he soon
decided that the expense wasn't worth the results he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that it was better to do it naturally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another high school football player, a 17-year-old from Edmonds,
still uses creatine and says he grew from 167 pounds to 190 pounds
in about six months after using the supplement and increasing his
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work unless you also work harder, but it helps you
work harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical jury still is out on creatine, but it appears to be
far safer than an anabolic steroid or a product such as andro.
However, there are few studies on its effects on adolescents, and
none on long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to separate fact from hype when it comes
to creatine,'' said Juhn of UW's sports medicine clinic. ``Creatine
has some potential, but people have this underlying assumption that
it works for everything, but it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, it doesn't help sprinters or distance people in
track or swimming, said Juhn, who recently published a study on
potential side effects of creatine in the Clinical Journal of Sport
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Juhn says the weight gain associated with creatine is largely
due to water storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is, in the long-term, does creatine improve
strength? That's up for debate right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn, trainers like
Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no
information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   From the information he has seen, Olsen believes there are
several reasons to beware of the supplement: dehydration, possible
kidney problems and cost. He reports some young athletes spend
hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to andro or other steroids, creatine ``is probably the
least harmful, but in 10 years you might have some kid who took
three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the
kidneys or something like that,'' Olsen said. ``If you get a
symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you
relate that back to their creatine use?''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some benefits, Olsen said, noting some athletes
have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once they get off of it, they lose maybe half that
weight,'' he said. ``It takes so much water to digest that
protein.''
</P>
<P>
   Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles, but in
the brain, the heart, the liver and testicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really studied what taking oral levels of creatine
does to creatine levels elsewhere,'' he said. ``I'm saying we don't
know. ... For all we know, creatine might be the safest thing in
the world, but we haven't proven that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen says he doesn't know of any of his athletes who are
currently taking andro, but he's convinced that many kids are
trying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet if you talk to kids, most would say they're not scared
by it,'' he said. ``It's the idea, would you trade a gold medal if
you could only live five years? Yeah, give me the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis believes there will always be some new product on the
market that will attract athletes. One is human growth hormone,
which is used as an ergogenic supplement by body builders and has
such a short half-life it is nearly impossible to detect by
standard drug-testing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Yesalis contends that many athletes who use creatine or andro do
so to mask their hidden use of human growth hormone to build even
bigger bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a
smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many athletes using such products, there might be no way
to turn back the tide short of drug testing at every level of
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disturbed by the emphasis put on supplements when we
should be thinking about the most proven method of enhancing
athletic performance, which is dedication, perseverance, hard work
and practice,'' Juhn said. ``It's really discouraging, what's
happening now.''
