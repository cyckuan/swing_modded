<HEADLINE> Dominican Calls for Sympathy for Disgraced High Jumper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The human aspect should
be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose
Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization
Committee said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo
of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American
Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the
doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the
women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the
Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped
of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive
for steroid.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes are not machines. They are human beings, and every
human makes mistake, " Puello said.
</P>
<P>
"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to
acknowledge that you made mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics
governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF),
to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was
called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
</P>
<P>
"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he
said." She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in
every aspect of her life."
</P>
<P>
The media also has an important role to play, he said, they
should protect her instead of crucifying her.
</P>
<P>
Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a
personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold
medal since the beginning of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big
mistake," Dr. Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken. It's exetremely
important for us to know where she got it."
</P>
<P>
Stonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an
anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the
competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.
