   Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are
encouraged, for two distinctly different reasons, that two new
trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick
people. One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the
patients. But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder
of whom the drugs were not intended for: healthy people who use
them in ways that can destroy their health.
</P>
<P>
   The trials, reported last week, found that taking anabolic
steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain
some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result
of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York
University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use
of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting
away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were
developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build
bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance. The latter
include baseball's new home-run king, Mark McGwire, who says he
regularly takes androstenedione, a precursor steroid that quickly
becomes anabolic once taken into the body. Professional baseball,
unlike other sports, has not banned this substance. Medical experts
say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough
to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken
10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
</P>
<P>
   These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone, the
hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle
tissue, facial hair and a deep voice. Testosterone's effect as a
muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French
physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, who in 1889 injected
animal extracts into a dog and then into himself. At the time, he
hypothesized that added testosterone would be good for human
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening, but he
turned out to be onto something, as history has shown,'' Wadler
said. The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace
the body's normal supply of the hormone, which can be depleted by
disease, and to help the patient regain strength, Wadler said in
``Drugs and the Athlete'' (Oxford Press), regarded as the
definitive textbook on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Goldberg, a consulting physician for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, expressed similar concern about the expanding use of
steroids, especially among teen-agers. Adolescent females are now
the fastest growing group of users. With a colleague, Dr. Diane
Elliot, Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in
31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was
reduced by a reported 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinical trials of anabolic steroids for kidney-dialysis
and HIV patients, low doses were used to reverse previously
uncontrollable weight loss, which has been associated with sharply
reduced life spans among these groups. The patients, in the two
separate studies reported last week in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, were given the steroids in conjunction with
exercise programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of patients increased muscle mass significantly more
than a group given a placebo, and increased their abilities to do
more exercise faster while becoming less fatigued. More studies are
needed to determine how much and for how long steroids can be
safely used, the doctors who directed the studies said. But they
pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic
performance, those who take steroids must ask: What is a safe dose
and when does a dose become dangerous? The second question is being
urgently studied at a number of major institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wadler said, all science really knows on the
subject is this: It has been found safe to increase the amount of
testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among
sick people whose supply has become depleted. But at some level
above this, the substitutes can have disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The list of problems doctors cite is very long: liver tumors,
uncontrollably violent behavior, elevated cholesterol, enlarged
veins in the liver that cause fatal bleeding, permanent stunting of
growth in adolescents, and blood clotting that leads to premature
stroke and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The list of less serious but nevertheless undesirable effects is
also long and includes large breasts in men and beards in women.
