MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Spanish pole vaulter Dana
Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid
nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard tested positive at the European Championships in
Budapest on August 16, an IAAF spokesman said, adding "but all the
business is currently in the hands of the Spanish federation."
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Spanish federation said that there were a
number of discrepancies surrounding Cervantes' positive sample.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes took the test at her own request after she was not
randomly selected in the qualifying rounds of the championship
where she set a Spanish national record and eventually finished 11
th in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Spanish federation) asked us to respect the athlete'
s confidentiality in this case, which would have been broken if we
published her name, although we have been assured by the Spanish
federation that she will not compete until the case is clarified,"
the IAAF spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
If Cervantes' positive test is confirmed, she could be banned
from the sport for two years.
