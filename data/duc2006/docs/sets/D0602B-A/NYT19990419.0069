 MARATHON-PIPPIG-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since the day she sailed her way into this city's heart
by finishing a sparkling second in the 1990 Boston Marathon, her US
debut after leaving East Germany, marathoning brought Uta Pippig
little but joy and success. Even the setbacks _ the worst being
forced to drop out of the 1996 Olympics with a leg injury _ seemed
temporary, a brief chop on life's ocean that soon would calm again
as Pippig resumed her voyage toward immortality in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how could anything swamp an athlete who earned her
third straight Boston Marathon victory, as she did at the 100th
running in 1996, by coming from nowhere in the last miles while
suffering from stomach cramps and relentless diarrhea?
</P>
<P>
   Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the
German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition
drug test. Unable to compete during the suspension and facing a
two-year ban if found guilty, Pippig suddenly finds herself looking
for a lifeline to save her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish any person on earth this,'' said Pippig last
fall, shortly after the suspension. ``I know I didn't do anything.
It's hard. It's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippig's forced exile from the roads hasn't kept the
longtime Boston favorite out of town this weekend. On Saturday,
looking fit and relaxed, she smiled for photos at the Boston
Athletic Association's annual breakfast for past champions. Monday,
as she did last year while taking what she thought would be a short
break from marathoning, she will be doing television commentary for
Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her uncertain situation, Pippig said recently that she
was looking forward to race day. ``I can't miss it, you know,'' she
said. ``It's too special.'' The same goes for the city: ``You
should go where you feel supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she sighed, ``I wish I could run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pippig's contract with Nike expired in December and
has not been renewed. (``Given that she's not racing and not able
to actually compete, there is no reason to sit down and discuss a
contract at this point,'' said Dave Mingey, a company spokesman,
who nonetheless added, ``We of course stand by Uta until her appeal
process has been exhausted.'') She is paying her own legal fees,
and already has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance
fees and likely prize money.
</P>
<P>
   And, there is no immediate end in sight. Six months after the
suspension was handed down, the commission in Germany that is
investigating her case still has not set a hearing date. If found
guilty, the three-time Boston champion and two-time Olympian could
be banned from competition for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very often asking my people what is going on,'' said
Helmut Digel, president of the German federation, the Deutscher
Leichtathletik Verband, ``because this situation is for both
parties not a good one. It is very important the period of
suspension shouldn't last too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays may be due to questions about both science and
procedure. As in the nearly three-year-old Mary Slaney case, it is
unclear whether the test is even valid in women. (Slaney was
cleared by a USA Track &AMP; Field panel of a similar doping violation,
and filed a lawsuit last Tuesday against the United States Olympic
Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation,
charging negligence in handling the case.) In Pippig's case,
matters have been complicated by an unexplained switch in her two
urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   For years, rumors have swirled inside the running community
about Pippig's high training mileage and rapid recovery after
races; a training routine some fellow runners in Boulder, where she
now lives, viewed as excessively private; and her East German
background. But until last fall, Pippig never had failed any of the
dozens of drug tests in her career. (She does acknowledge that,
while still living in East Germany in 1984, she briefly took ``some
kind of drug'' that her trainer told her was vitamins, but stopped
within a few weeks after her parents, both physicians, investigated
and told her to stop.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of a sad thing,'' Pippig said of the
accusations. ``But I feel sorry for them. People who say this can
be jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   The test Pippig did fail, which showed an abnormal ratio of
testosterone to epitestosterone in her urine, is by no means
universally trusted. The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male
sex hormone, to epitestosterone, an inactive metabolite that is
used as a marker, is 6 to 1; anything above that is considered to
indicate the possible use of testosterone as a
performance-enhancing anabolic steroid. But because the test cannot
distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested
testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has
taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark
McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a ratio up to 10 to 1 still is considered to
be in a gray area. According to Pippig, not only was her ratio 9.2
to 1, but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but
rather to low epitestosterone, perhaps resulting from a number of
conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been
battling since her epic run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical about the validity of the test, especially in
women,'' said Dr. Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and
gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who has sent a letter
to the German federation on Pippig's behalf. ``This test has been
most widely used in male athletes, and then it's been applied to
females kind of by analogy. In my mind, when we finally work out
the details we will abandon it as a test for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in question, Barbieri believes, are the effects on
the t/e ratio of oral contraceptives _ which Pippig was taking at
the time _ and medical conditions involving the bowel, through
which the hormones are cycled. Pippig was hospitalized for tests
after the episode during the 1996 Marathon, and said that
intestinal problems, including diarrhea, and a severe hormone
imbalance persisted even up to the time of the drug test last
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I had a lot of problems with my intestinal tract
during the last years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pippig's case, questions of procedure also have arisen. When
urine is collected for testing, samples are placed in two bottles,
marked ``A'' and ``B,'' and then placed into containers also marked
``A'' and ``B.'' After her test last April 23, said Pippig, she
placed the correct bottles into the matching containers herself,
and then she, her coach and companion Dieter Hogen, and the test
controller all signed to confirm the protocol was done correctly.
But when the ``A'' container was opened April 29 in a German
laboratory, said Pippig, the ``B'' sample was found inside,
leaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federation said, `It must have been you,' '' said Pippig.
``But . . . when a controller comes you do everything very clear
and slow. Six eyes who look to the same bottle, the same container,
the same paper . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mistake in our home,'' insisted Hogen.
</P>
<P>
   And none by the federation, insisted Digel. ``We got the
information that the test was positive, and that is why we made our
decision to suspend,'' he said. ``We are not responsible for the
collection of the sample, not responsible for the containers, not
responsible for the transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   If mistakes were made in the lab, Digel said, it is the lab's
responsibility, not the federation's.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Pippig?
</P>
<P>
   ``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent
testing of them in the wrong order, according to international
rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,''
said Dr. Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New
York University School of Medicine and lead author of the textbook
``Drugs and the Athlete.'' ``If all these things can be proved,
case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the case is not yet closed, and so at noon Monday Pippig
will be on TV rather than the starting line. Still, she remains
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows I'm not guilty,'' she said. ``I will run
again. Nothing will change for me.''
