<HEADLINE> IAAF Urges National Federations to Suspend Sotomayor, Ottey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) has pressed for the national
federations of Cuba and Jamaica to impose ban on high jumper
Javier Sotomayor and sprinter Merlene Ottey for doping failures.
</P>
<P>
"It is a normal procedure and we do that in every doping case
as soon as the B samples prove positive too, regardless of the
athlete's fame or celebrity," IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
The urge came as Cuban authorities repeatedly said they would
stand by Sotomayor, the world record holder, who failed a dope
test for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The athletics' world ruling body also prompted the Jamaica
Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) to take action against Ottey,
whose second urine sample had just been tested positive.
</P>
<P>
The JAAA will conduct a hearing by November to determine
whether it will suspend Ottey from competitions for two years.
</P>
<P>
Ottey tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in
Lucerne, Switzerland in July and the IAAF disclosed Thursday that
the 39-year-old sprinter's "B" sample on September 2, the second
urine test, also has tested positive for the drug.
</P>
<P>
"There are international rules regarding athletes who have had
positive dope tests and they should be applied by all national
federations.
</P>
<P>
"But it is up to the national federation to make a decision."
said Reineri.
