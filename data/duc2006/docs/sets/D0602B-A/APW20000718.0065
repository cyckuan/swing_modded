<HEADLINE> Ex-Sports Boss Convicted for Doping  </HEADLINE>

   BERLIN (AP) -- East Germany's former sports chief and his medical
director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret
doping program in the former communist country that turned
promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Ewald, 74, and Manfred Hoeppner, 65, were each convicted
of 20 counts of being accessories to causing bodily harm for
secretly administering steroids to the athletes. The men allegedly
told the athletes they were giving them vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald was sentenced to 22 months probation; Hoeppner was given
18 months. The court found them innocent of more serious charges
that could have brought jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case
suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and
Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those responsible have been called to account,'' said Michael
Lehner, the attorney for the women.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they were considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the communist party's central committee, Ewald was
president of East Germany's sports federation from 1961-88 and of
its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the country ceased
to exist in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In its verdict, the court said Ewald was the ''driving force''
behind the doping program and kept it going with ''merciless
hardness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the
details of the doping program -- including the secrecy rules -- and
distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the
court found.
</P>
<P>
   Both shared responsibility for the ''systematic and overall
doping in (East German) competitive sports,'' from 1974 until the
Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner
because he had apologized to the athletes and cooperated with
prosecutors in other doping cases. Ewald never made a direct
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Former track star Brigitte Michel, who was in court Tuesday,
said she ''can live with'' the verdict even though the men most
likely won't have to serve any time behind bars. They faced a
maximum of two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no verdict anyway that can make up for the damage
suffered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were seeking a conviction on a more serious charge.
They say the drugs caused them to develop excessive body hair and
deep voices and also caused gynecological problems. The baby of one
former athlete was born with deformities allegedly linked to the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said a direct connection could not be established
between the steroids and each individual's specific illness.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany,
with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972
to 40 in 1976. East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming
in 1976 and again in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and others have
been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.
