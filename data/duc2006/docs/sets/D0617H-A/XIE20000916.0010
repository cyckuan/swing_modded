<HEADLINE> Electromagnetic Waves Could Have Downed EgyptAir Plane: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Transport
and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri said on Saturday that he did
not rule out the possibility that EgyptAir Flight 990 was downed
last year by electromagnetic interference.
</P>
<P>
Electromagnetic waves could have confused the computer of the
Boeing 767, leading to the crash of the plane, el-Demiri said.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United
States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on
October 31, killing all 217 people on board. Egyptian and U.S.
investigators released a factual report last month without giving
the cause of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, who was commenting on a report in the New
York Review of Books magazine, said, however, the theory was
speculative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine's report said that electromagnetic
interferences by military radars in the area, over which the
EgyptAir plane was flying, could have caused the sudden shutdown of
its computerized auto pilot, the elevators and engines.
</P>
<P>
El-Demiri said Egypt is still demanding the U.S. to release
additional information on the plane's elevators, which controls the
nose up or down, and to publish radar images, which the U.S.
withheld for reasons of classified military data and might give
clues to the tragic incident.
