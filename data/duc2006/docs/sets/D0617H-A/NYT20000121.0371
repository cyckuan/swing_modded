CRASH INVESTIGATORS LOOKING AT 767 TAIL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part
of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane
as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990,
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure comes just a couple days after the chairman of
EgyptAir told a news conference in Cairo that ``something
happened'' to the tail of the Boeing 767 that caused it to go into
a near supersonic dive before the plane broke up and crashed into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board chairman Jim Hall said investigators from his
agency and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority will examine the
767's elevator system, as well as perform a metallurgic examination
of the plane's engine pylon components.
</P>
<P>
   The elevators are flat panels on the horizontal stabalizer of
the tail that control up and down movements of the plane when the
pilot pushes or pulls on the control stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's statement did not suggest that investigators suspect the
elevator system played a role in the crash, and a Boeing spokesman
said such a review is typical in airline crash investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety board is going through a deliberate and methodical
process as they do on all their investigations, and Boeing
continues to support the investigation,'' said Boeing safety
spokesman John Dern.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of problems with the 767's elevator
system or the engine pylons, Dern said.
</P>
<P>
   All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767-300 died when it plunged
into the Atlantic off the Massachusetts coast on Oct. 31, about 30
minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport on a night flight to
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have found nothing in an analysis of the cockpit
voice recorder that would point toward a bomb or a mechanical
problem as the cause of its crash.
</P>
<P>
   Radio communication between the flight crew and air traffic
controllers was routine, and at no time did a member of the crew
advise controllers of either an emergency or a mechanical problem
or concern.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plane's other black box, the flight data
recorder, does not indicate there was an explosion or mechanical
problem.
</P>
<P>
   That points to another cause, and the leading theory is that the
plane was brought down by a deliberate act of the backup copilot.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Friday, Hall blasted as ``wrong'' a published
report this week that quoted unnamed government officials as saying
a mechanical problem has all but been ruled out as the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``NTSB is disturbed to see that again this week unidentified
sources were used as the basis of a news report purporting to have
informed knowledge of our work,'' Hall said in a statement released
late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As is often the case in these matters, the story was wrong. No
hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted, and
the activities that I have outlined indicate that there is much
that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, with no evidence the crash was an accident, Hall
was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI _ further
fueling the theory of pilot suicide _ when the Egyptian government
strenuously objected.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the safety board has said little about how the
investigation is going.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said substantial portions of the wings, tail, fuselage and
an engine had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Friday that ``no decision has been reached at this
point whether further wreckage recovery will ultimately be
necessary, and both agencies (the safety board and the Egyptian
Civil Aviation Authority) agree that additional work needs to be be
accomplished before a final decision can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said both agencies also believe that ``aircraft and
operational system issues'' must be investigated further.
