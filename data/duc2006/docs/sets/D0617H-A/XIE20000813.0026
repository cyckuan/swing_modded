<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigators Urged to Interview Jordanian Pilot Over EgyptAir Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Pilots Association chief
Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last
October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they
saw a shooting fireball near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
The testimony of the German and Jordanian pilots must be heard
regarding their sighting of missile-like bodies in the same place
the Egyptian plane went down, Murad told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to documents released on Friday by the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a Royal Jordanian co-pilot saw
a fireball in the sky on the same day after leaving the same
airport as the doomed EgyptAir flight.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of Flight RJ262 from New York's John F. Kennedy
airport on October 31 last year reported that his co-pilot made the
sighting shortly after the takeoff while he had his head down.
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot said that he saw a fireball like a shooting star
passing ahead at the Jordanian plane very close from right to left
going down, the pilot wrote, as cited by Egyptian investigators in
the NTSB documents.
</P>
<P>
The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks
after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path
clearance as the EgyptAir plane.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Egyptian Pilots Association asked for the pilots
to be interviewed again and accused U.S. investigators of
deliberately ignoring problems that hold the key to explaining the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Murad joined Egyptian investigators in demanding the release of
classified data regarding three high-speed radar images passing
near EgyptAir Flight 990 just before it began its dive into the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
"The absence of this information removes the credibility of the
American investigators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato has
complained the withholding by the U.S. side the radar information
for reasons of classified military data.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the
characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil
aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the
analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the
plane, he wrote in a letter to the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration in June. The letter was included in the
investigation documents.
</P>
<P>
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
