<HEADLINE> Egypt Demands U.S. Radar Information on EgyptAir Flight Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian aviation officials have
demanded that the United States provide detailed radar information
on last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash to explain high-speed
radar images near the plane in its final moments.
</P>
<P>
A review of the 1,665 pages of documents about relevant
investigations revealed a letter from Egyptian Civil Aviation
Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato, who complained the withholding
by the U.S. side of the radar information, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the documents, which were made public on Friday in the U.S.
and presented on the website of the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), Kato did not give credence to a theory that
the plane was downed by a missile, but stressed the need to
investigate fully what the Flight 990 crew might have seen.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after taking off from the New York International Airport on October
31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The probe into this tragedy has produced radar data showing
three high-speed returns in the area of, and along the path of, the
Flight 990. The data shows these returns crossing the plane's path
just before it began its dive, Kato wrote to U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) on June 18.
</P>
<P>
He said that air traffic controllers had cleared the Flight 990
to pass through military "Warning Areas 506 and 105A" just prior to
the accident.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the
characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil
aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis
of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
Kato added that it was apparent from the air traffic control
transcript that no FAA controller was actually watching the Flight
990 at the time of the accident and for several minutes after.
</P>
<P>
The continuing Egyptian concerns appeared to question why NTSB
staff had concluded that "there were no unresolved safety issues,"
as asserted Friday by NTSB chairman Jim Hall, who released the
documents at a news conference.
