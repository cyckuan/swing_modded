WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Radar tapes continued to
show contact with an EgyptAir plane for about 90 seconds after it
had begun a dramatic dive towards the Atlantic Ocean, the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The information provided by Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB,
indicated the plane plummeted from its cruise altitude of 9,900
meters down to 5,730 meters in 36 seconds, and then at least some
part of it remained visible on radar for a much longer period of
time.

<P>
"We do not know at this point what caused the crash," Hall said
at a press conference. "We are beginning what may be a long
investigation."
</P>
<P>
All the 217 people on board are feared dead as the EgyptAir
Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed early Sunday off Nantucket,
Massachusetts State in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of survivors
from the crash.
</P>
<P>
Flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off from
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19 a.m.
local time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from radar
screen at 2 a.m. (0600 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Hall said the government of Egypt has asked the U.S. government
to take the lead in the crash investigation. EgyptAir and Egyptian
government officials were heading to the United States to assist
in the investigation, he added.
