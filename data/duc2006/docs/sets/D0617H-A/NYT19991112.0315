   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ The EgyptAir flight that crashed
on Oct. 31 went into an extreme dive, making the passengers
weightless and pitching the nose down at a 40-degree angle, before
the nose pulled back up and subjected the plane and its passengers
to two and a half times the normal force of gravity, the chairman
of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said many of the details released Friday might reflect
an airplane that was in an emergency, but still under control. But
the chairman, James E. Hall, said that the information from the
flight data recorder also showed that both engines had been
switched off from the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots experienced with the Boeing 767, the type of plane that
crashed, said they could not understand why the engines had been
turned off, with the information now in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said that the elevators, the adjustable surfaces on
the horizontal tail that are used to raise or lower the nose, moved
to uneven positions. It is not possible for the crew to command
such a movement on the 767, according to pilots, and the fact that
the elevators moved out of unison indicates a major malfunction.
But it was not clear from the information released so far whether
this was a cause of the accident or a malfunction along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, about 60 miles from Nantucket, Mass., killed all 217
people on board. Other than a small quantity of debris and human
remains, searchers have not recovered anything except one of the
two ``black boxes,'' the flight data recorder, which they are still
analyzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, these data raise many questions,'' Hall said. ``I
can assure you they have raised questions in the minds of the NTSB
and the investigators. We cannot at this time explain the
circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in
the flight profile I have just described, and we will not attempt
to speculate about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the second ``black box,'' the cockpit voice
recorder, might explain the circumstances. The Navy believes it has
located that device on the sea floor, within a pile of wreckage
from the plane, but a robot submarine was still trying to retrieve
it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For law enforcement authorities, Friday's information raised
questions that deepened the mystery of EgyptAir even as it yielded
few clues to guide the inquiry into whether anyone might
intentionally have interfered with the flight or tried to bring
down the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the course of their investigation
they had examined the recent activities, background, medical
history and emotional stability of the crew members and passengers.
But so far, the officials said, those inquiries had not provided
useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the officials said that while the FBI inquiry was far
from over, investigators were faced with dwindling leads and,
increasingly frustrated over their inability to help explain the
crash, were anxiously awaiting recovery of the cockpit voice
recorder.
