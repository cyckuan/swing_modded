<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Chief "99 Percent Sure" Flight 990 Downed by Technical Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim
Rayan said on Thursday he is "99 percent sure" that a technical
problem rather than a suicidal pilot brought down an EgyptAir plane
last October.
</P>
<P>
Rayan told a news conference that he is almost certain that
there is something wrong in the elevator control system, citing as
evidence a Boeing service bulletin earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The elevators are movable panels on the horizontal tail surface
which direct the aircraft's nose up or down.
</P>
<P>
The plane's manufacturer, Boeing Co., urged on Tuesday all
airlines flying the Boeing 767s to perform a special inspection to
ensure the integrity of parts that help move elevators, but said
the stepped-up inspection is not connected to the crash probe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last
week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on
October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing
all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators hinted the relief co-pilot, Gameel el-
Batouti, "brought down the plane in a suicidal act." The Egyptian
side has strongly opposed the speculations, stressing technical
failure might cause the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and U.S. investigators "were seeking to know exactly
what happened to the EgyptAir plane," Rayan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "has given
credence to the Egyptian theory" that a prevalent malfunction in
the elevator control system could result in a fatal accident,
referring to FAA's decision to intensify inspection of Boeing 767s'
elevator system.
