EGYPTAIR 990 FLIGHT DATA RECORDER RECOVERED  
 (HLW)

   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ A submarine operated by remote
control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the
ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a
crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The container that held the recorder, known as a black box,
showed signs of damage when it was recovered, but the flight
recorder inside seemed to have survived the jetliner's catastrophic
impact and nine days of submersion in salt water, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnetic tape was removed from its protective casing,
cleaned and dried,'' James E. Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday night after investigators
in Washington began evaluating the recorder's condition. ``The tape
has data on it, and NTSB engineers are currently working to extract
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the box, and the condition of its contents,
appears to have provided the first breaks in what has been a
frustrating case. For much of the past week, investigators and
mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused
delays in the search for the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary radar data has shown that the plane fell
precipitously, and three lobstermen reported hearing a strange
rumble where the plane slammed into the ocean's surface. But until
the recovery of the data recorder on Tuesday, virtually no other
information had been available. EgyptAir's pilots reported no
trouble over their radios before or during the dive, and the
wreckage recovered to date has revealed little more than that the
great airplane _ a Boeing 767 with a wingspan of 156 feet and a
length of 176 feet _ was reduced to bits when it struck the sea.
The crash killed all 217 passengers and crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder _ another, the
cockpit voice recorder, remains missing on the sea floor _ could
provide key insights into the crash. ``In any investigation, the
most important information comes from the recorders,'' Hall said.
``They can save several steps in the investigatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder is designed to preserve conversations
among the pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit, including the
noise from plane alarms, its two engines, or any obvious mechanical
problems. The flight data recorder is designed to record more than
150 categories of information that shows how the plane was flying,
how the pilots were handling it and how the aircraft's systems were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he hopes the recorder ``will paint a picture of what
this airplane was doing in its last minutes, and seconds, before
this tragedy occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The black box was discovered before dawn in 245 feet of water by
the Deep Drone, a robot submarine that was deployed and controlled
from the Grapple, a Navy salvage ship. The Deep Drone had resumed
searching after a more capable robot, known as Magnum and deployed
from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest, damaged its
fiber optic cable on undersea wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of lifting the black box aboard the Grapple, the
Navy flew it by helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,
where it was transferred to Washington. Agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, who are treating all debris recovered from
the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the
investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was
brought down by a crime or terrorism, accompanied the recorder on
its trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, working in moderate seas of 5 to 7 feet, planned to
continue searching for the remaining black box through the night
and into Wednesday morning. Retrieving the second recorder is
important because in some past jetliner accidents, information from
the two flight recorders, together, has provided a level of detail
that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after
takeoff from Lima in 1996, the cockpit voice recorder captured the
desperate conversation of the two pilots. ``Everything has gone,
all the instruments went to (expletive),'' the captain said, as the
plane dropped into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation
problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known
as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and
determine air speed. The static ports are crucial because speed
cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at
night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing
the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers
had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape
when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it _ an
oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from
the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved
insufficient. In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of
Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into
the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air
traffic controllers on the ground.
