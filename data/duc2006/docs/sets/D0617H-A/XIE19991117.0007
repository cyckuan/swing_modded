<HEADLINE> FBI Takes Over EgyptAir 990 Crash Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) of the United States is taking over the
investigation of the crash of EgyptAir 990 from the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators doubt that the plane crash, which resulted in the
death of all 217 aboard, may have been caused by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation found that someone in the cockpit
uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged and the
plane started its fatal plunge.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. rules, the NTSB is in charge of the
investigation of air transportation accidents while the FBI has
jurisdiction over destruction of an aircraft and crimes committed
aboard an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
If investigators conclude the plane was brought down by foul
play, they will try to determine whether the perpetrator was
assisted by a terrorist group in a suicide plot or acted alone
because of a personal problem, the source close to the probe said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
off the Massachusettes coast 40 minutes after takeoff from the
Kennedy International Airport in New York on October 31.
</P>
<P>
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the ocean floor
by a remote-operated robot Saturday after a two-week search.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about a possible hijacking, crew fight or pilot
suicide has lingered because the flight data recorder shows that
the plane's autopilot was turned off, the aircraft put into a
dive, the throttles cut back and the engines shut off.
