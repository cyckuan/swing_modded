<HEADLINE> NTSB Releases EgyptAir Crash Report  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts
in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely
to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last
fall off the New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have suggested that a co-pilot of the
jetliner may have deliberately plunged the plane into the sea,
killing all 217 people aboard on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been vehemently rejected by Egyptian officials,
who contend that mechanical failure is the probable cause, or
possibly even a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
   The new reports from the National Transportation Safety Board,
being released Friday, compile the findings of investigators in
such areas as human performance, aircraft structure, power plants,
maintenance, air traffic control and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and
do not include any analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The probable result will be each side finding evidence to
support its contention as the investigation continues into the
reason the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea off the coast of the
Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder
contained words that may have been a prayer just before the plane
went into its plunge. That led to speculation that co-pilot Gameel
El-Batouty may have deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   El-Batouty had been investigated by a New York hotel's security
staff for a number of incidents that allegedly included exposing
himself, USA Today reported in its Friday editions, quoting sources
it did not name.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were contained in FBI investigative reports into
the backgrounds of the plane's crew members, and some of the
reports were expected to be released Friday, the sources told the
newspaper. However, investigators could not determine whether
El-Batouty's behavior at the hotel had any connection with the
crash, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, El-Batouty's family angrily denounced the published
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are running out of things to say, so they are ruining the
guy's reputation,'' Walid El-Batouty, the co-pilot's nephew, told
The Associated Press. ''They are trying to raise anything to divert
people from the real reason (for the crash).''
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no
radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other
aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed. The last
word was a routine ''good morning'' signoff.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall has testified before Congress that the
movements of the plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action
on the part of one of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, information from the flight data recorder released early
in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off
before it was put into a steep dive. Both engines on the Boeing 767
were also turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that theory, families of the crew members have filed
suit against the plane's manufacturer, Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have focused on possible problems with the
plane's elevators, a pair of small wing-like surfaces at the tail
of the jet that control the up-or-down angle of the nose.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during
the rapid descent, indicating a major problem. The elevators are
designed to operate in unison. Investigators are trying to
determine if the split was caused by the plane's breakup, a jamming
problem in one of the elevators, crew panic or even a struggle for
control by two people in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The last contact with the flight came at 1:47 a.m. EST. The
pilot's last words after being asked to switch to another radio
frequency: ''One-two-five-nine-two, good day,'' followed by an
unintelligible utterance, then, ''Nine-nine-zero heavy, good
morning.'' The heavy referred to his big aircraft, a Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that something was wrong came seven minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The New York air traffic controller said, ''EgyptAir 990, radar
contact lost, recycle transponder squawk one-seven-one-two.'' It
was a declaration that the plane no longer appeared on radar
screens and a request for it to send out a signal. But that and
several other efforts failed to get a response. The FAA estimates
that the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four minutes after
its last transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also prompted a dispute over who is
responsible for paying for the costly investigation, which has
included recovering most of the crash plane from the seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt gave the United States $5 million in June to help pay for
the search and rescue efforts. That country's share of the cost was
expected to be $10.6 million and officials promised to pay the
balance expeditiously.
