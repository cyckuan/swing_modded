   Hitchcock would have had a field day with this one.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of EgyptAir 990 is shaping up as one of the great
whodunits in the annals of aviation disasters. That is why
Americans have plunged into this terrifying tale, discussing it
last week as they gathered around fax machines and dinner tables at
a pitch not seen after the TWS and Swissair crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Why the intensity? Primarily because authorities have introduced
the possibility that a human _ not some mechanical failure _ caused
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the story also generates such heat because supporters and
opponents of this view offer equally compelling arguments defending
their respective cases.
</P>
<P>
   Tension forged from competing versions of events crackle through
the story. Either the National Transportation Safety Board or the
Egyptian government is utterly wrong about what happened in the
skies off of Nantucket early in the morning of October 31.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Egypt is America's best friend in the
Mideast. Its reputation is at stake. So is ours. As dramas go, you
can't do much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the TWA nor Swissair crash carried this kind of torque,
notwithstanding the early charges of a missile attack on the TWA
plane that have been long since discredited. Here, in contrast, the
NTSB raises the specter of a villain lurking in the cockpit _
malignant flesh and blood prepared to commit suicide and kill 217
souls with malice aforethought.
</P>
<P>
   This macabre vision is further infused by the rampant fears in
the West of terrorists committing horrific acts in the name of
Islam. And terrorism is indeed another possible explanation for the
crash. There were over 30 Egyptian military officers on the flight,
including three brigadier generals.
</P>
<P>
   According to one NTRB source quoted early in the investigation,
the presence of this critical mass of military elite immediately
raised questions of foul play. Under that theoretical line of
reasoning, if co-pilot Gamil El Batouty really did cause the crash,
he could have done so for political rather than personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir 990 story is also personal in a way that TWA and
Swissair were not. We know the name of the man who may _ and it's
only ``may;'' we don't know anything for sure yet _ have
intentionally put the Boeing 767 into its fatal dive. There has
been massive media coverage of his family. We have learned that a
daughter has lupus and, according to a son, the father was bringing
automobile tires he purchased in the U.S back to Egypt with him. We
have even seen his Cairo apartment, and heard his wife describe
their close relationship. If he is the culprit, al-Batouti will be
an infamous one _ not another shadowy killer who goes down with the
plane or somehow slips into Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The ``criminal act'' scenario is the worst nightmare of every
flier who has ever harbored doubts about the guys in the cockpit,
any cockpit. How many of us will stare long and hard at our flight
crew the next time we board the New York shuttle? Is the pilot
having a bad day, we wonder? If nothing else, this plane crash has
buttressed the notion that just because you're paranoid doesn't
mean they're not out to get you.
</P>
<P>
   United States diplomats have been concerned about the speed with
which the NTSB has floated the idea that El Batouty or another
pilot may have sent the plane into a suicide plunge. So has Frank
Wisner, Jr., a former ambassador to Egypt and luminary of our
foreign policy establishment, who cautions against the suicide
theory. The NTSB is couching its statements with conditional verbs
as the case becomes increasingly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't know how to assess the significance of what
El-Batouty said _ or is believed to have said _ in Arabic before
the plane began its precipitous dive. Dueling experts fight over
meaning, and authorities dutifuly nod to ``cultural differences.''
Are our experts right or did they miss subleties that Egyptian
experts will detect?
</P>
<P>
   Americans who care about US relations with Egypt in particular,
and the Arab world in general, know that our government has to get
this right. The rest of us must probe the Egyptian charge that the
American media has rushed to judgment in condemning a senior pilot
of their national airline. Are the Cairenes right here, or are they
experiencing a national case of denial? Their cause was not helped
by an Eyptian government official who told CNN that there is a
``triangle of death'' over the Atlantic that swallowed TWA,
Swissair, JFK Jr. and now EgyptAir. Such fantasies rob this
investigation of the objectivity it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Americans lean toward the NTSB suicide theory because
we find the NTSB investigators credible. They are, after all, our
investigators. Besides, there appears to be no hint of mechanical
error.
</P>
<P>
   Given the stunning developments that have already appeared,
though, we are prepared for more precipitous plot changes in this
yarn. They could materialize in the findings of an exhaustive
US-Egyptian review of the voice recorder to be completed this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we remain glued to this story that gnaws at us.
