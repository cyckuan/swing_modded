NTSB CALLS FOR VIDEO CAMERAS IN COCKPITS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Saying that the EgyptAir crash may never be fully
understood from the black boxes and the wreckage, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday evening that all planes
should have cockpit video recorders, and that the power switches
for the cameras, as well as the voice and data recorders, should be
moved to where the crews cannot reach them.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted unanimously to recommend to the Federal Aviation
Administration that recorders holding two hours of video be
required in all new planes beginning in 2003, and be installed in
older planes by 2005. It said the planes should have enough cameras
in each cockpit to see all the cockpit screens and other displays,
and all actions by the crews in working the controls
</P>
<P>
   Pilot unions oppose cameras as a violation of their workplace
privacy. The Safety Board said, though, that it would treat the
video images just as it treats the cockpit voice recorder tapes,
playing them only for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The board cited several crashes where cockpit images would have
been helpful, including two brought down by smoke or fire, Valujet
592, a DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11, 1996, and
Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 that crashed off Halifax, Nova
Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in Egyptair 990, which crashed on Oct. 31, 1999, as the
board delicately put it, ``questions still remain as to the exact
environment in the cockpit prior to the upset.'' Publicly, the
board has said only that investigators believe that the crash may
have been a deliberate act, but its own investigators, and those of
other Federal agencies, believe that the plunge from an uneventful
cruise fight, which killed all 217 people aboard the Boeing 767,
may have been a suicide by the relief co-pilot.
