<HEADLINE> Search for EgyptAir "Black Box" Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators on
Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder
from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight
990 crashed October 31.
</P>
<P>
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two "Black Boxes",
was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts
of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The recorder's tape contains parameters measuring air speed,
altitude, settings of engines and many other data, valuable to
investigators to determine the cause of the accident which killed
all 217 on Board.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound plane plunged some 60 miles south off Nantucket
Island, Massachusetts soon after it took off from New York.
Investigators still wonder whether it was a result of mechanical
defects, operational errors or human sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Two remotely operated vehicles containing sophisticated robots
were used to catch the data recoder from depths of more than 70
meters.
