<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Crash Probe May Be Handed Over to Another Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official
raised the possibility Monday of handing over the probe leadership
of the EgyptAir Flight 990 to another agency, hinting that the
plane was possibly downed by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the
evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, whether or not
this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)," said NTSB Chairman
Jim Hall at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and
stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by
mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew
fight or pilot suicide.
</P>
<P>
If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the
investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
off the Massachusetts coast on October 31, killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
Hall met with FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and other officials
Monday to discuss whether there was enough evidence to open a
criminal investigation, an Associated Press report quoted a law
enforcement official as saying.
