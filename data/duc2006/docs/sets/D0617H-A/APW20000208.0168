<HEADLINE> NTSB To Interview EgyptAir Pilot  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he
has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be
interviewed by U.S. accident investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, whose agency is
investigating the crash that killed 217 people off the coast of Massachusetts,
announced the decision Tuesday to send two staffers to London. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir pilot Hamdi Hanafi Taha sought asylum last week after landing a
plane at London's Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials say Taha has no special knowledge about the cause of the
Oct. 31 crash near the island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither American nor Egyptian investigators have released any official
findings on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. sources have speculated the plane's co-pilot, who died in the
crash, deliberately brought the jet down. Egyptian authorities hotly dispute
that theory. They say the most likely cause is an unexplained problem in the
plane's tail section.
