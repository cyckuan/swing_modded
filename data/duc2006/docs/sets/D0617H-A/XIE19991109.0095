NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- One of the "black boxes" of
the plane on the EgyptAir Flight 990 has been recovered, U.S.
searchers announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Black Boxes" are the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder, two vital instruments to help determine the cause of a
plane accident.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed
the find, without identifying which recorder was recovered.
</P>
<P>
The U.S Navy waged a round-the-clock search on Monday for the
boxes, eight days after the Boeing 767 plane crashed some 60 miles
off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, shortly after it took off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
All 217 people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Two robots have been used during the operation in an effort to
find and catch the boxes amid the wreckage at the Atlantic seabed
80 meter deep.
