<HEADLINE> EgyptAir 990 Victims Identified  </HEADLINE>

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The remains of the first victims of
EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the
plane plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Medical, dental and fingerprint records were used to determine
the identities of the 14 victims -- all U.S. residents -- paving the
way for families to bury their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island
of Nantucket, killing the 217 people on board. A salvage ship
worked for a week in December, raising the wreckage and remains off
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island medical examiner's office has been overseeing
the identification process. It has been working with 6,000 tissue
fragments and a smaller number of body parts. Only 1,300 fragments
are suitable for DNA testing, and results may not be ready for 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was held in November in Newport for all the
relatives and many already held private funerals.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board estimated that 70
percent of the aircraft, including one engine, and sections of the
wings, tail and body, was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would
be raised. A civilian ship with an underwater robot is scheduled to
begin the task March 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures
underwater, but it can also help if we have it out of the water to
get a closer look at it,'' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit
voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said
in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could
have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly
convinced the jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must
conduct more studies before they settle on a cause.
