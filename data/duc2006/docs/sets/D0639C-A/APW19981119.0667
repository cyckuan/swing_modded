Group says Bosnian Serbs may have used nerve gas at Srebrenica

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Human rights investigators
Thursday called for an international investigation into claims that
Bosnian Serb forces may have fired nerve gas at Muslims fleeing
Srebrenica in 1995.
	   After speaking to about 35 survivors of the attack on the
Bosnian enclave, Washington-based Human Rights Watch said their
accounts suggest Bosnian Serbs fired the BZ nerve agent at the
refugees.
	   Officially called 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, BZ is a nerve agent
similar to the drug LSD which produces hallucinations in victims.
	   Witnesses said Serb mortar shells released a low-hanging cloud
of colored smoke. Shortly after the shelling, refugees began
hallucinating; some killed friends, others committed suicide, Human
Rights Watch said in a press release.
	   However, the group conceded that its two-year investigation had
failed to turn up any physical evidence of a gas attack such as
chemical traces in shells or on the clothes of victims.
	   It handed its findings to the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in
The Hague which is investigating alleged atrocities in Srebrenica.
	   In a press release, Human Rights Watch said it wanted an
international investigation ``to bring justice to the victims,
strengthen international controls over the proliferation of
chemical weapons and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former
Yugoslavia.''
	   Tribunal spokesman Jim Landale confirmed investigators would
check the claims.
	   The U.N. court has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, for
genocide for allegedly masterminding the mass murder of Muslims
following the July 1995 takeover of Srebrenica, a U.N.-designated
``safe haven'' in eastern Bosnia.
	   The detailed indictment against Karadzic and Mladic makes no
mention of the use of nerve gas. Neither man is in custody.
	   Human Rights Watch claimed that the former Yugoslav People's
Army, known as the JNA, had BZ gas in its arsenals before the 1991
breakup of Yugoslavia.
	   Although the Serb-dominated JNA officially pulled out of the war
in Bosnia in early 1992, it left much of its military hardware in
the hands of the Bosnian Serb Army, which was responsible for the
takeover of Srebrenica.
	   Human Rights Watch also claimed that U.S. authorities
investigated the nerve gas allegations but never published their
findings.
	   Thousands of Muslims are believed to have been massacred in the
aftermath of the Bosnian Serb takeover of Srebrenica. A tribunal
judge who read a summary of evidence of the killings said it
contained ``scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human
history.''
