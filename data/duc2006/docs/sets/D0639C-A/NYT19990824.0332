BELGIAN SAYS SERBS USED GAS ON KOSOVARS

   UNITED NATIONS _ A Belgian scientist is reported to have found
evidence that Yugoslavia used chemical weapons on ethnic Albanian
fighters and civilians in Kosovo during the months of the NATO
bombing and before peacekeepers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   His findings were immediately challenged by U.S. and U.N.
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Janes Defence Weekly says in its latest issue, to be published
Wednesday in London, that the findings showed that Kosovar
Albanians were attacked with BZ gas or a similar compound, which
does not kill but causes disorientation and confusion. Its use is
prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian scientist, Aubin Heyndrickx, director of the
International Reference University Laboratories in Ghent, went to
the Balkans in May to take samples from Kosovar Albanians in two
hospitals, one in Kosovo and one in Albania. The rebels had bases
in northern Albania, and Serbs fired over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Heyndrickx was invited by the Kosovo Liberation Army, Janes
said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the samples led Heyndrickx to conclude that a
cocktail of agents may have been used in shells fired in Kosovo,
where, he said, people reported that ``hundreds'' had been
affected.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts reacted with skepticism. Heyndrickx, who has done
similar studies in Iran and Angola, did not respond to calls
Tuesday to his home and office seeking more information.
</P>
<P>
   John Parachini, a chemical weapons expert at the Washington
office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said
charges of chemical attacks have been made frequently by all sides
in the decade of civil war in the Balkans. All have been hard to
prove, though experts agree Yugoslavia has such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Monterey Institute in California, Jason Pate, a research
associate in the chemical and biological nonproliferation project,
said BZ can be very hard to detect because there are no lingering
effects, contrary to Heyndrickx's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not really long-term effects from BZ intoxication,
so the soldiers would be able to return to work rather quickly,''
he added. ``But in the short term, it is certainly an effective
tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would not be surprised to learn that BZ had been
used in Kosovo but that proving it would be difficult.
