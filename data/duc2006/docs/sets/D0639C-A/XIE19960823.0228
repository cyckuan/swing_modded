<HEADLINE> Evidence Shows Explosive Detonated on TWA Flight: NY Times (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chemical evidence found from
the wreckage of the TWA Flight 800 led investigators to believe
that an explosive device was detonated to cause the crash, The New
York Times reported in its early Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
Chemists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime
laboratory have found traces of PETN, a chemical component in
plastic explosives, on a piece of wreckage retrieved from the
jet's passenger cabin between rows 17 and 27, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The finding provides evidence that the jetliner was destroyed
by an explosive device, but the Times said the chemical is
commonly found in many bombs and surface-to-air missiles, making
it impossible to know which type of device was involved in the
July 17 crash that killed all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Times said senior investigators were not yet ready to
declare the crash the result of a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at
this point we don't know for sure," according to a source close to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
If the crash is declared a criminal act, it will be the
deadliest crime in American history, surpassing the April 1995
bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168
people.
</P>
<P>
The investigators still hoped to retrieve more wreckage and
were particularly interested in finding metal fragments showing
what investigators call shock waves which are the physical damage
left by a blast that suggests what type of device exploded.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the crash, investigators found preliminary
indications of PETN residue on a piece of the right wing near the
fuselage, but that was not confirmed by a later test at the FBI
lab in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration investigators who probed the Challenger space
shuttle disaster in 1986 were called in Thursday to examine
specific pieces of TWA Flight 800's wreckage.
