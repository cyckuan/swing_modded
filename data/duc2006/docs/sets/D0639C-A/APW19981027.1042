	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the
contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded
the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein,
said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
	   The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the
statement read on state-run television said.
	   A second round of tests on the missile warheads did not provide
further conclusive evidence that Iraq loaded VX on the missiles,
although there were signs that Iraq had cleaned the pieces between
the initial U.S. tests in April and the tests in June and July.
	   Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons
experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with
the initial tests in April that the Iraqis had used the VX for
warheads.
	   Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program,
reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in
stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon.
	   Saadi said the conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts scientific
fact and is ``full of disgraceful scientific fallacies.''
	   Saadi said Iraq never tampered with the warheads. Any attempt
would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad who keep the
warhead fragments under camera surveillance, he said.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _
before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions.
