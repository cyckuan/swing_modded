Dutch government banned export of chemicals to Sudan

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government banned a
shipment of chemicals to Sudan earlier this year because of fears
they might be used to make nerve gas, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   The shipment involved so-called ``dual-use'' chemicals which
have both a civilian and military application, said Economic
Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Paula de Jonge.
	   Although the Dutch exporter wanted to sell the chemicals as raw
materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizer, the ministry
``had indications that it might be used for other ends,'' De Jonge
said.
	   De Jonge would not say which chemicals were named on an April
export application or where in Sudan they were headed. She also
declined to say how the Dutch government decided there was a risk
the chemicals would be used for military ends.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States launched a cruise missile attack
that destroyed a Sudanese factory, which the U.S. government
claimed was making precursors for VX nerve gas.
	   The Sudanese government insists the El Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant manufactured only drugs.
