   VX, the chemical nerve agent that the administration alleges
Sudan was preparing to make, is one of the deadliest nerve agents
known to man, especially when applied to the skin. A 10 milligram
drop on the skin can kill an adult human in 15 minutes.
</P>

   An organophosphate that is chemically related to certain
insecticides, VX interferes with the ability of nerves to
regenerate themselves and to fire again. It causes loss of muscle
control, convulsive seizures, respiratory paralysis and almost
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesized by British scientists who were searching for new
insecticides after World War II, VX can contaminate an area for
days. It is said to be a thousand times more potent than the nerve
agent sarin. U.S. Chemical Corp. announced in its annual report
after VX was standardized in 1957, ``The reign of mustard gas,
which has been called the King of Battle Gases since it was first
used in July 1917, will probably come to an end.''
</P>

   Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference
Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical
Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence
community was ``confident'' that the plant was ``involved in the
production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor
chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example,
VX.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tucker, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons
nonproliferation project at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies, said that there were three likely possibilities for those
agents: the main precursors phosphorous trichloride or phosphorous
pentasulfide, both of which are used in the production of certain
pesticides, and another important ingredient, diisopropyl
ethylamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pesticide plant could be used as a cover for a nerve agent
production facility, although the production equipment would have
to be modified,'' Tucker said.

   Between 1961 to 1968, the United States produced large
quantities of VX, and currently has roughly 4500 tons in its
weapons stockpile. The Soviet Union produced at least that much of
a similar agent called V-gas, and also has vast stockpiles. But
both countries have ratified the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which requires complete destruction of all such stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, however, are suspected of having VX, among them
Iran and Syria. Recent inspections by the U.N. Special Commission
charged with disarming Iraq have revealed that Baghdad produced
large quantities of VX and filled it into SCUD missile warheads.
Iraq has acknowledged that it once had sufficient precursor
chemicals to make nearly 500 tons of VX, but claims that all its VX
stocks have been destroyed.

   A senior administration official said that Osama Bin Laden, the
Saudi-born financier, has been working with the Islamic militant
government in Sudan since 1995 to develop and buy dual use
equipment that can be used to produce VX and other weapons of mass
destruction. Specifically, they said, Bin Laden had been working
with the militant Islamic government in Khartoum to improve Sudan's
chemical capabilities in what the Sudanese call its
``military-industrial complex,'' part of which is said to include
the chemical plant bombed Thursday. According to a February report
published by the House of Representatives' Task Force on Terrorism
&AMP; Unconventional Warfare, Iraq has also provided assistance to
Sudan's covert program to develop chemical weapons, a charge that
the Khartoum government has denied. Specifically, the task force
report charges that Iraq in 1995 helped Sudan build a chemical
weapons plant in Wau, in south-western Sudan, as well as a gas
storage site. Sudanese opposition groups have also charged that
Sudan used Iraqi mustard gas which it has stored since the Gulf war
against rebels, who have been fighting a protracted war against the
Islamic government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   General Wafiq al-Sammarai, former head of Iraqi Military
Intelligence, who defected to the West in 1994, has charged that
Iraq actually used VX gas against Iranian soldiers in the battle of
Fao, one of the fiercest battles in the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. That
allegation has not been confirmed, and experts agree that VX has
only rarely been used.
</P>
<P>
   The only terrorist group known to have used VX is Aum Shinrikyo,
the Japanese cult which staged the attack on the Tokyo subway.
Japanese prosecutors in 1996 charged cult leaders with using VX,
which the cult's guru called a `divine power,'' to kill cult
critics in late 1994 and 1995.
