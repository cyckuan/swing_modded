EXPERTS FIND NO ARMS CHEMICALS AT BOMBED SUDAN PLANT

   WASHINGTON _ Chemists who examined soil, sludge and debris
samples from a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant destroyed in August by
American cruise missiles found no traces of chemical weapon
compounds, according to a scientist hired by the owner of the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, though prepared privately for lawyers for the
owner, who is now seeking redress from the United States, raise new
questions about the government's reliance on tests of soil samples
from the site obtained clandestinely by the CIA. American officials
had said the samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in
the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States attacked the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum and suspected terrorist training camps near Khost,
Afghanistan, on Aug. 20 in an effort to curb the activities of the
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden after the bombings of two American
embassies in East Africa. American officials have said the bin
Laden terrorist network was behind the bombings of the diplomatic
missions in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden has denied any role in
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the new evidence are 13 carefully cataloged
samples taken from the wrecked plant and its grounds late in
October. The sampling project was designed and supervised by Thomas
Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of what we did was to carefully and scientifically
collect samples from a variety of locations and have them analyzed
by one of the top laboratories in the world for this kind of
work,'' Tullius said in an interview. ``What they found was that in
those samples, to the practical limits of scientific detection,
there was no Empta or Empa, its breakdown product.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the new findings, Clinton administration
officials said they stood by their decision to strike the plant.
The officials dismissed the findings of chemists working on behalf
of the plant's owner, Salih Idris, noting that their soil samples
were taken long after the United States obtained its soil from the
site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed
incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while they acknowledged that they did not know that
Idris owned the plant at the time of the attack, other American
officials say they now have strong evidence linking him to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our evidence indicating the presence of a chemical
weapons precursor at this plant,'' said P.J. Crowley, a spokesman
for the National Security Council at the White House. ``We stand by
our evidence linking this plant to Osama bin Laden's network. We
continue to believe that this was an appropriate action to pre-empt
Osama bin Laden from further attacks against the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Several ground locations at the plant were surveyed, along with
interior sites in the plant that were covered by debris and partly
protected from rain. One location, a septic tank, was found intact
and provided what Tullius said was a historical record of the
chemicals flushed through the plant drains.
</P>
<P>
   The lab analysis found that none of the samples contained
detectable levels of Empta, nor did they find Empa, the subsidiary
compound into which Empta rapidly breaks down. Empta, Tullius said,
breaks down within days, but Empa remains in the soil, and even in
small quantities would be detectable for weeks or months after
contact with the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the evaluation of the new soil samples, an
international security company, Kroll Associates, was hired by
Idris' lawyers to conduct a detailed review of the Shifa
controversy. In their report, made available to The New York Times,
Kroll Associates found no evidence of a direct link between Idris
and bin Laden.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scientists and investigators were hired by the law firm of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, which represents Idris, a
Sudanese-born Saudi businessman. The law firm has a long-held
reputation of influence in Democratic circles with partners like
Robert Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman, and Vernon
Jordan, a close friend of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But its credentials have not benefited Idris. The firm's lawyers
have been flatly rebuffed in their efforts to present their
findings to the White House, National Security Council or the
Justice, Treasury and Defense Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been confronted with the problem of proving a series of
negatives that there was no Empta at the plant and that Idris was
not a terrorist,'' said Mark MacDougall, a partner at the law firm.
``We think we've done that with evidence that can be admitted in
court. But to date responsible officials, including at the White
House, have flatly refused to look at the facts. We're sorry about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have not yet decided whether they will sue the
government, in what would probably be complex litigation with an
uncertain outcome. Nevertheless, MacDougall said Idris wanted to
clear his name and unfreeze millions of dollars in bank accounts at
the Bank of America that the Treasury Department's office of
foreign-assets control blocked after the Shifa attack. In addition,
Idris is seeking millions of dollars to replace the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with Western consultants to the factory, employees
and others, the Kroll investigators said they had found no evidence
that the plant had been heavily guarded or that there had been
secret areas in the factory off-limits to outsiders, where chemical
weapons might have been produced or stored. The report concluded
that the plant produced only veterinary medicines and
pharmaceuticals for human consumption. While Al Shifa did export to
Iraq, Kroll found no evidence of a chemical weapons link to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kroll investigation did provide new details about Idris
and confirmed his commercial links to Sudan's Military Industrial
Corp., the government entity that produces weapons for the Sudanese
army. The United States charged that the industrial corporation was
also responsible for chemical weapons production in the country,
and that bin Laden had provided financing for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Kroll report determined that Idris had links to the military
corporation through his other business interests in Sudan, but not
through Al Shifa. Kroll investigators said the industrial
corporation was a powerful military-based organization that reaches
into many parts of the Sudanese economy, including Idris' business
empire.
