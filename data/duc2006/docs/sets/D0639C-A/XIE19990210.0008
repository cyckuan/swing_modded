<HEADLINE> Scientists Find no Chemicals at Bombed Sudan Plant </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists found no traces
of chemical weapons compounds in a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant,
which was destroyed in August by U.S. cruise missiles, the New
Times said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was attacked by the
United States, alleging that its CIA intelligents had
clandestinely collected soil samples from the plant site to find
that these samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in
the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
The attack was conducted on August 20 after two U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were devastated by terrorist
bombs. And Washington decided Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was
behind the bombing and the Sudanese plant was used by bin Laden
to produce chemical weapons compounds.
</P>
<P>
The plant owner, Salih Idris, flatly rejected U.S. allegations
and asked scientists to examine soil, sludge and debris from the
plant in a preparation to sue the United States.
</P>
<P>
The sampling project was designed and supervised by Professor
Thomas D. Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department as
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
Tullius said the point of what the scientists did was
to "carefully and scientifically collect samples from variety of
locations and have them analyzed by one of the top laboratories
in the world for this kind of work."
</P>
<P>
"What they found was that in those samples, to the practical
limits of scientific detection, there was no Empta or Empa, its
breakdown product," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. administration officials dismissed the findings,
noting that their soil samples were taken long after the United
States obtained its soil from the site and long after the
bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
Some other officials said they have strong evidence linking
the plant owner to bin Laden.
