	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States has no reason to oppose
a fact-finding mission to a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant it bombed
last month if it is certain that deadly chemical agents were being
produced there, Sudan's foreign minister said on Tuesday.
	   Mustafa Osman Ismail also said the United States must compensate
Sudan for cost of the plant he said used to produce more than 50
percent of his country's medicines.
	   ``We wonder why the Americans are opposing the sending of a
fact-finding mission if they are so sure of their own findings,''
Ismail said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced
chemical weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken
from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a
precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   The United States also says the plant had ties to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the bombing of
two U.S. embassies in Africa last month.
	   The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday on an
Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation into
U.S. claims that the El Shifa plant was making chemical weapons.
	   Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing
Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to
justify the bombing.
	   ``The soil is there. The remnants and rubble of the factory are
there. The fact-finding mission can easily collect samples from the
soil,'' Ismail said.
	   He said it was the duty of the Security Council to dispatch a
team to investigate the truth.
	   ``We want back our factory, which we built with our toil and
sweat, and which cost us millions of dollars,'' Ismail said. ``We
need the medicines, of which the people were deprived as a result
of the American attack.''
	   Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims
immediately after the attack, but the council shelved the matter
after initial discussions.
	   Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month
after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of
aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty
and territory, and a violation of international law.''
