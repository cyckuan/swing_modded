   WASHINGTON _ Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration on Sunday
sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the
factory to the production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that in the weeks leading up to last Thursday's
strike, the United States had obtained a sample of a critical
chemical used in the making of VX, a deadly nerve agent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has so far declined to lay out its evidence
publicly except to say there was ``physical evidence'' of the
precursor chemical at the factory, in an industrial area of the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum. The officials declined to name the
chemical, which the administration has classified, but they said it
had no other known use that would explain its presence in the
plant, called the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
</P>
<P>
   The United States struck the plant in Sudan and a paramilitary
training camp in Afghanistan on Thursday with a simultaneous
barrage of roughly 75 cruise missiles. President Clinton and his
aides have said the attack was to punish Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
exile that the United States has accused of sponsoring terrorist
attacks, including the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said they had credible evidence that bin Laden's
organization planned to carry out additional attacks against
Americans. Appearing on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, said the bombings in
Africa were just the start of a campaign orchestrated by bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 7th of August, we saw the attack against the two
embassies, and we had very reliable and convincing information that
might be only the first of two of three or even possibly four
attacks,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the evidence pointing to new attacks did not include
the location of potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials and lawmakers from both
political parties who have seen the evidence have insisted that it
is irrefutable, questions have continued to arise.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, the government has insisted that the pharmaceutical
factory was a benign commercial venture and called on the United
Nations to investigate the U.S. strike. On Sunday, government
officials took the chief U.N. representative in Sudan, Phillip
Borel, on a tour of the debris from the factory, which was heavily
damaged in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The factory was obliterated by the strike, which one U.S.
official said was designed to make the building fall in on itself,
limiting the chance of toxins escaping into the air.
</P>
<P>
   People who toured the area afterward were able to see
pharmaceutical products in the debris. Administration officials do
not dispute that the factory might have had commercial purposes.
The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Sunday that it would not be readily apparent from the debris that
production of a VX precursor had been under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that anyone visibly can identify what chemicals
might be in and around the vicinity,'' he said Sunday on CNN's
``Late Edition.'' ``There is no question in our mind that that
facility, that factory, was used to produce a chemical that is used
in the manufacture of VX nerve gas and has no other commercial
distribution as far as we understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have physical evidence of that fact,'' he added, ``and
very, very little doubt of it.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the administration has been extremely reluctant to
discuss its evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration says the precursor has no other use
than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of
chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical
weapons, said another administration official, who, like the
others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an odorless, colorless liquid. A drop on the skin can
result in death within a matter of minutes. There are different
ways to make it and dozens of chemical precursors that could be
used, many of them with other, benign uses.
</P>
<P>
   Amy E. Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms research
organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount
of precursor chemicals _ or space _ to make a weapon. But a factory
would have to have special glass-lined reactors and tubes that
would resist corrosion by highly toxic chemicals, she said. ``If
this pharmaceutical facility had corrosion-resistant equipment, it
would be possible to mask small quantities of chemical agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection between the factory and bin Laden is also
unclear. On the day of the attack, Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said bin Laden ``had some financial interest in contributing
to this particular facility.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the link
is not that direct. The plant, they said, was built by a state-run
entity called the Military Industrial Complex, and it is to that
group that bin Laden has connections, not to the factory itself.
