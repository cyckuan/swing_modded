<HEADLINE> Owner of Destroyed Plant To Sue  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Sudanese owner of a pharmaceutical plant
destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles is seeking $50 million in
compensation on the ground that his Khartoum factory was targeted
because of false charges that it had terrorist links.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Idris, who purchased the al-Shifa plant five months before
the August 1998 bombing, will file a civil action suit in the U.S.
Court of Claims in hopes of obtaining restitution.
</P>
<P>
   He has retained the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis
and Pogue, which said in a statement that Idris will establish that
al-Shifa was ''engaged only in pharmaceutical processing and
packaging,'' with no connection to international terror.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the attack, alleging that the plant
had links to Osama bin Laden, exiled Saudi-born millionaire
suspected in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The retaliatory attack against the Khartoum facility was two
weeks later, coupled with cruise missile strikes against alleged
terror camps in Afghanistan said to have been under bin Laden's
control.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has
retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made
two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, ''except for the
claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was
found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that a study commissioned by Idris found no trace of
Empta in the ground soil and drainage sludge at al-Shifa but
instead found evidence of common pesticides with ''chemical
similarity'' to Empta.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he has always opposed terrorism as a tool of
political action, has never met with bin Laden and has not
knowingly done business with him or any of his associates.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent comment on the issue, State Department
spokesman Philip Reeker said last week the administration stands by
its initial justification for the bombing. He said evidence
suggests that bin Laden was seeking to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical weapons, for use against American
targets. He said Empta, used to make chemical weapons, was found
outside the al-Shifa facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the nearly two years since the attack, the evidence about
the purpose of this chemical plant remains persuasive,'' Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he understands the need of the U.S. government to
defend itself against acts of terror. ''But a government becomes
what it fears most when it lashes out against the innocent and then
fails to recognize its errors and make full restitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudanese government backs Idris's claims that the plant was
not carrying out illicit activities and has demanded that a U.N.
fact-finding mission be established to investigate.
