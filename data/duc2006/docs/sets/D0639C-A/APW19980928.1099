Security Council discusses resolution on Sudan bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council held preliminary
discussions Monday on an Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding
a U.N. investigation into U.S. claims that a Sudanese factory it
bombed last month was making chemical weapons.
	   Council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said he had received a
letter from Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak, the current head of
the informal group of Arab states, known as the Arab Group, with a
copy of the draft resolution in it.
	   ``But the conclusion of today's discussion was that
consultations will continue among members,'' Dahlgren said.
	   The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the
grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Washington says the El Shifa plant was also linked to Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect in last
month's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. Sudan says the plant
produced medicines and veterinary drugs.
	   Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims
immediately after the Aug. 20 attack, but the council shelved the
matter after initial discussions.
	   Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month
after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of
aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty
and territory, and a violation of international law.''
	   Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing
Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to
justify the bombing.
