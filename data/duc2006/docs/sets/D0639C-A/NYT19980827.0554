   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Americans of both parties rallied around President Clinton's
decision to launch military strikes against alleged terrorist
installations in Afghanistan and Sudan. But the administration's
refusal to share more information about its choice of targets and
timing is disturbing. By its excessive secrecy, Washington only
increases skepticism about its claim that the Shifa chemical
factory in Sudan was really producing nerve gas ingredients and
thus had to be destroyed to prevent new terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it has ``compelling'' evidence, in the form
of soil samples, for its claims about the Shifa factory. But until
it shares some of that evidence, legitimate questions can be asked
about the justifications given for the Sudan attack.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the soil samples contain Empta, a
chemical not found in nature and with no known uses outside the
manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX. But Washington will not
produce the samples or detailed results of its tests on the soil.
Sudanese authorities insist that the plant was used to produce
pharmaceuticals, noting that the U.N.sanctions committee had
authorized the Shifa factory to export veterinary medicine to Iraq.
The Sudan has invited an international mission to come and collect
its own soil samples.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also had trouble sustaining its original claim of
a direct financial link between the Shifa factory and Osama bin
Laden, the alleged master terrorist Washington accuses of
organizing this month's deadly bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. The administration has repeatedly contended
that it had to strike the bases in Afghanistan quickly to head off
new terrorist actions. But it has so far been unable to show any
clear connection between the Shifa plant and any specific terrorist
plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the plant was not an immediate threat, Washington should have
explored opportunities to resolve the Shifa question by diplomacy
before resorting to cruise-missile attack. Sudan has previously
acceded to U.S. requests, for example by expelling bin Laden in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   These uncertainties make it imperative that the soil samples,
test results and other aspects of the administration's case be more
widely shared. If Washington cannot be more forthcoming, it should
take up Sudan's offer to let international investigators examine
the Shifa site. Nerve gas components like Empta are long-lasting.
If they were in the soil two months ago, they are probably still
there.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the right to use military force against
factories and training camps where terrorist attacks against U.S.
targets are being prepared. But the administration owes it to world
opinion, and the American people, to demonstrate that it has chosen
its targets carefully.  &QL;
