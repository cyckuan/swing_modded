<HEADLINE> U.S: Soil Samples Link Sudan Factory to VX Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence said
Tuesday that soil samples from the area of a Sudan pharmaceutical
factory, hit by cruise missiles last week by the U.S. force,
showed traces of an ingredient for making deadly VX gas.
</P>
<P>
"It is a substance that has no commercial applications. It
doesn't occur naturally in the environment. It's not a byproduct
of any other chemical process. The only thing you can use it for,
that we know of, is to make VX," a senior U.S. intelligence
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the chemical found in the soil samples was EMPTA, or
o-ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid.
</P>
<P>
The soil samples were taken clandestinely in the last few
months, the senior official said. He declined to say who took them
but said the United States was confident there was no tampering.
"We know where we got it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese officials, however, dismissed the remarks as lies.
</P>
<P>
"How can we believe that they have taken the soil from here?
They can take it from anywhere in the world and say that this is
the sand taken from the factory in Shifa," said Mohammed al-Hassan
al-Amin, political secretary of Sudan's National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"They still have not produced any concrete evidence," Sudan's
Information Minister Ghazi Salahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot prove it by claiming to have contaminated soil,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The El Shifa factory in Khartoum was largely destroyed in the
attack by U.S. cruise missiles with 10 people wounded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senior intelligence official also said that the
Sudanese owners of the El Shifa factory had met with Iraqis close
to Iraq's chemical weapons program. And he named one of the Iraqis
as Imad al-Ani, whom he described as a senior official with the
Iraqi company Samarra Drug Industries.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq strongly denied any contact with the Shifa factory
beyond pharmaceutical supplies approved by the U.N. Security
Council's sanctions committee, which monitors goods imported to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is part of the U.S. effort to try to muddle the
whole situation in order to cover up the problem that they have
had with the bombing of Sudan," Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon said in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said that the United Nations approved in January a
contract for the Shifa factory to manufacture a product for export
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was listed in U.N. documents as "Shifzole 2.5 percent
(Albndazole 2.5 percent for Levamisole)." One of the sources said
it was a deworming drug for animals.
</P>
<P>
Sudan made details of the contract public last week in
rejecting Washington's claim that the Shifa factory had produced
ingredients used to manufacture the deadly VX gas.
</P>
<P>
While defending its bombing of the pharmaceutical factory, the
Clinton administration nevertheless conceded that the facility
probably also manufactured medicines.
</P>
<P>
"That facility very well may have been producing
pharmaceuticals," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"But that in no way alters the fact that the factory also was
producing precursor elements" of nerve gas, he said.
