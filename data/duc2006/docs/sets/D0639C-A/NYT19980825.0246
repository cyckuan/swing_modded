NERVE GAS USED BY CULT HAD SAME CHEMICAL FOUND AT SUDAN PLANT

   BOSTON _ Virtually the same compound that was found outside a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and led to last week's US rocket
strike was also found in the blood of a man who had been killed by
VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult, a team of scientists
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting of the American Chemical Society, chemist
Anthony Tu said that the compound, called EMPTA, is ``unique for
VX,'' the deadliest nerve gas known, and has no other chemical
function. It exists only as an ingredient for the manufacture of
VX, or as a product of its breakdown after use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tu, a specialist in chemical weapons who teaches at Colorado
State University and was one of the specialists called in by
Japanese officials in the aftermath of a deadly attack by sarin
nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in 1995, said that VX had been
used by the same cult group in an attack on a 28-year-old man in
December 1994. In that attack, the deadly compound was sprayed
directly on the victim's skin. The man lost consciousness
immediately and died 10 days later, although the cause of his death
was not determined at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year later, after members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had
confessed to the subway attack and also to the separate VX attack,
that scientists analyzed a blood sample that had been taken from
the VX victim. After all that time, the distinctive EMPTA was still
clearly evident in the blood sample, said Dr. Hitoshi Tsuchihashi
of the Osaka Police Institute Forensic Science Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuchihashi said no research had been published in the
scientific literature about the metabolism of VX and its breakdown
products, so the discovery of EMPTA in the man's blood could lead
to a diagnostic test to determine if the agent was used used in any
future attacks. The victim of that 1994 attack is the only person
ever known to have died from VX poisoning, Tsuchihashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuchihashi and his colleagues have also studied the break-down
products of sarin gas and other forms of nerve gas that might be
used by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Tu said that a team of American specialists was sent to Japan
shortly after the subway attack in 1995, but Japanese officials
were not willing to share detailed information with them and the
group ``came back empty-handed.'' That's why, he said, he decided
to organize a session at this year's chemical society meeting to
share the lessons learned from that attack with American scientists
and emergency officials. All of the key forensic scientists,
biochemists and doctors who participated in the treatment of the
victims of the sarin attack had been invited to participate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 deaths were attributed to the sarin attack. Those
deaths could have been prevented, said Dr. Tetsu Okumura of the
department of acute medicine at Japan's Kawasaki Medical School, if
the information had been available for a proper medical response.
</P>
<P>
   Okumura, who was one of the doctors in the emergency room at St.
Luke's hospital in Tokyo, where many of the victims were treated,
said emergency medical personnel in his country are not allowed to
perform intubations _ a treatment to open blocked airways _ at the
scene of an emergency. Such treatment would have ensured the
survival of all the sarin victims, he said, adding that nerve gases
cause paralysis, and those who received the largest doses of sarin
were unable to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Although sarin ``victims, adequately intubated, never die,'' he
said, ``in present Japanese law, EMTs cannot save the victim. But
in the US, many paramedics can do intubation at the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The other treatment given in the sarin poisoning was a compound
called PAM, which is also used to treat some pesticide poisonings.
As a result, in Japan the compound is routinely stocked in rural
hospitals where pesticide poisonings are more common, but not in
urban hospitals. That policy needs to be re-examined in light of
recent terrorist activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sarin victims were also treated with atropine, which is
routinely stocked in hospitals, Okumura said. But even that was not
available in sufficient quantity to deal with the massive subway
attack, which affected more than 5,000 people. Only the most
severely affected patients received atropine, but many others might
have been spared long-term symptoms if the treatment had been
available.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tsuchihashi said a large-scale study is being carried out to
monitor survivors of the subway attack, to learn what long-term
effects their exposure to the gas may produce.
