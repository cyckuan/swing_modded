   WASHINGTON _ The chemical that the United States cited to
justify its bombing of a Sudanese factory last week could be used
for commercial products, the agency overseeing the treaty barring
chemical weapons said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has insisted that the chemical found outside
the plant could only mean that the plant was intended to make the
nerve agent VX. Sudan contends the plant made medicines and
veterinary products.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty group, the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, conceded that it was not aware of
any commercial product on the market that contained the chemical,
nor of another chemical compound made with it.
</P>
<P>
   But its spokesman, Donato Kinigier-Passigli, said in a telephone
interview on Wednesday that a search of scientific papers showed
the chemical, known as EMPTA, could be used ``in limited quantities
for legitimate commercial purposes.'' The uses, he said, included
fungicides and anti-microbial agents, and not just the production
of VX.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon official said that the treaty organization had
simply uncovered academic examples of possible use with no real
evidence that any commercial products are made from EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you identify a chemical agent for commercial
uses, that does not mean anyone makes it,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the chemical industry, experts said they were not aware of
any commercial uses for EMPTA, nor could they foresee any practical
uses based on what is known about the chemical. Aldrich Chemical
Co. in Milwaukee makes the chemical and sells it at $45 a gram to
laboratories for research. But a spokesman said the company was not
aware of its use in any commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration leveled the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. plant in Khartoum with a volley of cruise missiles
last Thursday, saying it had evidence linking the factory to the
manufacturing of VX and to a shadowy network of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Facing questions about the decision to bomb the factory, senior
administration officials said on Monday that a soil sample
collected nearby provided irrefutable evidence of the presence of
VX at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Kinigier-Passigli emphasized that the organization had come to
no conclusions about the administration's charges or the Sudan's
counter-charges. The independent organization administers the
chemical weapons treaty, signed by more than 160 nations and
ratified by the U.S. Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organization's disclosure raised questions about the
administration's categorical assertions that there could be no
other possible explanation for the presence of EMPTA, or ethyl
methylphosphonothionate. Wednesday's disclosure added to a number
of inconsistencies in the administration's accusations, including
statements by a senior intelligence official hours after the
bombing that the plant in Khartoum was heavily guarded and produced
no commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined on Wednesday to discuss the
evidence or the caveats raised by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. However, Defense and intelligence
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they still
believed there could be no other explanation for the presence of
EMPTA in a soil sample secretly collected outside the facility
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, several American experts in chemical warfare and
analysis offered another possible explanation. They said the
chemical's structure resembled that of an agricultural insecticide,
known as FONOFOS, which is commercially available in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While the two are not identical, they have molecular
similarities and could be confused in a laboratory test performed
under less-than-ideal conditions, said Hank Ellison, a
counterterrorism expert who ran the Army's chemical and biological
warfare programs at Fort Campbell, Ky., in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, now the president of Cerberus &AMP; Associates, Inc., a
security consulting firm in Michigan, said that while the chemical
characteristics of FONOFOS and EMPTA were not identical, they were
``very similar'' and those similarities ``could be misinterpreted
in a lab analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine this soil sample wasn't taken under the best of
circumstances, by somebody placing it in a cooler and immediately
sending it to a lab,'' he said. ``And quality control for the
storage and manufacture of pesticides and insecticides is not the
highest in the world, so that could increase the possibility of
seeing similarities in the chemical structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense and intelligence officials dismissed the possibility
that the United States could have misinterpreted the soil sample.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hague, an official with the chemical weapons
organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said scientific
research also suggested that EMPTA could be the byproduct of the
breakdown of other pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The international treaty, which the United States Senate
ratified last year despite the reservations of many conservative
Republicans, who said the organization would never be effective,
does not identify EMPTA by name.
</P>
<P>
   But the treaty covers it under the ``Schedule 2'' list of
chemicals that are subject to scrutiny by the organization's
inspectors. By definition, chemicals included on Schedule 2 can
have legitimate commercial purposes. That is unlike chemicals on
Schedule 1, which are deemed to have no other use than to kill
people and are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is the
international agency whose more than 400 enginers and diplomats
oversee the inspections of governments and chemical companies
around the world to assure they are not making prohibited agents.
The group searched known scientific literature in respone to press
inquiries on EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has not signed the treaty, so factories like Shifa
Pharmaceuticals are not subject to its inspectors, unlike companies
in the United States and other nations that have approved the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization did not identify any products using
EMPTA, officials said they could not rule out the possibility as
strongly as the administration has.
</P>
<P>
   The official at the organization, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the scientific research showed companies including
the Mobil Corp. and International Chemical Industries of America
had conducted research into commercial applications that used
EMPTA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan has called for an international investigation of the
missile strike, which killed one person and wounded seven others,
according to the government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carnaffin, a British engineer who worked as a technical
manager during the factory's construction from 1992 to 1996, said
he never saw any evidence of EMPTA or other materials involved in
the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I went into every corner of the plant,'' he said in
a telephone interview from his home in England. ``It was never a
plant of high security. You could walk around anywhere you liked,
and no one tried to stop you.''
