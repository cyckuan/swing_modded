Arab group asks for U.N. investigation of U.S. bombing in Sudan

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 22 Arab states at the United Nations
have again asked the Security Council to approve a U.N.
investigation of the U.S. attack on a factory in Sudan, according
to a document released Wednesday.
	   The United States destroyed the Khartoum factory in August after
bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa, saying the plant made
chemical arms and had links to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
Sudan insisted the plant made only pharmaceuticals.
	   The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the president
of the Security Council requesting Secretary-General Kofi Annan
dispatch a mission ``to verify all facts concerning the Al-Shifa
factory, including its production and ownership.''
	   The resolution asks Annan to submit a report on the mission's
findings within one month of the resolution's adoption.
	   Sudan requested a U.N. investigation immediately after the
attack and demanded compensation from the United States for the
cost of the plant, which it said was used to produce more than 50
percent of the country's medicines.
	   The Arab Group also asked for an investigation, but the council
shelved both requests.
	   The United States says a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed that the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the
grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has
imposed trade and other economic sanctions.
	   The United States has accused bin Laden of being the architect
of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which
killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States bombed the Khartoum factory and a
site in Afghanistan that Washington said was a terrorist camp
funded by bin Laden.
