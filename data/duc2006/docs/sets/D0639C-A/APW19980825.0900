Iraq strongly denies weapons connection to Sudanese factory

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq strongly denies U.S. intelligence
charges that it worked with Sudanese scientists at a Khartoum plant
to build chemical weapons projects, the Iraqi ambassador said
Tuesday.
	   Iraq's only contact with the pharmacy was to fill pharmaceutical
contracts, Nizar Hamdoon told reporters. The U.S. charges are
``part of the effort to try to muddle the whole situation in order
to cover up the problem that they've had with the bombing of the
Sudan,'' Hamdoon said.
	   U.S. intelligence officials linked the plant to Iraqi scientists
on Monday as part of an effort to back its justification for
bombing the factory last Thursday. The officials said they had
intercepted phone conversations between scientists at the plant and
some of the top officials in Iraq's chemical weapons program.
	   Soil sample from the plant site showed traces of EMPTA, a
manmade chemical that has no commercial uses and is a key
ingredient in the deadly nerve agent VX, U.S. intelligence
officials said.
	   Iraq, which has been subject to U.N. inspections of its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs since the end of
the Gulf war, has acknowledged that it produced VX but couldn't use
it as a weapon.
	   The United States has come under pressure to justify its strike
following Sudan's claims that the El Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co., plant produced only medicinal drugs and vaccines.
	   In a letter Tuesday to the Security Council, Sudan's U.N.
ambassador, Elfatih Erwa said the plant supplied Sudan with 90
percent of its medicine for treating animals.
	   The factory also produced anti-malarials, and drugs to treat
ulcers, diabetes, rheumatism and hypertension. It is the only
factory in Sudan which produces the drug to treat pulmonary
tuberculosisis, Erwa said.
	   He gave a list of recent visits to the plant by dignitaries,
including the current German and former British ambassadors to
Sudan, and Hussein El-Bazazi, the eastern Mediterranean regional
director for the U.N. World Health Organization.
	   The United Nations approved a dlrs 199,000 contract last January
for the plant to ship Iraq 100,000 litres of Shifazole, which
controls parasitic diseases in horses and cows, as part of the U.N.
program that lets Iraq sell its oil to buy food and medicine.
	   The contract was renewed July 7 because the plant hadn't
delivered the goods within the six-month timeframe stipulated in
the original contract. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said such an
extension is not unusual in contracts for the oil-for-food program.
	   ``In that context we have had commercial ties but nothing beyond
that and we strongly deny there has been any chemical connections
regarding that,'' Hamdoon said.
	   He said Iraq hoped the Security Council would agree to Sudan's
request that an independent technical team visit the site to
determine whether the U.S. claims were true.
	   On Monday, the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said no
such investigation was needed because the United States already had
compelling evidence.
