Judge OKs Chemical Arms Destruction

   WASHINGON (AP) -- A federal judge has cleared the way for
continued destruction of chemical weapons at a government
incinerator in Utah, concluding there is no risk to human health or
the environment, the Justice Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the weapons, including nerve gas, has been
the focus of controversy for years with critics charging lax safety
procedures at the U.S. Army's Tooele chemical weapons disposal
facility. They also argued that the burning releases harmful levels
of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell, in a ruling issued in
Salt Lake City, said that the incineration of the weapons and
chemical agents at the Tooele facility presents no imminent or
substantial danger to human health or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The government under a 1985 law must destroy more nearly 4
million munitions and bulk containers holding 30,000 tons of deadly
chemical agents -- including nerve gas, mustard gas and VX gas --
once part of the military arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   So far it has burned about 20 percent of the material in the
special incinerators at Tooele and on the Johnston Island in the
Pacific. In all, eight incinerators, including the Tooele facility,
are to be used for the weapons destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's decision ''assures that the Army can complete the
destruction of these dangerous weapons in an environmentally safe
manner,'' said Lois J. Schiffer, assistant attorney general for
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, including the Chemical Weapons Working Group and
the Sierra Club, had filed a lawsuit asking the court to stop the
Army from operating the Tooele incinerator, arguing the facility
did not meet safety requirements and violated a number of
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell rejected the claim and said the citizen and
environmental groups did not prove that any violations had occurred
or were likely to occur at the Tooele facility near Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The plants at Tooele and Johnston Island have been the only
incinerators in operation under the Army program. The pilot project
on Johnston Island recently was concluded after more than 1,800
tons of chemical agent and about 380,000 tons of munitions and
containers were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 tons of chemical agents have been burned at Tooele,
about 30 percent of the total, so far. In all nearly 439,000
munitions and containers also have been burned, or about 38 percent
of the total at Tooele.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also rejected legal challenges by the same groups in
1996 and again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tooele, the Army also is building or plans to
build incinerators for burning chemical munitions and chemical
agents at seven locations in Oregon, Colorado, Arkansas, Illinois,
Alabama, Tennessee and Maryland.
