U.S. SAYS IRAQ AIDED PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SUDAN

   WASHINGTON _ The United States believed that senior Iraqi
scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX
at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed
last week, administration and intelligence officials said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence the administration has cited as justification for
the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago
outside the pharmaceutical factory, the Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries, the officials said. Officially the administration has
refused to describe its evidence in any detail, or to say how it
was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The sample contained a rare chemical that would require two more
complex steps to be turned into VX, one of the deadliest nerve
agents in existence, and the chemical, whose acronym is EMPTA, has
no industrial uses. The United Nations and the United States have
long agreed that Iraq is extremely skilled at many kinds of VX
production, having worked for years to perfect the best process.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
there was evidence that senior Iraqi scientists had aided the
efforts to make VX at that factory, and at another plant a couple
of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The connection with Iraq emerged as a key part of the
administration's argument for why it was justified in launching
cruise missiles at a plant in another country without any warning.
</P>
<P>
   The officials disclosed the information, four days after the
American strike, to try to counter claims by the Sudanese
government that the factory, located in an industrial area of
Khartoum, was purely a benign commercial venture that produced half
of the Sudan's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, rebuffed calls from the Sudan and
other countries to turn over its evidence. At the United Nations,
the Security Council on Monday put off a request by Arab nations _
submitted by one of the United States' closest Arab allies, Kuwait
_ to send inspectors to search the rubble in Khartoum for signs of
chemicals related to VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what the purpose of a fact-finding study would
be,'' Peter Burleigh, the deputy American representative to the
United Nations, said after the meeting. ``We have credible
information that fully justifies the strike we made on that one
facility in Khartoum.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Khartoum, the Sudanese president, Omar
Hassan el-Bashir, kept up his sharp attacks on the United States
and President Clinton, saying Clinton ordered the attack to cover
up the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his senior aides have described the evidence linking
the factory to the production of VX as compelling and even
irrefutable, though until Monday the administration refused to
discuss the evidence in any but the most general way.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the soil
sample, collected outside the factory, contained traces of a
``precursor chemical`` called ethyl methylphosphonothionate, or
EMPTA. There would be no viable explanation for the presence of
that chemical, they said, other than the production of VX.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't obtain this chemical because you're making ball
point pens or whatever,'' an administration official said. ``If
you're making this, you're making VX.''
</P>
<P>
   VX is an odorless, colorless liquid that can kill with
remarkable speed. A mere drop on the skin or inhaled in the lungs
is enough to kill an adult within minutes. There are a number of
ways to make the agent, but the officials in Washington and other
American and foreign officials said the technique using EMPTA is
one Iraq used to develop its own VX stockpiles in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and at the United Nations said there
were a number of other factors linking Iraq to the pharmaceutical
plant, as well as a second facility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, President Saddam Hussein's government asked
the committee that monitors U.N. sanctions to allow it to buy
medicines from the factory under the ``oil for food'' program that
allows humanitarian supplies into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative to the United
Nations who is this month's president of the sanctions committee,
confirmed the request, but the officials said it was not clear what
medicines were ordered or whether any were ever delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations closely monitors goods purchased
under the ``oil for food'' program, the officials said the contract
could have provided a pretext for extensive visits by Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official said that one of the leaders of
Iraq's chemical weapons program, Emad al-Ani, had close ties with
senior Sudanese officials at the factory. The official said a
number of Iraqi scientists working for Emad al-Ani had attended the
grand opening of the factory two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials
in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected
of making chemical weapons. That site, according to diplomats in
New York and the Sudan, has been frequently visited by Iraqi
technicians and was more heavily guarded than Shifa Pharmaceutical.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also in a residential neighborhood, and officials
familiar with planning for the American cruise missile strikes said
the fear of collateral damage was a factor in choosing a target. A
strike at a plant that made VX itself, not merely a precursor to
it, would pose significant risks of scattering a deadly nerve agent
during an attack.
