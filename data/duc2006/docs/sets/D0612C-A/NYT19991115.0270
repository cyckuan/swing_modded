FAMILY HIT TWICE BY DISEASE

<P>
   On the outside, the Brestler house looks like any number of
gracious Eastside homes for a growing family with three children.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, it's a little different. But it's not obvious at
first.
</P>
<P>
   There are invisible alarms on all the doors here, to keep
children from wandering away. And what looks like a well-appointed
playroom is really a fully equipped behavioral therapy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Brestlers have three boys. The two youngest have autism.
</P>
<P>
   Max, 8, and Kevin, 6, look like typical children. Inside, they
are a little different. And it isn't always obvious at first.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, have ``invisible alarms'' locking away parts of their
brains. The brain disorder interferes with their ability to develop
language and form relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few years ago, the fact the Brestlers have two boys with
the disease would have seemed an almost unfathomable coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, researchers believe there is a strong genetic component
to autism, which is three to four times more common in boys than
girls.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are about 1-in-20 that a family with one child with
autism will have another. That's 50 to 100 times the rate expected
in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates a high genetic component to autism, said
Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the
autism project at the University of Washington. ``We believe at
least five genes are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In studies of identical twins in which one twin has autism, the
chance of the other twin being affected is about 70 percent. In
fraternal twins _ those who do not share identical genetic status _
the chances that the second twin will also be autistic is about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Max was first diagnosed at age 2{, Linda Brestler had no
idea she would soon face a second loss.
</P>
<P>
   But she was already worried about Kevin, still under a year, who
at 10 months had such low muscle tone he could not hold his head up
and was not crawling.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers reading the book ``Let Me Hear Your Voice,'' a
book by a mother of two autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the section where her second son was diagnosed,
I threw the book across the room,'' she said. ``It was
mind-boggling, the thought I could possibly have two. I remember
rocking Kevin, saying, `Please, God, don't take him away from me,
too.'''
</P>
<P>
   But rearing Max and Kevin has given her a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People lose the idea they're just kids,'' Brestler said. ``You
forget, they're regular kids before they're autistic.''
</P>
<P>
   And like regular kids, Max and Kevin are as different from each
other as any two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Dark-haired Max doesn't speak. He struggles to move his tongue
to form sounds. The shapes of words elude him. About one-third of
children with autism remain mute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you hungry, Max?'' his mother asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh.'' Soft, plaintive. Max's way of saying yes. Even though
he doesn't talk, his receptive language _ ability to understand _
is near normal.
</P>
<P>
   Max has a shy smile, a tentative walk. He doesn't like long
hair, or the feel of grass under his feet. ``He has a thing about
textures,'' says Bridgette Tuttle, one of his therapists. He is
afraid of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Max was about 18 months old when his parents first noticed he
was losing eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was withdrawing, and we started questioning his hearing
because he wasn't responding to his name,'' Brestler said. The word
autism never entered her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told her to watch and wait. The more she waited, the
more nervous she got. Eventually, she looked autism up in a medical
dictionary. ``It was a three-line definition,'' she said.
``Everything fit Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year of life, they're developing seemingly
normally,'' she said. ``Then that second year, you just lose them;
it's quite devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Max is taking a break from his daily regimen of
behavioral therapy. He sits in a small rocker, fading in and out.
Occasionally, his hands dart together in quick claps. He has an
obsession with rectangles, especially videotape boxes. He likes to
hold them, turning them slowly in his hands, or incessantly
rearranging them.
</P>
<P>
   Brestler redirects him every few minutes with a question. The
questions get him out of his ``self-stimming,'' the slang parents
of autistic children use to describe the range of baffling,
repetitive behaviors that steal their children's attention away
from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, in contrast, is the lively, social one. On this day, he
hurtles across the family room into his mother's lap. The room is
strewn with soft-cover books, their bindings curled. He doesn't
read them. They are a ``self-stimming'' object, like his brother's
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brother, Kevin was a social baby who made good eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``But motorwise (as a baby), he was starting to have problems,''
Brestler said. ``He presented very differently (than Max.)''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kevin is verbal, although he mainly talks to himself. He
responds to simple commands and questions, but can't engage in
conversation. He doesn't understand as much language as Max.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest things about having two children with autism
is the misconceptions people have about the disorder, Brestler
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true, for example, that children with autism aren't
affectionate, or can't learn, or are completely out of touch with
reality, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen otherwise. It has taken 20 hours a week of therapy
for nearly six years, but Max finally has grasped the intent of
language, and communicates by pointing in a book of photographs to
his favorite foods and activities.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked his way up to about 10 sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Aah uuh ooh,''' she said. ``It means `I love you.'''
