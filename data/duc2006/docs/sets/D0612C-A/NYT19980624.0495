BILL PROPOSED FOR AUTISM RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Many parents of autistic children haven't been
happy with Sen. Slade Gorton since he proposed making it easier for
teachers to suspend from school unruly disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, R-Wash., isn't backing off his position that
schoolteachers need more disciplinary tools to restore order in the
classroom, but Wednesday he took another step that drew praise from
families of autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by ``ER'' star Anthony Edwards and former Seattle
Mariners pitcher Bill Krueger, Gorton and Rep. James Greenwood,
R-Penn., said they would introduce legislation to focus more money
and attention on autism research, much of which is conducted at the
University of Washington. The bill would set up five centers for
autism research around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those supporting the bill have been touched by autism in
some way. Gorton Wednesday for the first time mentioned publicly
that he has an autistic grandson; Edwards has an autistic nephew,
Krueger an autistic daughter, and Greenwood worked with autistic
children as a social worker before he was elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Infantile autism is a severe neurological disorder appearing in
childhood that is characterized by an inability to relate to
others, highly repetitive play, and language impairment. Autism is
the third most common developmental disorder among children. An
estimated 400,000 people in this country suffer from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton called autism ``one of the most common disabling
conditions with which children are afflicted, but one that the
physicians and the scientists and the researchers tell us can in
fact be cured, and is not something that we simply must accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant amount of fine research has already been
accomplished, much of it at the University of Washington, and what
we would like to do is expand that research across the country, see
to it that the researchers are able to work together and share
their results, and to try to see that they have sufficient amounts
of money and facilities with which to conduct it,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The University's Center on Human Development and Disability,
funded in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development, is conducting research aimed at early detection of
autism and at understanding the role of genetic factors in autism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the autism research centers, the bill would
create a greater role for parents in the National Institutes of
Health funding decisions, a gene and tissue bank of autism
materials, and a national autism awareness program. The bill, which
sets aside $40 million for autism research over the next year, was
pushed by an organization called Cure Autism Now, which was started
by Jonathan Shestack, the producer of ``Air Force One,'' and his
wife, Portia Iversen.
