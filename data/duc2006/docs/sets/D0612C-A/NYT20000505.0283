   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ One family came from India, others from
Greece, Italy and Israel. An Australian family is thinking about
coming. By comparison, Rob and Anne Mandel had it pretty easy,
giving up his medical practice and a life they loved in Indiana to
get their son, Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is autistic, and his parents' move here made the Mandels
part of a phenomenon: families that, desperate for the most
sophisticated special education services for their disabled
children, have moved from other states and even other nations in
search of care.
</P>
<P>
   But, increasingly, the needs of parents with autistic children
are clashing with the bottom lines of school districts that have to
pay for enormously expensive services _ often more than $40,000 per
child per year _ for students who may never set foot in district
classrooms, but will be sent to private institutions at a school
district's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts are sympathetic to the needs of families,
increasingly armed with sophisticated knowledge about programs and
treatments, who uproot themselves to get their children the best
care. But many districts, particularly in states like New Jersey
with programs that are magnets for families around the country and
the world, say schools are bearing too much of the cost with too
little control over which children get what care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving the suburban school districts crazy,'' said James
H. Lytle, the superintendent of Trenton's public schools. ``If you
have eight kids who need to go to a special school, you have to go
to your taxpayers for $400,000. That's essentially like sending
them all to Andover.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lytle added, ``I hate the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1975 federal law, guarantees a ``free and appropriate public
education'' for all disabled students. But the education available
in most places cannot compare with what is offered in states like
New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which have the most
sophisticated private programs for treating autism. So families,
many of whom share information on the Internet, are increasingly
relocating to areas with the best programs.
</P>
<P>
   Total school enrollment in New Jersey grew by 11.8 percent from
1991 to 1997, the most recent year for which comparable figures are
available. The number of disabled students increased by 14 percent.
The number of autistic children registered in New Jersey increased
sevenfold, from 234 to 1,634.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the increase may be due to better diagnostic methods or
the inclusion of children with behaviors that resemble autism. But
migration obviously plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent of a child that has been diagnosed with
something like autism, you are not going to wait,'' said Gary S.
Mayerson, a New York lawyer who specializes in representing
families battling school districts over care for disabled children.
``You are going to look at your beautiful house and realize that it
is a noose around your neck. So people are moving all over the
country to get to states that are most responsive to their child's
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment most in demand for autism is a method known as
applied behavioral analysis, a form of highly structured and very
expensive one-on-one coaching by trained teachers. While other
treatments try to help youngsters cope with their disabilities,
applied behavioral analysis, administered at an early age, offers
children the possibility of eventually being able to attend regular
classes, its advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   So parents flock to the Princeton Child Development Institute,
where Sam Mandel and 34 other students are enrolled, or the Eden
Institute, in West Windsor, N.J., or to the Martin C. Barell
School, in Levittown, N.Y. And they go to the Connecticut Child
Development Center in Milford, where a couple from India showed up
with their child earlier this month, hoping in vain to gain
enrollment even though the school was full, said Suzanne Letso, the
school's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a doctor _ I sent people to have sophisticated tests all
the time in Indiana,'' Dr. Mandel, an anesthesiologist, said. For
that reason, he said, ``I thought there was no reason to be closer
to New York City to get these sophisticated services for Sam. But
you know what? There's nothing back there like what we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   For $46,024.20 per year, the Princeton institute provides 10
months of intensive training to help autistic children discover a
sense of the rewards of learning that they are born without.
Although they may be capable of brilliant feats of intellect _
think of Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Rain Man'' _ autistic
children totally lack both curiosity about the world and the
instinct to learn by imitating other children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Krantz, director of the Princeton institute, said that
half the children who came to her school early enough were sent to
regular classrooms within five years. If people object to paying
something like $200,000 to achieve such a goal, she said, they
should think of the alternative: a lifetime of
institutionalization, ``not to mention the human cost.''

   Sam Mandel is making spectacular progress, his parents say. But
for every winner like him, the huge expense of special education
programs and the scarcity of places at the most sought-after
schools also create losers. Only a comparative handful of autistic
children gain admission to the best private programs, and they tend
to be the children of parents with the education and money and
careers that permit them to move from state to state and from
country to country to seek out those programs.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer in India, for example, researched his child's
disability over the Internet and pinpointed Lawrence Township,
N.J., as a good place for treatment, said Terry Rosenfeld,
Lawrence's director of special education. Then he found a job at
Bell Laboratories in Hopewell, secured the necessary work papers to
allow him to immigrate, and moved his family to Lawrence. Rosenfeld
said eight severely handicapped children who had moved to the
district to receive treatment were now enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have parents moving in just for these
services,'' said Susan DiDonato, director of special services for
West Windsor-Plainsboro public schools. ``Sometimes they call ahead
and ask us what we have available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the migration and the legal requirements for ``appropriate''
education raise issues of cost and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents' definition of appropriate and the district's
definition of appropriate are often very different,'' said
Rosenfeld. If the disagreement leads to litigation, ``when you go
to court, the courts often look at what parents are saying before
they listen to us,'' he added. ``And that is why, to me, I think
the system is totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rosenfeld suggested, local schools want control over the
assignment of students and their education plans, and generally
favor local or county-based programs, typically at a local
community college. Parents complain that the local programs, while
cheaper, do not offer enough hours of training per week, let alone
the special benefits like home visits that places like the
Princeton institute offer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law requires the federal government to to pay 40
percent of a the cost of services provided under the education act.
But the government has never paid his district more than 8 percent,
Rosenfeld said. The state, meanwhile, reimburses school districts
on a sliding scale, depending on the severity of the disability,
but never more than $11,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators, in defense of the special-care migrants, say
that parents who relocate should be applauded for placing
confidence in their new homes' school systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we should be proud that we are so successful,''
said Barbara Gantwerk, director of the Office of Special Education
Programs at the New Jersey Department of Education. Indeed,
advocates for the children say, the biggest problem is not what it
costs to educate such children at the best treatment centers, but
that not enough children get that care.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenfeld, at Lawrence public schools, said he was deeply
discouraged over the drain that expensive treatments for a few
children were imposing on other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents will do absolutely anything for their children,
and it's wonderful that these kids have such great advocates,''
Rosenfeld said. ``But it costs a lot of money, and that money has
to come from other programs.''
</P>
<P>
   And for families, everything is secondary to getting results for
their children. So when Tim and Leslie Quinn of Charlotte, N.C.,
realized their son Ryan, now 4, showed signs of autism, Tim Quinn
transferred to his company's headquarters in Hackettstown, N.J. The
Quinns sold their dream house in Charlotte, took their two teen-age
daughters out of high school and moved to Belle Meade, in the
Hillsborough school district, to enroll Ryan in the Princeton
school.
</P>
<P>
   They have no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan has shocked us all,'' Quinn said. ``Up until September he
was not speaking and he was not doing a lot of things, and it was
very discouraging. But then he started speaking, and he's doing
very well.''
