   ATLANTA _ Aside from Hollywood's sometimes inaccurate portrayal
of autism, few people know much about the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society
of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our
Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the
incidence of autism. The conference continues through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to bring in 1,000 attendees, and, hopefully, people
will have a better understanding about autism at the end of the
conference,'' said Vernell Henry, director of conferences for the
society.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and people whose family members are affected by autism
are the target group of the conference, which is organized around
five areas: communications; education; family and community;
medicine and research; and options for adulthood and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Autism was previously thought to affect one in 500 people, but
the number is actually closer to one in 250, according to a study
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some frequently asked questions about the disorder,
with answers by the Autism Society of America:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Autism is a complex developmental disease that is four times
more prevalent in boys than girls. It affects the normal
development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and
communication skills. No one knows what the cause of autism is. It
knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Adults and children living with autism usually have difficulty
with verbal and nonverbal communication, and leisure or play
activities. In some cases, aggressive and self-injurious behavior
may be present. They may exhibit repeated body movements, such as
hand flapping and rocking, unusual responses to people or
attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routine. Some
people with autism may also have other disorders that affect
functioning of the brain such as epilepsy, mental retardation and
Down syndrome. They may also have genetic disorders such as
Tourette's syndrome or Williams syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological
differences in the brain, but no specific cause. Autism is not a
mental illness. It is not caused by bad parenting, and children
with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the treatments?
</P>
<P>
   A: Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to
highly structured, specialized education programs tailored to their
needs. Early intervention leads to better results.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to diagnose autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no medical tests. Accurate diagnoses should be
based on observation of an individual's communication, behavior and
developmental levels. Signs of autism typically appear during the
first three years of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should parents shelter their children once it is determined
they have autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It is very important that children be kept close to other
developing children,'' said Gail McGee, director of the autism
center at Emory University. Parents should push for children's
inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and
development in that area, she said.
