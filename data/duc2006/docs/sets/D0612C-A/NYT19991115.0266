SUCCESSFUL THERAPY IN DEMAND

<P>
   The explosion in the population of children with autism has
created huge demand for therapists who can provide ``Applied
Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA), the only widely accepted treatment for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   ABA is an intensive, one-on-one form of therapy that helps
``rewire'' the brains of children with autism through repetitive
teaching and positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists with training in ABA are in such demand they've
started guarding their phone numbers to avoid disappointing parents
who stand no chance of getting their services.
</P>
<P>
   And special education preschool programs that offer even limited
ABA services are having to put students on a waiting list for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations such as these are driving a grass-roots
organization effort by parents, who are trying to improve services
and options for children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   They are also forcing parents to do battle with insurance
companies, school districts and state agencies to try to get
services to help their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 percent of parents in the (autism) clinic are engaged
in some type of legal or adversarial interaction over their
children's educational placement,'' said Dr. Alan Unis,
psychiatrist and autism expert at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as bad as the civil rights movement in the 1960s. If
these children don't get an appropriate education, the risk of them
spending the rest of their lives in institutional placements is
much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ABA is widely recognized as the treatment with the most
scientific credibility for helping children with autism, said
Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the
autism project at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the prognosis for children with autism wasn't
good, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a child is identified by age 2 or 3 and given
high-quality, intensive early intervention _ at least 25 hours of
one-on-one therapy a week for two to three years _ about 50 percent
respond really well, she said. ``They have an average IQ point
increase of 28 points,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to move a child from the mildly retarded to normal
intelligence range.
</P>
<P>
   But such interventions are costly and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our concerns is the research seems to point to certain
minimum number of hours (of treatment to be successful,)'' said
Nellie Allnutt, social services coordinator of the Developmental
Disabilities Division, King County. ``We're very concerned we won't
be able to meet what's defined as best practice for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Current funding through state and federal developmental
disability resources allows only for a few hours a week for those
children who qualify, she said. Most insurance plans don't cover
ABA.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents want more, and they are afraid if they wait to get
it, they will miss the window when their children's brains can
still be reprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Newsome is one who didn't want to wait. Newsome's younger
son Elliot, 3, was diagnosed with ``Pervasive Developmental
Delay,'' one of the disorders on the autism spectrum, about eight
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 18 months, he wasn't doing the things we thought he
should be, like pointing to stuff,'' Newsome said. ``I'd say,
`Point to your eyes, point to your nose,' and he wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Newsome tried not to compare his progress with his
older brother's, figuring all siblings are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in your heart, you know it's not just a second-kid
thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome was one of the lucky ones. She was able to find a
therapist to begin doing behavioral therapy with Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABA approach has been incredible,'' she said. ``It's like
a huge light bulb going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was like he didn't even know what we were saying.
He gets it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Children with autism lack the necessary neural connections to
learn automatically, but those connections can be established
through repetition and reinforcement, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   The technique takes advantage of the fact that the brain's
circuitry is still under construction in the early years of life.
Children born with a cloudy cataract in one eye, for example, will
develop normal vision if the cataract is removed before age 3. If
it's removed after age 3, they will remain blind in that eye
because the neural pathways that process visual information in the
brain were never stimulated. Like muscle cells that get stronger in
response to exercise, brain cells respond and adapt to stimulation
from the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, a former Microsoft manager, is working now to help
other parents get access to behavioral therapy. Together with
several other Microsoft parents (who also have children with
autism) and professionals, she has helped form Northwest Behavioral
Associates, a non-profit program to provide educational and
behavioral support services to children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which provides therapy and school-consultation
services, is also putting together a tutor-training program to
increase the pool of people qualified to work with children with
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The group joins other established parent organizations, such as
FEAT (Families for Effective Autism Treatment), which are also
working to increase training, awareness and funding for autism
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions are responding to increased demand for
services from parents as well. Children's Hospital, for example, is
developing a new autism program in collaboration with the UW's
Center on Human Development and Disability, to provide
comprehensive services for children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which will be directed by Dawson, will certify and
train therapists. It also will provide ABA therapy, as well as
other services, including school interventions, for children with
autism.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists themselves are organizing. The Northwest Association
for Behavioral Analysis has formed a committee to try to bring a
national certification test to Washington. So far, five states,
including Florida and California, have certification standards for
behavioral therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to discriminate between the qualified and the
unqualified,'' said Michael Fabrizio, a trained behavioral
therapist in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Certification is critical for increasing insurance coverage.
Currently, many parents can't get insurance to pay for therapy
because behavioral intervention doesn't fit into conventional
categories of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a medical model where you go in and get a shot,'' he
said. ``And it's not a typical therapy model, like speech therapy,
where you get an hour a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies blanch at the thought of paying for 20 to 40
hours a week of therapy, at an average cost of $30,000 a year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for people with autism are glad to see the increased
focus on intervention in a population that can't speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their poor ability to communicate, (children with
autism) tend to be misunderstood and pushed aside,'' said Audrey
Horne, president of the Autism Society of America. ``But they are
treatable and educable.''
