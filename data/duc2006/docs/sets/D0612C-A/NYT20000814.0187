   Support services for people with autism _ children and adults
alike _ fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased
behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside
their family homes, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   People with autism, a disorder that affects brain development,
tend to have trouble communicating and relating to the outside
world. More than a half-million Americans have autism or some form
of pervasive developmental disorder, says the Autism Society of
America.
</P>
<P>
   More cases of autism are being diagnosed than ever before, in
part because of changes in diagnostic criteria, says study
co-author Marsha Seltzer, a professor of social work at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service system is experiencing a crunch. In some states,
families have to have to wait several years or longer to get the
services they need,'' Seltzer says.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people think of autism as a childhood disease, she
says it's really a lifelong struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents just shoulder a tremendous responsibility,'' Seltzer
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right
around the time of diagnosis,'' she says. After that, she says,
``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never
leaves the sphere of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families surveyed by Seltzer and her colleagues think their
autistic children lack essential services. Her on-going long-term
study involves approximately 400 Wisconsin families who have either
an adolescent or adult child with autism. Roughly 40 percent of the
autistic participants are aged 20 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   David Holmes, who chairs the Autism Society of America's panel
of professional advisors, echoes the sentiments of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexities of autism require more specialized adult
services,'' Holmes says.
</P>
<P>
   Autistic people need specialized services, experts say, because
the disease is multifaceted, with wide-ranging symptoms, and
because autistic people often have a secondary condition.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the autistic subjects, for instance,
also have mental retardation, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a
seizure disorder, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Without special help, especially for autistic adults living away
from their parents, behavioral and social problems develop, say the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Because autistic people need a stimuli-controlled environment,
as well as fairly constant training in communications, behavior
management and task completion, Holmes says generic programs don't
work _ and even can harm those with autism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adult services for other forms of developmental disabilities
are not often appropriate for adults with autism,'' Homes says.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``Adults with autism can continue to develop new
skills if only given the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer and her colleagues presented their early findings last
week at a meeting of the International Association for the
Scientific Study of Disability in Seattle. Funded by the National
Institute on Aging, the study is a joint effort by researchers at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Brandeis University, in
Waltham, Mass.
