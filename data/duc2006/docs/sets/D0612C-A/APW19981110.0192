Scientists find sex hormones shape the developing and adult brain

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sex hormones can influence brain development
in the young, memory in the old and may explain why young men tend
to develop neurological problems like autism and dyslexia while
older women suffer from depression and anxiety, scientists say.
	   ``We are recognizing with some surprise the extent to which the
brain responds'' to sex steroids, said Douglas Meinecke of the
National Institute of Mental Health in Washington. ``These hormones
_ testosterone, progesterone and estrogen _ have profound effects
on the brain and the brain is profoundly responsive.''
	   Meinecke discussed the role of sex hormones in development and
aging Monday at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting.
	   Researchers hope the hormones can be used to fend off the
ravages of aging and disease. Already, estrogen replacement therapy
has been observed to protect older women against Alzheimer's
disease.
	   Nancy Forger, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts,
said she's found that sex hormones can prevent cell death.
	   Men have more motor neurons in their spinal cords that govern
muscles attached to the penis, she found. The neurons are found
both in men and women before birth; however, in the absence of male
hormones, the neurons degenerate in females.
	   Ms. Forger is trying to learn how male hormones save these cells
and understand the role of proteins that regulate growth and
survival of neurons.
	   Margaret McCarthy, a physiologist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, suggested that early exposure to male hormones
can create permanent brain changes.
	   Testosterone levels in rats are as high in development as
they're going to be in adulthood, she said. Giving a female rat
testosterone creates ``a male brain never to be switched back.''
	   Similarly, if testosterone-producing organs are removed from the
male rat, he ends up with a ``female brain,'' she said.
	   Only male reproductive organs produce sex hormones during
development, she said. Female sex organs, which produce estrogen,
are inactive until later.
	   ``As far as we know, it is also true for humans,'' Ms. McCarthy
said.
	   Asked about male and female brain differences, she noted that
boys suffer from more neurological disorders than girls. They're
more likely to have schizophrenia, autism and dyslexia, while girls
are more likely to suffer neurological illnesses later in life such
as major depression, anxiety disorders, panic disorders or eating
disorders.
	   ``This hormonal difference early in life may set up a situation
that more easily goes awry and explains why boys are more
susceptible at an early age,'' she said.
	   John Morrison, a neurobiology professor at Mount Sinai Medical
School in New York, said his studies of estrogen's effects on a
brain region called the hippocampus may shed light on aging.
	   He has that found the number of receptors on hippocampal cells
fluctuates, depending on how much estrogen is present.
	   ``The hippocampus mediates memory and loss of memory is one of
the key events to aging,'' he said.
