<P>
   The only thing more puzzling than autism itself is why it
appears to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Grasping at clues, researchers and parents have come up with a
variety of theories _ many of them at odds with one another. But so
far, the answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation is that there are multiple causes,
and that some interaction between genetic and environmental factors
causes brain development to go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed triggers range from milk or wheat allergies to viruses
or environmental toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Many children with autism, for example, have digestive problems,
including food allergies, a phenomenon that has given rise to the
``rogue peptide'' theory. The idea is that children who have
trouble digesting wheat gluten or cow's milk create peptides that
mimic natural hormones or neurotransmitters. When these rogue
peptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal
development.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories postulate that autism develops after something
triggers an autoimmune response in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children
who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had
higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly
to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the
protective sheath around nerve fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The viral connection has been fueled by anecdotal evidence from
parents whose children first showed autistic symptoms after being
immunized with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is usually
given between 12 and 15 months. So far, however, no scientific
studies have been able to link vaccines and autism.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report in the British medical journal
Lancet, for example, the incidence of autism in the United Kingdom
has been increasing since 1979. The MMR vaccine was introduced in
1988, but there was no sharp increase in cases of autism after
that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the average age of onset of autism is the same for
children whether they have been vaccinated or not, further
weakening a proposed link between the vaccine and the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But parents are still worried, and researchers acknowledge the
question needs further study.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate surrounding viruses continues, there is some
definitive evidence that outside agents can cause autism.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is known that babies whose mothers took the
anti-nausea drug thalidomide at 28 days' gestation have a much
higher incidence of autism.
</P>
<P>
   Autism also has been associated with children born to mothers
who were given drugs to control their epilepsy, said Dr. Alan Unis,
associate professor of psychiatry at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples suggest the development of autism is foreshadowed
in the earliest stages of embryonic brain development.
</P>
<P>
   There may be many more unknown agents that could cause such
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example,
have been investigating whether an unusually high incidence of
autism in Brick Township, N.J., could be related to environmental
causes, or is simply a statistical artifact. There have been 40
cases of autism diagnosed among the 6,000 3- to 10-year-old
children living in the township, a rate that is at least triple the
estimated national average.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the overall rise in the incidence of autism
nationally has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to estimate prevalence,'' Dawson said.
``Twenty years ago, we said 4 or 5 out of 10,000. Today, we say 1
in 500 or 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if the increase in prevalence is accounted for
entirely by diagnostic methods getting better, or whether there is
an (actual) increase.'' Clinicians, however, say the increase is
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it's becoming more common,'' said psychology
professor Eric Trupin who heads the Division of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And some parents say the many competing theories don't have to
be mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autism causes such a broad spectrum (of symptoms),'' said
Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America and parent
of a 31-year-old son with autism. ``There has to be more than one
cause.''
