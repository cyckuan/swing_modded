It is stated that 20 out of a population of 10,000 in India
suffer from the spectrum disorder. Out of this, 80 percent
affected by autism are boys.

The Action for Autism, a non-profit organization based here, is
conducting a three-day training workshop for parents of autistic
children.

According to the Action for Autism, there are no medical or
genetic tests which can detect autism. Diagnosis of autism is not
easy, the onset may occur at birth, or a child may have a period
of normal development followed by a deterioration of verbal and
social skills around one-and-half to two-and-half years.
