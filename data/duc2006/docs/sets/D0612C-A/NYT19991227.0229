   Inspired by new findings on the way animal brains develop before
and after birth, scientists are developing provocative new theories
to explain autism, a mysterious brain abnormality that prevents
human infants from developing normal social and cognitive skills.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the anatomy of autistic brains, researchers are
trying to figure out when in development and where in the brain the
complex interaction of genes and environment causes things to go
astray. In the process, they are learning more about the brain
circuitry that gives rise to quintessential human traits like
language, empathy and the awareness that other people have beliefs
and desires different from one's own.
</P>
<P>
   An entire brain circuit has been compromised in autism, said Dr.
David G. Amaral, a neuroscientist at the University of California
at Davis. Researchers have only begun to study how different brain
regions interact dynamically to give rise to such circuits, he
said, which puts autism at the frontier of modern neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   Autism undermines many aspects of human behavior, including
movement, attention, learning, memory, language, mood and social
interaction. It can be detected in the movements of babies who roll
over, sit up, crawl and walk in oddly uncoordinated ways. At 18
months, an autistic toddler will not point, share attention with
others or follow the expressions of other people. By age 2 or 3,
autistic children display a profound lack of responsiveness to
others. Many do not talk; instead, they may engage in rituals, like
arm flapping, that stimulate their bodies. They dislike change of
any sort.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of autism range from mild to severe, making the
true incidence of the disorder difficult to assess, said Dr. Marie
Bristol-Power, who coordinates autism research at the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Classical autism in its more severe form, which results in
mental retardation, occurs in about one in every 1,000 births, she
said. When milder forms of autism like Aspberger's syndrome are
included, the incidence is one in 500. The common feature among all
children with autism is a lack of social relatedness.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are reporting what appear to be significant
increases in cases of autism, Dr. Bristol-Power said. But it is not
yet clear if the reports reflect higher incidence of the condition
or better diagnosis and the availability of better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, researchers believed that autism was caused by
cold ``refrigerator'' mothers and weak absent fathers. Today they
are zeroing in on genes. In identical twins, if one has autism, the
second will also have it 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   At least five or six genes contribute to autism, said Dr.
Bennett Leventhal, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the University of Chicago. Studies thus far of autistic siblings
suggest that these genes are on Chromosomes 7, 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   What these genes are doing is still anybody's guess. Studies of
developing animal brains have found numerous growth factors and
proteins that guide fetal brain cells into making proper
connections. Other genes make factors that act as master switches,
turning yet other genes on and off at particular points in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Some genes suppress cellular activity while others ramp it up,
setting the correct balance of chemicals involved in transmitting
brain signals. After birth, different genes begin to nurse
connections while others cause cells to die off in a dynamic dance
of growth and pruning.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth and elaboration of the nervous system is a
continuous process and if something goes seriously wrong early on,
all subsequent development may be disturbed. The question is, how
early and where.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia M. Rodier, an embryologist at the University of
Rochester School of Medicine, believes that the brain glitch in
autism occurs between days 20 and 24 of gestation, before a woman
knows she is pregnant. She has evidence that genes involved in
laying down basic body and brain structures, called hox genes, are
mutated in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret L. Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School,
believes that the defect may occur before the middle of the second
trimester of pregnancy. She bases this theory on her extensive
knowledge of how and when certain circuits are wired. Some cells
can be ``missing'' only if the defect occurs midway in fetal
development, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Eric Courchesne, a neuroscientist at the University of
California at San Diego, said that the problem could just as easily
occur after a baby is born and as the brain continues to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In October, researchers identified the precise genetic defect in
a disorder, Rett's syndrome, that was once commonly misdiagnosed as
autism. Babies are born and develop normally until they are between
about 6 months and 24 months old, when a gene that represses other
genes fails to shut down as it should. As a result, the other genes
do not swing into action and children stop growing, wring their
hands and become mentally retarded. Courchesne and other
researchers believe a similar process may be at work in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Like other brain researchers, scientists who study autism were
startled by recent discoveries that the human brain continues to
make new brain cells _ not just new connections, as was previously
thought _ well into adulthood. In fact, one scientist has evidence
that the number of neurons in the human brain doubles between birth
and 6 years.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, Courchesne said, the child's brain would be
undergoing a huge amount of construction created by the interplay
of genes and environment. It might be, he said, that disturbances
in this construction give rise to autism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This theory is supported, some researchers say, by the fact that
a quarter of autistic children appear normal until age 14-22 months
and then experience the sudden onset of autistic symptoms, said Dr.
Nancy J. Minshew, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The onset may be caused by a malfunction in one or more genes,
she said. Or it could be set off by something in the environment
interacting with a genetically vulnerable child.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, Dr. Bauman and her colleagues have been studying
brain tissue obtained in autopsies from autistic children and
adults. While large areas of the 11 brains they studied look
normal, she said, the brains are generally bigger and heavier than
most. Most important, there are abnormalities in three major
regions that help control social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the frontal lobes, which enable decision-making and
planning, are thicker than normal. Cells in the limbic system,
where emotions are processed, are a third smaller than normal and
are found in excessive numbers. The cells are also immature, with
stunted connections. Cells in the cerebellum _ a structure that
helps in making predictions about what will happen next in terms of
movements, thoughts and emotions _ are reduced by 30 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of autism can be traced to problems in each of these
regions, said Amaral, the neuroscientist at UC-Davis. For example,
neurons in the amygdala respond to faces and the angle of gaze.
Autistic children tend to ignore facial expressions, or at least do
not seem to read them well.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments show that autistic children can use their
cerebellums to shift attention when they are not paying attention
to a particular task. But when they are asked to make a conscious
decision about changing attention, a task that activates their
frontal lobes, they can no longer to do the task, presumably
because a larger circuit is engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies also shed light on the biology of social behavior
relevant to autism, Amaral said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, monkeys have brain cells that respond to moving
hands and faces but not other moving things. They have cells,
called mirror neurons, that fire when the monkey performs an
action, like gripping a handle bar, but also when the monkey
observes another monkey performing the same action. They have cells
that are activated by sights and sounds generated by others but not
by the same sights and sounds when they are self-generated. Perhaps
the human equivalent of these specialized cells are not functioning
properly in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments conducted on human autistic children suggest that
very specific elements of social behavior are abnormal. For
example, autistic children can use sabotage, but not deception, to
prevent another person from attaining a goal. They can use
communicative gestures, like ``come here,'' to affect another
person's behavior but not expressive gestures, like ``well done,''
to affect another's mental state. They can feel the basic pleasure
in mastering a task but not the pride, said Dr. Chris Frith, a
neuroscientist at University College London in England. An emotion
like pride requires taking into account other people's
expectations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of recent but not yet published experiments shows
that autistic children are bombarded by their own nervous systems,
making them more sensitive to stimuli, not less, said Portia
Iverson, the founder of Cure Autism Now, a parent group based in
Los Angeles, who is an expert on the disorder. ``If you hook a
normal person up to a device that measures arousal and make direct
eye contact,'' she said, ``you'd see maybe four spikes a minute. In
the same setting, the autistic child has a dozen or more spikes per
minute, plus the peaks are extremely high and low, more severe and
erratic. It's like you or I would feel during an earthquake, but
they feel that way all day long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In normal learning and memory, Ms. Iverson said, people encode
new information about 30 seconds after getting an arousal peak.
``But what if you have six times too many peaks?'' she asked. ``You
might encode enormous amounts of highly irrelevant information,
focusing on details that don't matter to the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Autism researchers agree that it will take many years before the
genetics and neurochemistry of the disorder are understood. In the
meantime, intensive one-on-one therapies that teach children how to
control their movements and interact socially succeed in 30 percent
to 50 percent of treated children, provided they start early,
ideally by age 2 or 3. The goal is to intercept the miswiring of
the autistic brain and, as the brain is developing, help it grow
the connections it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a great many austistic children, the disorder is not
diagnosed until age 5 or 6, when they start school, Dr.
Bristol-Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Most pediatricians and family doctors still believe that autism
is a relatively rare disorder and are not trained to pick up
symptoms, she said. Any child that is not speaking in short phrases
by age 2 should be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Iverson said: ``The fact that children's brains are dynamic
and resilient is our greatest hope. The very essence of a human
being is his or her interaction with the environment. If it's not
done right the first time, we can make it up with restorative and
regenerative therapies for the brain. We may not make kids
completely normal but we can change the course of the illness.''
