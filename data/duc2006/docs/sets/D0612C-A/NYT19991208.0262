   Repligen Corp. said Wednesday that secretin, its drug to treat
autism, does not appear to work after a single injection, although
company officials predicted that more positive results will appear
with higher doses.
</P>
<P>
   The Needham, Mass. biotechnology company said the New England
Journal of Medicine will publish Thursday a study by a North
Carolina group that independently tested the drug on 18 patients.
``A single dose of synthetic human secretin is not an effective
treatment for autism or pervasive developmental disorder,'' the
study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen, which owns the drug, was not involved in the
evaluation but plans to launch its own test early next year with
about 100 autistic children taking multiple doses over three or
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen stock closed Wednesday at 3 3/16, up 3/16.

   Autism affects 500,000 Americans and is a disorder in which a
young child cannot develop normal social relationships. There are
no drugs to directly treat the disorder, although in some cases
drugs are used to control aggressive and self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Many autistic youngsters also suffer from gastrointestinal
problems such as repeated diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen maintains that multiple doses _ not the single dose
results chronicled in the New England Journal of Medicine _ will
lead to changes in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids whose diarrhea disappears in 48 hours after taking
secretin tend to have normal stools and very often this leads to
improvement in autistic symptoms, such as better eye contact,
improved communications and trailing after siblings,'' said Walter
C. Herlihy, Repligen president and chief executive, officer whose
8-year-old daughter Lilian is autistic.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that in March, a Wall Street Journal article
revealed some promising results based on anecdotal evidence from
over 1,000 autistic patients who had used secretin as an
experimental drug. Those findings prompted a group of investors in
Ashville, N.C. to sponsor a formal clinical trial. However, they
relied on a single dose of secretin with four weeks of observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did is analogous to measuring behavioral changes in
an Alzheimer patient with one dose of a drug,'' said Herlihy. ``We
have always said a single dose does not produce significant
results.''
