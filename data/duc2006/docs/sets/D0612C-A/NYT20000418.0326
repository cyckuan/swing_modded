NO ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES FOUND FOR AUTISM IN NEW JERSEY TOWN 
</HEADLINE>

   In the first study in the country on the incidence of autism
among young children, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed
Tuesday that there was a striking number of autism cases in Brick
Township, N.J., but found no link between the disorder and
environmental factors in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials, who traveled to Brick Tuesday to report the
findings of their yearlong investigation, also said that, while
there were no other studies in the United States with which to
compare their results, the overall prevalence of autism in the
country might be higher than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   The study in Brick Township, prompted by the suspicions of one
couple with two autistic children who noticed many other autistic
children in their community, found a rate of 4 children with autism
per 1,000 between the ages of 3 and 10. In the of 72,000 people, 36
children are autistic, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies in Europe and Asia have indicated that as many as 2
of every 1,000 children have some type of autism, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates are higher than we previously thought in this
country, and nationwide, they may be more in line with what we
found in Brick,'' said Jacquelyn Bertrand, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's objectives were to verify the number of cases of
autism in Brick among the children who lived there during 1998 and
to examine whether the disorder was linked to chemicals in the
township's drinking water, its former landfill and the Metedeconk
River, where some residents swim.
</P>
<P>
   It found no such link. But the number of cases found surprised
some people involved in autism research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDC's findings are astonishing,'' said Dr. Eric London,
vice president of medical affairs for the National Alliance for
Autism Research in Princeton, which funds autism research.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a disorder that affects a child's ability to
communicate and function socially. It varies in severity and has no
known cause and no cure.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not confirm the presence of a ``cluster'' of
autism cases, a term used by those who have tried to link high
cases of a disorder or disease, such as cancers, to a geographic
location and its environment. But, London said, the study in Brick
might indicate there may be more autism cases nationwide than
anyone previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we simply do not have enough data to
determine the prevalence of autism in this country,'' London said.
``We do not know if this is an unusually high number or if it is
representative of autism prevalence in the United States. Only
through additional research will we be able to evaluate the
strikingly high numbers found in Brick to determine if they
reflectthe population or if there are disparities in the rates in
different geographic areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Centers for Disease Control held public
meetings all day Tuesday at the Brick Township Municipal Building
to inform people of their findings. At an informal briefing Tuesday
night, 30 to 40 people milled about, looking at the yellow and blue
research graphics on easels or on the walls and asked questions of
officials who wore name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the group were parents of autistic children who said
they were disappointed at the scope of the study, which was limited
to children who had lived there in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl and Bob Nichols of West Milford, in Northern New Jersey,
came to the meeting because they have a 9-year-old son who is
autistic. Nichols said she had contacted CDC officials to tell them
she had lived in Brick Township until she was 20 years old, before
she became pregnant with her son, but they did not include her in
the study because she did not fit into their parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it has something to do with the environment,''
Nichols said. ``They just haven't found it. They didn't even
interview us.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for the study of Brick Township's problem began through
the actions of Bobbie and William Gallagher, who had two autistic
children and found that many other autistic children lived near
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallaghers, with the help of a few other parents of autistic
children, conducted their own rudimentary survey of the histories
of these children and became concerned about a possible link
between Brick Township's environment and the incidence of autistic
births.
