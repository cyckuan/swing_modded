<P>
   Scientists for the first time have discovered what they believe
may be biological markers in the blood of newborn infants who later
develop autism and mental retardation. The markers consist of
abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals that help construct
the basic architecture of animal brains, researchers said. The
finding supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of
both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of
the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be
replicated in larger studies. But if it proves true, it could open
the door to new opportunities for treating these devastating mental
disorders that affect as many as six out of every 1,000 newborns.
If doctors can screen for autism and mental retardation at birth,
scientists say, affected babies could be given special early
enrichments or drugs designed to help their brains develop more
normally.
</P>
<P>
   The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by
Dr. Karin B. Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., was carried out
by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth
Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington
University Medical Center in Washington. Nelson said in a telephone
interview that the study was in the process of being submitted to a
scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   The new work ``is really exciting,'' said Dr. David Amaral, a
neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis and a
leading expert on neurodevelopmental disorders, who was not
involved in the study. The world of autism research is littered
with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of
attacking the problem at a basic scientific level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this study can be replicated and confirmed, it will be very
important,'' said Dr. Eric Courchesne, an autism expert at the
University of California in San Diego. People have been looking for
triggers, like measles vaccinations, to help explain the onset of
autism symptoms, he said. But this study suggests that the defects
may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas
about the cause of these disorders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could turn out that these brain proteins ``are not
predictive of anything,'' said Dr. Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist and
autism expert at the University of Chicago. ``The work is exciting
and I hope it's correct,'' he said, but the fact that four proteins
are elevated ``does not mean there is one simple pathway'' in the
brain to explain these disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental
retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain
chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said. But this notion
has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the
disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental
retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around
3 years old. There has never been a way to identify the babies who
might have these brain abnormalities and so researchers have not
been able study the problem early in life.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings are the result of a collaboration of
researchers from three scientific disciplines: neurochemistry,
epidemiology and analytical immunochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Neurochemists have identified many brain proteins that help
cells survive, make connections between cells and lay the basis for
learning and memory, Nelson said. The thinking was that some of
these molecules might be involved in autism and mental retardation,
but which ones remained a mystery. ``We chose eight of them,''
Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects
Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley. The program, established
nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in
seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to
help track down causes of birth defects. For example, the program
recently helped show a link between babies born with cleft palates
and mothers who smoked cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples are stored in a warehouse and can be fetched
any time epidemiologists have questions to explore, said Dr. John
Harris, director of the program. In this case, staff members in the
program went to clinics in Northern California and located
teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism,
65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls. All the teen-agers
were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in
the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were sent to Dr. Terry Phillips, an immunochemist at
George Washington University and at the Office of Research Services
at the National Institutes of Health who uses sophisticated new
techniques to fish tiny amounts of proteins out of blood samples.
Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers,
he said. But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in
nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers. None of
the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy
had elevated levels of these proteins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns''
present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop
autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers
said. While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a
gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said. Too
much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in
development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to
be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique
used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that
more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not
normal in regard to these proteins at birth.

   But researchers who are familiar with the four proteins said the
finding was highly provocative given what was known about them. For
example, Dr. Douglas Brenneman, chief of the section on
developmental and molecular pharmacology at the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, said one
protein, VIP, was akin to a master molecule used for ``putting
brains together.'' It exerts powerful effects on at least a dozen
brain chemicals, including the other three identified in this
study, he said. Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the
mother's immune cells. After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of
the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in
other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin, a digestive hormone that is being given to many
autistic children with the hope that it will alleviate their
behavioral problems, is in the VIP family, Brenneman said. But
there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines
can ever get into the brain, he said. Nearly every controlled
clinical trial of secretin has failed to show that the hormone
works as claimed, Amaral said. On the other hand, there could be
``brain and gut interactions'' that are not yet understood. This
finding about biological markers ``opens the barn door wide open to
look for deeper causes of autism and mental retardation,'' Harris
said. ``Until now, we didn't even know this barn door was there.''
