LINK OF VACCINATIONS AND AUTISM EXPLORED AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday,
Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform
committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department
of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial
study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after arguments among witnesses and sparring
between leaders of the House Government Reform Committee, in which
the hearing was held. The hearing was called by Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., whose granddaughter has autism, and who believes
she may have got it from a vaccine _ even though current research
has not found any connection between getting vaccines for measles,
mumps and rubella, and the onset of the brain disorder, autism.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking minority leader on
the committee, prodded witnesses and complained to Burton that the
hearing was unfairly stacked to show a connection. He said that
while getting the science right was important, in this case getting
parents to mistrust vaccines would certainly lead to deaths from
diseases society has mostly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream medical organizations and leaders in the field of
immunization agree that there is no convincing evidence for the
theory that the vaccine called MMR _ measles, mumps and rubella _
causes autism, a brain disorder characterized by an inability to
socialize and a tendency to engage in constantly repeated actions
or comments.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause
some cases of autism is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and
University College Medical School in London. He said he took his
cue from parents whose experience of autism seemed to be different
than the usual. The disease is suspected in most cases of being
genetic, and it appears gradually in the first two years of life as
a failure to speak, the beginning of repetitive motions, and a
withdrawal from social interaction. But the parents Wakefield dealt
with said it came on rather suddenly, over a period of months, and
often just after vaccination with the triple vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The signature symptoms, he reports, are bowel pain, inflammation
and erratic bowel habits, in children who also begin to show the
usual mental symptoms of autism. Wakefield has published studies on
a dozen such cases, and will soon publish reports on another 60. He
said there is some suggestive laboratory work, as well, but the
chief message he said was: ``Here is something we need to study.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side, apart from the skepticism of most of the
medical community, is Dr. Brent Taylor, a senior colleague of
Wakefield at the same London Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has done the largest and best-controlled study to date on
the subject, of 498 autistic children in London. He found no
relation between the children's vaccination dates and the onset of
their disease. The disease is usually diagnosed when retarded
development shows up in the first two years of life; vaccination
usually is done at about 16 months of age; Parents and doctors
noticing the two coming together could be coincidental, he
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that whatever the case with most autism, ``We owe it
to our children and grandchildren to ensure we're being diligent in
looking for causes of autism. We can't stick our heads in the sand
and ignore the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the parents who told their stories, and who became
teary-eyed along with most in the packed hearing room was Shelly
Reynolds of Baton Rouge. She said her son Liam was the normal
bubbly child who would sing `itsy bitsy spider,' and chime in with
Eieio on `Old McDonald.' But within days of his vaccination, she
said, he became either unruly or spaced-out, and lost his ability
to speak and interact.
</P>
<P>
   She told the committee that you cannot miss such sudden awful
and sudden changes if you are a parent. ``Parents like me are
relying on you to demand that the pharmaceutical companies retrace
their steps once again, and the public health community look at the
possibility that these things might not be a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the whole question, and making it more urgent at
the same time, is the dramatic rise in the reporting of autism in
several countries, including the United States. In the 1960s,
various estimates suggested there were about one to four cases of
autism for every 10,000 children. By the 1990s, the numbers had
shot up more than four-fold to 12 per 10,000 in England, and
two-to-five fold in different studies in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether the increase is due to increased
reporting of the disease, which has become much better known in
recent years, especially after the film `Rain Man' about an
autistic man.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to exchanges of scientific details for two
hours, Waxman read the language of a proposed letter to the
secretary of Health and Human Services asking for an impartial
study of the question; Burton agreed to co-sign it, but added that
he will continue to dog the issue with further hearings until
better answers are forthcoming.
