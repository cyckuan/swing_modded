   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, parents clamored for the hormone
secretin in hopes it would help their autistic children. Put to the
test, however, secretin is proving disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new theory is triggering desperate parents' interest -- and
this time the stakes are higher because it could spur misuse of the
nation's most precious antibiotic, vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a
bizarre-sounding experiment, testing whether vancomycin might help
her son's severe autism. To their surprise, little Andrew Bolte got
better.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Sandler of Rush Children's Hospital in Chicago was
skeptical of Ellen Bolte's theory that a neurotoxin-producing
intestinal infection was behind some of her son's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   He administered the antibiotic anyway. Andrew ''was not cured,
but all of a sudden he started saying words, became
toilet-trained,'' Sandler recalled. ''I found that very intriguing.
It's not supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sandler treated 11 autistic children who, like about a third
of children with this serious brain disorder, also suffer painful
gastrointestinal problems. Neuropsychological testing concluded
that 10 children improved, he reports in this month's Journal of
Child Neurology -- but only for a while.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem: Andrew and the others worsened again
after just a few months. Yet already parents are calling doctors
about vancomycin. That's worrisome because overuse of vancomycin,
considered the best weapon against the problem of
antibiotic-resistant infections, will spur germs to become
impervious to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a danger,'' said Sandler, who has quit using vancomycin,
calling it inappropriate until more research proves if it is a real
clue or a false lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chicagoan, Dr. Michael Chez, plans to compare vancomycin
to a dummy drug this fall, important because simple attention
during medical research markedly helps autistic children, the
so-called ''placebo effect.'' (Send an e-mail to rushstudy@aol.com

</P>
<P>
   Like other autism experts, Johns Hopkins University neurologist
Dr. Andrew Zimmerman is bracing for families' calls. ''It's
heartbreaking, because you know they really want answers,'' yet the
study is far too weak to back antibiotic use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's ''provocative,'' Zimmerman said, because scientists
are scrutinizing whether bowel problems are caused by or worsen
autistic symptoms, or are a coincidental side effect of the
terrible brain disorder.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 Americans have autism, characterized by
profound social withdrawal, inability to communicate, repetitive
behavior and sometimes aggression. No one knows what causes it,
although much research suggests something goes wrong during
critical fetal brain development.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand children have taken secretin, an intestinal
hormone, after a mother said one dose brought her son out of
autistic isolation. But in scientific studies, secretin so far has
proved no better than a dummy injection.
</P>
<P>
   Intense behavior therapy is autism's only proven treatment. But
Andrew Bolte was so aggressive the therapy didn't stand a chance,
his mother said. He screamed for hours. He even chewed drywall from
the walls. Complicating matters were severe diarrhea and other
gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bolte blames antibiotics prescribed for fluid in Andrew's ears
shortly before he became autistic at 19 months. Her unproven
theory: those drugs killed Andrew's normal gut-protective bacteria,
allowing an intestinal infection that can produce nerve-killing
toxins, which entered his brain. Vancomycin, she thought, could
kill that infection.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six doctors scoffed. After all, autism typically appears
between ages 14 and 22 months, and no sufferers have ever been
found with neurotoxic infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler called it ''highly improbable,'' too, but he tried
because Andrew, by now 3, was miserable. Two months later, Andrew
was ''very calm,'' allowed Bolte to hug him and finally followed
verbal commands.
</P>
<P>
   Aggression and other symptoms soon returned. But Bolte believes
vancomycin eased his bowel problem enough to open a window for
behavior therapy, saying Andrew retained his language improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Even she cautions against demanding vancomycin, however.
Instead, she is raising money for bacterial research.
