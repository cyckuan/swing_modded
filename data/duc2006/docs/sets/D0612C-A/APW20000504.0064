<HEADLINE> New Test May Identify Autism Risk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new test aimed at helping doctors predict
whether newborn children will develop autism or mental retardation
confirms that such disorders are present at birth and are not the
result of nurturing, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Autism likely arises from a combination of genetic defects and
exposure to toxic chemicals, viruses or other environmental
substances, according to the California Birth Defects Monitoring
Program, which is run jointly by the state and the March of Dimes.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial period for such factors is the early weeks of
pregnancy as the central nervous system forms, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't use the word breakthrough lightly, but that is what
this (test) looks like to me,'' said Dr. John Harris, chief of the
program. ''This could potentially have a huge impact on society.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported Wednesday at a San Diego meeting of the
American Academy of Neurology, could lead to better treatment for
patients and new ways to prevent the disorders, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned that the results have not yet been formally
published and reviewed by other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents believe that autism can be caused by adverse
reactions to disease vaccinations because many children develop the
first signs of the mental disorder after immunization at 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the monitoring program examined stored blood samples
collected from 249 infants during the 1980s. The researchers found
unusually high levels of four proteins associated with brain
development in nearly all the samples from children who later were
diagnosed with autism or mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the proteins appeared in infants who developed normally.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really is an exciting finding, but it doesn't mean
scientists have a specific test for autism, since mentally retarded
children had the same elevated protein levels,'' Dr. David Amaral
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral is director of the MIND Institute at the University of
California, Davis, which provided part of the funding for the
study.
</P>
<P>
   For both mental retardation and autism, this is the first time a
clear biological marker has been identified at such an early age,
said Walter Herlihy, president of Repligen Corp. The company is
testing a hormone called secretin as a potential treatment for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to go back and incorporate this in our clinical
trials to see if the markers are present in older children as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To validate its own research, the monitoring program is
preparing to study as many as 5,000 autistic children, said Dr.
Judith K. Grether, the study's principal researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The findings will be compared to tests of several thousand
healthy children serving as a control group, she said. The
validation study is expected to take five years to complete.
