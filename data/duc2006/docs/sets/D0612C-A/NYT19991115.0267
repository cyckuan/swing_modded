   When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one
of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an
experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged
with calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one slots.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred families.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response is an indication of how desperate
families are for something that works better than available
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes surrounding secretin, a natural digestive hormone that may
help treat autism, have been building since two parents
accidentally discovered that the hormone appeared to help their
autistic child. In 1996, Victoria and Gary Beck of New Hampshire
went to a gastrointestinal specialist to help diagnose some
digestive difficulties in their autistic son, Parker. The doctor
injected the boy with porcine secretin, a hormone commonly used to
assess gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the doctor's visit, Parker's autistic traits began
improving dramatically. He went from being non-verbal before the
injection to saying words. Initially, the Becks had to fight with
skeptical doctors to get them to acknowledge that secretin might
have had something to do with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The biological explanation is not as far-fetched as it might
seem.
</P>
<P>
   On a basic level, the ``purpose of the brain is to keep the
stomach full,'' said Dr. Alan Unis, professor of psychiatry at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The brain and the gut communicate with each other. ``They need
to have a common language,'' Unis said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin, which binds to receptors in both the gut and the
brain, could form that link. It is plausible that altering secretin
levels could affect brain function.
</P>
<P>
   It has not taken much convincing for other parents. Publicity
about the Becks story has fueled worldwide demand for the hormone,
creating shortages and driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   That worried the National Institutes of Health. Although
secretin is approved for use as a one-time injection as a
diagnostic agent for stomach problems, it hasn't yet been approved
for multiple injections as a therapeutic agent. Concerned that
children were being given an untried drug with unknown results, the
NIH expedited a clinical trial to study the drug's potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle group is testing a preparation similar to that used
in the Becks' case. The preparation, derived from pigs, is about 60
percent secretin and 40 percent unknown ``pig gut'' ingredients.
Researchers are also testing a pure, synthesized version of
secretin. The purpose of including both is to rule out the
possibility that some other unknown compound in the porcine
secretin preparation is having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Each child will get one injection of secretin or a placebo and
be evaluated for effects one month later. Researchers expect to
have preliminary results in about six months. Children began
receiving the injections late last month.
</P>
<P>
   However high the hopes, experts warn that secretin is not the
first treatment to look promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autism has a terrible history of wild cures,'' said Eric
Trupin, a UW psychology professor who is also director of the child
and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some work for a few families. None seems to work for all. Most
have not been scientifically tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very vulnerable group,'' said Audrey Horne, president
of the Autism Society of America. ``Most parents, there's not a
thing they wouldn't do if they thought it would cure their child.''
</P>
<P>
   That has led to a parade of treatments, including megavitamins,
special diets, auditory training, ``holding therapy'' and swimming
with dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Such treatments gain footholds in part because there is a
powerful ``placebo effect'' at work. Parents are often so hopeful
for results, they see them where objective observers would not.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have seen hopes raised by drugs before.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, fenfluramine, a drug that reduces the blood level
of serotonin, was being touted as a wonder drug for autism. About
one-third of children with autism have higher than normal levels of
serotonin, another chemical that acts in both the digestive system
and the brain. Initial optimism about the drug faded after studies
failed to find beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, secretin seems promising. Researchers caution, however,
that although it is tempting to hope for a pill or a shot that will
make autism go away, the reality is likely to be much more
complicated. Based on anecdotal reports, secretin seems to have
some beneficial effect in about half the families that try it, Unis
said. It may be that there is a subtype of autism that responds to
secretin.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the lack of scientific backing for many
treatments, parents have begun organizing to raise money and press
for better research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure
Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of
``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help
speed the identification of genes associated with autism. In just
over three years, the bank has enrolled 465 families, creating an
unrivaled genetic data bank for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has a grandson with autism, has
co-sponsored legislation to earmark $46.5 million for autism
research. The legislation failed this fall, but autism advocates
have vowed to redouble their efforts to get the funding this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Better understanding of the disease is likely to lead to better
treatments, Horne said. ``With autism, we're just beginning to come
out of the dark ages.''
