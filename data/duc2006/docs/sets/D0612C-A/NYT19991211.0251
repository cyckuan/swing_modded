<P>
   It's time, once again, for the screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Evan O'Neal, 4, ambles into an examination room at the Southwest
Autism Research Center cradling a worn Big Bird. His other hand, as
usual, hangs from his mouth like a large extra tooth.
</P>
<P>
   As he's hoisted onto the table for an injection to test
secretin, the drug his parents hope will cure his autism, Evan
explodes with a piercing, sirenlike scream. His father drapes his
body over the writhing boy. The doctor with the needle hums in a
soothing baritone. Evan's mother strokes his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Evan stops long enough for a couple of mucus-choked coughs.
Then, he screams again.
</P>
<P>
   As Evan flails, the needle pops out. As the doctors and nurses
scramble to reinsert it, Evan's arms come free and he grabs his
father as if his neck were the last life preserver on a sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Evan's mother, Mary, also draped over her son, starts singing
the alphabet. His father, Benton, joins in. So do the nurses and
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it working?'' one asks.
</P>
<P>
   Another responds, half-jokingly, ``I don't know about him, but
it's comforting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute procedure seems to last a day. Finally, his
parents rip off the Velcro restraints. Dazed and red-eyed, Evan
grabs Big Bird and wanders off to a playroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' someone says, ``I hope he got the real thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Evan is one of the lucky ones. Out of hundreds of candidates, he
was one of 30 Valley children selected for the double-blind test.
Two-thirds of the kids got secretin, the drug that many believe
will cure the enigma that is autism.
</P>
<P>
   More and more families are suffering its heartbreaking effects.
</P>
<P>
   Their babies are born seemingly typical; then, within two or
three years, they stop looking Mom and Dad in the eye, they stop
making sense when they talk. Some stop communicating at all.
</P>
<P>
   In some profound way, autism throws a child's world out of
balance. Either the child becomes overly sensitive and withdrawn,
or nothing stimulates him and he become disengaged. Everything, it
seems, is too much or too little.
</P>
<P>
   Such children can't distinguish their grandparents from
strangers. They can't look forward to Christmas or make best
friends. Hardly ever do they say, ``I love you, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   They wear weighted vests in preschool play circles to keep their
bodies, at least, from wandering off. They scream when movie
theater lights go down. They live in houses without doorknobs.
Houses where playmates never come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, physically, they look like other children. How do you so
completely lose your child who's right there, nestled in your arms?
</P>
<P>
   So, parents cling to the idea that there ``is'' an answer, that
it will take only one good nudge to bring their child back. And,
like Mary O'Neal, they pray that secretin is that nudge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Evan's day begins with a ritual to reinforce that he's part of
this world.
</P>
<P>
   While her son is still in his pajamas, O'Neal firmly massages
his arms and legs. Then, she gently pushes up against his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some with autism get too much stimulation. It's like living with
a headful of stereo speakers and a psychedelic light show, so they
turn off their senses and seem blank.
</P>
<P>
   But other autistic children, like Evan, have too little
sensitivity. Evan once grabbed a cactus and got a palmful of
needles; he didn't cry. His eardrum burst; he didn't cry.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neal presses against her son's pale skin, she sings softly.
He never looks at her. He wiggles down into his parents' dark green
comforter. His back is rigid, his head cocked. He listens intently
to something no one else hears.
</P>
<P>
   When the 45-minute massage is done, Evan skitters across the
room, his arms flapping to continue the stimulation. The flapping
is so typical that parents and researchers call it ``stimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan never played with any of his toys, O'Neal recalls. But he
loved carrying around his father's blow dryer and listening to the
noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought that was the greatest thing since cream cheese,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   When Evan was 2{, his pediatrician delivered a diagnosis that
sounded more like a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 20 minutes with him and closed her book and said to
us, `Well, I think he is autistic, probably mentally retarded. You
should probably be aware of the fact that you will have to put him
in an institution someday,' '' O'Neal says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the O'Neals have tried to outfox the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   They've eliminated wheat and cow's milk from Evan's diet. Added
vitamins. Attended support groups. Consulted doctors and more
doctors. Analyzed and reanalyzed his urine. Searched the Internet.
Second-guessed themselves. Gone through physical therapy, speech
therapy, occupational therapy. They've turned their living room
into a gym.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Mary O'Neal, 39, watches her younger son, Tim, for
signs of autism. The risk of having a second autistic child is
about one in 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast counter, O'Neal leans into Evan's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Tim?'' she coos. Evan points to his brother.
Delighted, her face nearly splits with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks, ``Where's Mommy?'' He points to her.
</P>
<P>
   Then she asks, ``Where's Evan?'' His gaze wanders off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our highs are so high,'' O'Neal says.
</P>
<P>
   That's because everything is such a struggle. Evan doesn't like
things near his face, so he can stand to have only half of his
teeth brushed at a time. He doesn't like mushy foods. He screams
when he touches Play-Doh. He's never been calm enough to eat at
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I would give my right (arm) not to do this,'' O'Neal
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I used to take the easy way out. I was a follower,
not a leader, but I can't be that way anymore. I am his advocate,
and I cannot let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, she spends her days trying to get her son potty-trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he's cute now,'' she says. ``But no one is going to want
to change his diapers when he's 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan doesn't speak, emitting only an undulating warble when he's
excited or happy. But he can grab the picture cards attached to
objects throughout the house to indicate when he wants to watch a
video.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smallest payoffs demand vast patience.
</P>
<P>
   Evan can now dunk a ball into a hoop 4 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a year to do that,'' his mother says proudly,
sadly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to set them off?'' Karen Jason wonders as she
waits for her two kids after school.
</P>
<P>
   Jason carries that worry around all day, starting at 6 a.m. when
she hides their shoes and socks in the trunk of her car. If they
saw them, they'd throw a fit and never leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her best efforts, something goes awry. Instead of
getting off the school bus and running toward her, 6-year-old Sean
runs the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   He's like a hummingbird with a snootful of caffeine. Running
behind a pole, zigzagging across the parking lot, completely
unmindful of people and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Jason, her face flushed, chases him, scoops him up and gives him
a piggy-back ride. It does no good to scold him; words ricochet
off.
</P>
<P>
   Jason speaks deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean, Sean. We have to get into the car. Rebecca is waiting
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though onlookers are fascinated by the spectacle, Rebecca
pays it no mind. At 8, Sean's big sister doesn't have an ounce of
girlishness or silliness. She gives off no sparks, no spasms of
giggles or tears. She is purposeful as she plays, her mouth set in
a straight line that almost never bends.
</P>
<P>
   This is Karen Jason's family: Sean, the rambunctious 6-year-old
with the mind of a 3-year-old, and Rebecca, quiet and aloof but
considered high-functioning because she communicates more easily.
</P>
<P>
   With both of her children diagnosed as autistic, ``in my world,
it's autism that is normal,'' Jason says.
</P>
<P>
   To live in her world, you have to know the language. What Jason
calls ``video talk'' is the only way Sean communicates.
</P>
<P>
   When someone gets angry at him, Sean puts his fist in the
person's face and says, ``Will this help?'' It's not a threat, it's
a line from ``The Prince and the Pauper'' when Mickey Mouse shows
his regal ring and is released from his captors.
</P>
<P>
   At times, translation is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jason made an unexpected potty stop. Because they were in
an elementary school after hours, Sean's words echoed in the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Sean started roaring. To Jason, it made sense. The echoing made
the same sounds as ``Once Upon A Forest,'' a favorite dinosaur
movie.
</P>
<P>
   But his roaring was so loud that the school staff gave them
dirty looks as they left the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After she told them he was autistic, they apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told them, `Thanks for the look,' '' Jason says.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary school teacher, Jason knows it's a gamble to take
her kids out. Once interested in something, they become fixated.
After spending six hours in a Disney store, they want to stay and
will scream like extras in a horror movie when it's time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   When Sean wants reassurance, he'll rush over to Jason and wiggle
his head into her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He craves that kind of pressure,'' his mother says. ``Of
course, it looks really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason knows she must get her kids out of their usual life with
its built-in eccentricities _ Sean must have his right sock and
shoe on before putting on his left sock. She's got to get them into
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   So, damn the dirty looks, full speed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   She's enrolled them in special baseball programs and had them in
talent shows. She takes them grocery shopping even though the trips
take twice as long and often end up in temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Jason will sneak into her son's room and rearrange his
two dozen stuffed animals, just to provoke him into communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pick your battles,'' she says. Some nights, she
lets them interrupt dinner for the umpteenth time to make sure the
computer screen hasn't gone blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so regimented because they like it that way,''
Jason says. ``Life has glitches, and they have to get used to
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jason sits expectantly in the center's waiting room as
children like Evan O'Neal scream while getting shots. The
expectation level is so feverish that the waiting room feels like a
prayer hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, playing with his omnipresent stuffed-animal gang, is
oblivious of the other children's screams. Rebecca, as suspicious
as an old woman, frets around the room.
</P>
<P>
   For so long, Jason has been doing the best she can _ coping,
praying, cajoling, crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could this drug actually help them?'' she wonders, for the
thousandth time. ``Is this what they need?'' &QL;
