<P>
   The discovery that autistic children appear to have subtle
abnormalities in body movements that can be diagnosed as early as 3
months old is leading researchers to hope for new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the
University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary. But they
have generated intense interest because for the first time, a
method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies
whose brains are still developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least
3 years old. But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism
earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be
able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition,
when the brain is its most malleable.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects
about 5 of every 10,000 children. While autistic children appear
healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show
no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head
banging, with no apparent purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies
who were later found to be autistic. These infants showed a
specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over,
sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary.
Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see
exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which
suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's on to something,'' said Dr. Dan Geschwind, a
neurogeneticist at the University of California at Los Angeles and
scientific adviser to Cure Autism Now, an organization based in Los
Angeles run by parents of autistic children. ``He's got a very
intriguing piece of preliminary data which, if it turns out to be
true, will be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple Grandin, a highly functioning autistic woman who is an
assistant professor of animal science at Colorado State University
in Fort Collins and an authority on animal behavior, said: ``He's
on to something really good, and I fully support it. I like the
fact that he is objectively measuring something that is
biological.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general
problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism. But
even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and
teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and
special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said:
``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality
about autism that has been missed. We tend to think it's a problem
with the mind. But now that we are really beginning to see how the
brain works, we know that the mind is embodied. Body is part of
mind and there's no way to separate them.''

<P>
   Teitelbaum said he got the idea of looking at autism as a
movement disorder partly because of his work with brain-damaged
animals. As they recover, he said, they go through predictable
stages, for example recovery of movement, that reflect fundamental
aspects of brain organization. Because human babies also pass
through predictable stages of development, he theorized that
defects in the brain might be reflected in early movements.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Teitelbaum sent out word to parents of autistic
children through various national organizations that he was looking
for videotapes of babies before their autism was diagnosed. He
received 17 tapes that showed the babies during major milestones of
motor development, including rolling over, sitting, crawling,
standing and walking.
</P>
<P>
   He also videotaped 15 normal infants as they passed through the
same milestones. Portions of each tape were analyzed, using a
special technique, for subtle differences in patterns of movement.
</P>
<P>
   No two babies develop motor skills in exactly the same way, but
the autistic babies show a specific cluster of movement
abnormalities, Teitelbaum said. Some were subtle and others quite
obvious. Normal children may temporarily show some of the same
movements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, none of the autistic babies in the tapes learned to
roll over like normal children did, he said. Normal babies use a
corkscrew motion to go from back to stomach or vice versa. Starting
at about 3 months old, they first turn their pelvis to one side,
followed by the trunk and finally the shoulders and head. By 6
months, the order is reversed: the head goes first and the rest of
the body parts follow, corkscrew fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the autistic babies in the tapes never learned to roll
over. Others did, but in a peculiar fashion, Teitelbaum said.
Starting from lying on their sides, they rolled to their stomachs
or backs by raising heads and pelvises. Then they threw the upper
legs forward and toppled over, moving all body segments together.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike healthy babies who usually learn to sit up at 6
months, even while turning the torso or head, some of the infants
whose autism was diagnosed later on toppled easily, falling to one
side ``like a log'' and failing to break the falls with their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, who described his findings in a recent issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also noted
anomalies in the way the autistic babies in the tapes learned to
crawl and walk.
</P>
<P>
   Babies typically start to crawl at about the same time they
begin to sit, holding their bodies symmetrically with arms vertical
at shoulder width, palms on floor, fingers pointed forward. Thighs
are vertical and hip-width apart with knees on the ground and lower
legs and feet resting on the floor pointing backward. Weight is
commonly distributed equally on all four limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The autistic children in the study showed an asymmetrical lack
of support in the arms or legs, Teitelbaum said. One baby supported
himself on his forearms rather than his hands. He raised his pelvis
high in the air, bird-dog fashion, but could not move forward.
Another baby crawled by scooting his left knee on the floor but
used his right foot to push himself forward.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said that every autistic child showed some degree of
asymmetry in walking. Many tended to shift their weight at the
wrong moment, which made their walking appear slightly stiff.
Others kept their arms in a more infantile position, arms extended
forward. Interestingly, many autistic children walk more slowly and
with shorter steps, like Parkinson's disease patients whose motor
skills are damaged, Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who
theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that
develop before birth. Some researchers think the glitch occurs as
early as the 20th to 24th day of gestation, long before women know
they are pregnant. Others believe the injury, which could be a
mutation or environmental insult, occurs later on, perhaps in the
second trimester of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, researchers say that in autistic people, most of
the brain forms normally but that some basic scaffolding of nerve
fibers is incomplete or improperly developed. Because the human
brain grows rapidly in the first year of life _ literally
constructing circuits that will last a lifetime _ this is the best
time to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of intervention would be to stimulate the baby's brain
to circumvent the bad wiring or develop connections to compensate
for a defect, Donnellan said. By correcting movements through some
form of physical therapy, it may be possible to used feedback to
help correct abnormal brain development.
