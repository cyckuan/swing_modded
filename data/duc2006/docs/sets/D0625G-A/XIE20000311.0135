NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than eighty people have died
of malaria within the past two months at the Kisii General
Hospital in Nyanza Province in western Kenya, newspapers reported
on Saturday.

According to records at the hospital, 38 people died in
January, 33 in February while 10 others in the first week of
March. Over 5,000 cases of malaria have been handled in the
hospital during this period.

Anti-malaria drugs, including quinine injectables and tablets,
were sent to the area last week, said acting superintendent J. O.
Ogato in Kisii on Friday.

Kenyan Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri, who recently carried
out an anti-malaria awareness campaign in the region, said his
government is well- prepared to tackle the annual highland
malaria menace that afflicts the areas at the onset of the long
rains between March and June.

The government would not allow a repeat of what happened last
year when the disease killed thousands of people including school
children, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has stocked enough anti-malaria
drugs in all health facilities in the country to manage any
outbreak in the malaria prone areas.

<P>
Malaria and HIV/AIDS are the leading killer diseases in Kenya.

"The government spends a lot of money to cure 20 million
Kenyans who contract malaria annually," Ongeri said.
