92,000 children under the age of five in Kenya die annually due
malnutrition and attendant diseases, the East African Standard

And for every 1,000 births in east Africa's Uganda and
Tanzania, 141 children die of the same causes, said Ratemo

Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), at an ongoing international

malnutrition, he said.

He noted that about 200 million children under the age
of five in developing countries are malnourished and incapable of
fighting diseases.
