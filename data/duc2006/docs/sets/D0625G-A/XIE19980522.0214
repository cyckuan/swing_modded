<HEADLINE> L. Victoria Flooding Wreaks Havoc in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Kenyans and 7,500
animals have been displaced by the continuing flooding caused by
the rising Lake Victoria waters.
</P>
<P>
About 8,200 acres of crop have been destroyed in Nyando,
southwest Kenya alone, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which burst its banks last week for the first time
in three decades, has affected the entire shoreline in Busia,
Siaya, Bondo, Kisumu, Nyando, Rachuonyo, Homa bay and Suba
districts.
</P>
<P>
Many families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped by
the floods and drowned, entire villages and schools swept away
and other houses submerged as the lake waters engulf the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have
been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods, while
lack of communication also worsens the situation.
</P>
<P>
Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the
help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts
of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western
highlands.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year,
water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept
across the region, claiming scores of lives.
</P>
<P>
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in
Kenya although the country only holds about six percent of the
lake's 2,760 cubic km of water, with Tanzania taking up 49
percent and Uganda 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes
which some experts argue are a result of siltation due to the
blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
</P>
<P>
Among other explanations from experts are the shrinking
shoreline which has not been surveyed for more than 50 years and
the heavy El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has been asked to investigate a claim
that a blocked outlet near the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, Uganda
could have caused the sudden rise in the levels of the lake
water.
