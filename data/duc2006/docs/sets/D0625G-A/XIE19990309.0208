will equal the entire 1993/1994 recurrent budget of the Ministry

in Kenya is HIV-positive and this figure would increase to a four
to one ratio, the Eastern African Standard newspaper reported

skilled workers," Director of Planning Kang'ethe Gitu in the
ministry said last week.

and deaths take their toll, small scale farming will decline
sharply due to lack of laborers.
