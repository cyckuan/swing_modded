<HEADLINE> 14% of Kenyan Infected with HIV: Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has said that 14 out of 100 Kenyans are infected by HIV,
the virus which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's productive age group is in danger of being wiped out
by the disease, Saitoti said Monday at the opening of a workshop
on advocacy and communication on HIV/AIDS in Eldoret, a city in
west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti told the participants that nearly 500 Kenyans die of
AIDS everyday, making it the biggest killer of Kenyans in the
productive age group of 15 to 49.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Tuesday quoted the vice-president as saying that
18 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 are infected by the
virus every year.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti urged teachers, parents and church leaders to inform
the youth on the dangers of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Research by the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases
 Control indicates that more than 1.9 million adults and 100,000
children in Kenya are infected with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there are more than 700,000 children
orphaned by AIDS in the country, saying "this figure could reach
1.5 million by 2005 given the current trends of AIDS-related
death."
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said there is also a rise in mother-child
transmission of HIV in Kenya, with 30 to 40 percent of the
children born to the mothers with HIV being infected with the AIDS
virus during breast feeding.
