NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Top medical experts have
flown to Kenya's Northeastern Province to investigate the
mysterious disease which claimed over 160 lives in the last four
days, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A urgent response medical team has arrived in the province,
which comprises experts from the Kenya's Ministry of Health,
World Health Organization, Kenya Medical Research Institute and
Africa Medical Research Fund.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical
Services, as saying Tuesday that the experts listed 12 possible
diseases including yellow and Rift Valley fevers, Marburg fever
and severe malaria.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease are diarrhoea, high fever and
bleeding from the mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
Mwanzia said that the disease which is said to kill people
within 36 hours could be a mix of malaria and dysentery because
of the flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the
warm spell which followed.
</P>
<P>
He said that relevant specimens would be flown to Nairobi on
daily basis for analysis.
