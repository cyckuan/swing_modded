NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is

The reviewed act will create an enabling and conducive
environment in the fight against the killing disease, Kenyan
Minister of Public Health Sam Onger Monday told a sub-regional
meeting of the United Nations Theme Groups on International
Partnership against HIV/AIDS in Africa.

The new act will address a wide range of issues concerning
environmental, sanitary and housing problems, Onger was quoted as
saying.

It will also address the current loopholes which encourage the
spread of the deadly disease, the minister added.

Since the first case of AIDS was discovered in Kenya in 1984,
1.9 million of the over 30 million Kenyans have been affected by
the virus.
