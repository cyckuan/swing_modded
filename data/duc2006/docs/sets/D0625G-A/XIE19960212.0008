NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and the World Bank

control and prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI)
and the killer disease of AIDS in the east African state.

Launching the project in Nairobi today, the Kenyan Minister

U.S. million dollars to the project, while the World Bank
provided 40.5 million U.S. dollars of financial aid.

Angatia called on international aid institutions and donors
countries to make further donations to the AIDS-ridden country,

estimated 14 million U.S. dollars each year.

in their efforts to control and prevent the spread of the
diseases, but emphasised a change of unhealthy habits to check
their spread.

The minister also urged various NGOs related to control and
prevention of AIDs to continue supplementing the government
efforts in reducing the AIDS cases in the country.
