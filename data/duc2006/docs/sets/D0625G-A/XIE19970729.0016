<HEADLINE> Chloroquin to Be Phased Out in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
that chloroquin drugs will soon be phased out in favor of
sulphur-based drugs as the first line of treatment for malaria,
"The East African" reported today.
</P>
<P>
John Ouma, head of the Division of Vector Borne Diseases at
the Health Ministry, was quoted as saying that a recent study in
malaria-affected areas revealed "more than 50 percent total
clinical failure after chloroquin drugs were used on patients."
</P>
<P>
Since April, one of the worst highland malaria in recent years
broke out mainly in Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces, western
Kenya, leading to a death toll of 333 people.
</P>
<P>
Ouma noted that a possible cause of the high death toll was
resistance to chloroquin-based anti-malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted Davy Koech, director of the Kenya
Medical Research Institute, as saying that malaria is a curable
infection and the deaths could be as low as zero.
</P>
<P>
He warned that advertisements for chloroquin-based drugs may
be misleading, adding that these messages have made people go for
a product that is only going to suppress and not clear the
parasite.
</P>
<P>
Chloroquin resistance first emerged in Tanzania in the 1970's
after a mass chemo-therapy effort to eradicate the parasite using
chloroquin failed and certain parasites survived.
</P>
<P>
Highland malaria, which occurs mainly in areas at around 2,000
meters above sea level, is caused by the plasmodium falciparum
parasite transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito which thrives in
the wet and humid conditions of such areas after the March-May
long rains in the east African country.
