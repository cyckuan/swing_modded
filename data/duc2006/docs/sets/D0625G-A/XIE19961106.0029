The dispensing slots will be installed in bars, hotels and
lodging houses free of charge, the Kenya News Agency reported

way of fighting it is to avail condoms to the public.

sexually transmitted diseases among rural communities".

Participants were challenged to educate rural people on proper
usage of condoms because many cases are being reported in rural
areas, the report said.
