NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two people have died of
starvation in Fafi area of Garissa District in Kenya's North
Eastern Province in the past week, according to six members of
parliament from the province.
</P>
<P>
The six MPs, accompanied by 10 councilors from Garissa
District, pleaded Wednesday that the government and the donor
community send emergency relief food to the areas.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the parliament building in
Nairobi, the MPs asked the government to declare the province a
disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
Barre Shill, one of the six MPs, told the press that some
people in the area are dying of diarrhoea and "other diseases
related to lack of food and water."
</P>
<P>
They accused the Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu of
misleading the government by denying that people were dying from
starvation, saying there is a great famine in the province and
people are dying.
</P>
<P>
Those local leaders also noted that the famine situation in the
province was being aggravated by lack of medical supplies and poor
communication.
