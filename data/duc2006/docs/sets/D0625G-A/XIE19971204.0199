<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and diarrhoea have
killed more than 50 people in Mombasa and Malindi, Kenya's
coastal regions, since the epidemic started over one month ago,
the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 people from the area have been treated in various
hospitals for the diseases, Coast Provincial medical Officer of
Health S.K. Shariff was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cholera-related cases are still increasing because of the
contamination of drinking water following heavy rains in Mombasa,
he noted, appealing to all Coast residents to boil drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ongoing nurses' strike which has crippled
most public hospitals in the country since last Friday made the
situation more dangerous.
