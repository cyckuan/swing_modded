<HEADLINE> Kenya Bans Unhealthy Used Goods Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has declared
war against any unhealthy imported used goods in a bid to prevent
diseases spread and rescue local industries from collapse, the
People Daily newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Philip Okundi of the Kenya Bureau of
Standards said here Wednesday that with effect from October 1,
this year, imported used items which do not meet the requirements
of his organization would be banned.
</P>
<P>
Okundi was quoted as saying that the code of practice for the
importation of used shoes will require a health certificate from
the country of origin to certifying that they are free from any
skin disease or radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
The government also introduced a "fumigation certificate" on
used shoes, as the ban on the importation of used inner garments
became effective on June 30. Inner garments include under wears,
socks and vests.
</P>
<P>
It has established that the used items were causing diseases
ranging from leprosy, anthrax and other fungal diseases, Okundi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said following the order, already 60 trucks with unchecked
footwear had been netted and are being held at a depot.
