<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority Assails Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has accused the Israeli settlement policy of aiming to prevent the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state and isolating
Jerusalem from the West Bank through building new Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The PA made the accusation in a memorandum to be presented to
an emergency session of the Cairo-based Arab League due to start
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary meeting of the league's 22 permanent members,
called at the request of Syria and the PA, will discuss new
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue has underlined the trend of the policy
adopted by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, said the document.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more Jewish
settlements, complain that the Jewish settlements have broken up
the territories between their main cities and diminished their
chances of establishing an independent state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum reviewed the Israeli policy regarding Jerusalem,
settlements, confiscation of Palestinian lands, and pushing
Jewish immigrants in Jerusalem to the holy city of Judaize.
</P>
<P>
It also noted the fact that Israel has earmarked a huge budget
for the settlement policy, while leaving Jerusalem suffering from
deterioration in all utilities and services.
</P>
<P>
It shows that Israel has adopted an extremist policy against
the Palestinians and the Syrians in the occupied lands, the
memorandum concluded.
