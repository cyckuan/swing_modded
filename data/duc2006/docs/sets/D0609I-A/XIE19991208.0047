GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel confiscated 17,000 donums
(1,596.3 hectares) of Palestinian land in 1998 to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians
were killed in conflicts triggered by the expansion activities,
said an official report.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement activities also led to the destruction of
20,000 trees and 157 Palestinian houses, the withdrawal of the
identity cards of 420 Palestinian citizens living in Jerusalem,
said an annual report issued on Tuesday by the Palestinian
National Committee on Settlement Combat.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with
settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000
housing units early last July, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the
suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal
with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli
settlements.
