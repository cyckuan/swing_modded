	   EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday
that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West
Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement
and a violation of peace accords.
	   Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers
stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located
on a hilltop about 800 meters, or half a mile, from the trailer
park.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to
halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build
new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports
expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural
growth.''
	   The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement
usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing
settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves
in families to the new area.
	   Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank
land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. But
successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in
those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout
the West Bank.
	   Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the
beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David.
	   ``It's a new location and new settlers will be there. This is a
violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
	   Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the
trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense
ministry and would not remain in the area permanently. The trailers
were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated
in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
	   ``Every settlement begins with a trailer. They put up a trailer
and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,''
said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement,
which monitors settlement construction.
	   Noham Ochana, a youth counselor on the site, 15 youths live in
the trailers, which he said were brought in about six months ago by
a movement serving troubled teen-agers.
