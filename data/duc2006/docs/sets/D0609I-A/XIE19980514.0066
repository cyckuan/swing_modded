<HEADLINE> Israel Protests EU Boycott of Settlement Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
protested on Wednesday against the European Union's decision to
boycott settlement products from Israel by imposing heavy customs
duties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the EU decision
is "unfair" and would be "harmful" to reviving the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU on Wednesday decided to ask all its 15 members not to
exempt customs duties for products made by Israeli settlements in
the occupied territories. These include agricultural products,
processed foods, wines, flowers and others.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused that the EU's decision violated the trade
agreements signed with Israel, which give partial or complete
exemption from customs duties to Israeli products of these
categories.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that the occupied territories are not part of
Israel, and therefore the settlement products would be subjected
to heavy customs duties.
</P>
<P>
In April, EU threatened to imposed customs duties on products
from Israeli settlements. Israel was making diplomatic efforts to
block the EU move, which it regarded as a grave threat politically
rather than economically.
</P>
<P>
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. In Gaza alone the number is 19.
</P>
<P>
The settlements which encroach on ever-more Palestinian lands,
are armed enclave constantly guarded by Israeli soldiers who often
outnumbered the settlers themselves.
