<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Settlement Building Freeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today
authorized simpler procedure for granting permission for Jewish
constructions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to
ease the settlement building freeze imposed by the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session,
following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the
previous government of handicapping the natural developments of
Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on
Palestinian buildings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish
settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee
in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue
like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that any proposal to build new
settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be
that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no
operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the
settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the council also expressed its disappointment that
there has been no decision on actual developments and buildings
of the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member of Meretz,
Yossi Sarid said he had information on government plans for an
unprecedented settlement campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led
government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest
enemy of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice
to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead
to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would
lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.
