Preparations for more settlement construction under way

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit,
Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground
for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more
than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement. The
building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the
expansion of an existing one, the group said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States
and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to
accommodate natural population growth.
	   The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an
illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood
in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the
construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about
5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West
Bank. Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
	   Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first
stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would
depend on demand. ``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said,
noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv
metropolitan area. ``So far, everything that has been built has
been sold.''
	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an
expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse. He said that while the
construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of
Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
	   ``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and
purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.
