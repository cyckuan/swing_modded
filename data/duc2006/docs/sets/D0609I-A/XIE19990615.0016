<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Halt Construction of Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a U.N. conference on
Monday urged Israel to halt construction of Jewish settlements in
Palestinian areas and adhere to the peace agreements signed
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the opening session of the two-day fourth meeting
of the U.N. Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of
the Palestinian People criticized Israel's settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
"Building of new settlements and expansion of the existing ones
have destructive effects on the Mideast peace process," said
Seyyid al-Masri, Egypt's assistant foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The international community was surprised over Israel's
construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud
settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement,
al-Masri said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's activities have aroused fears over the devastating
consequences of its settlement policy on the peace process, he
added, calling on Israel to halt the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which always has ignored such discussions, did not
send a delegate to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials and delegates from member countries also started
preparations for a meeting in Geneva next month that could start a
process for dealing with Jewish settlements under international
laws.
</P>
<P>
That meeting, called by the U.N. General Assembly, is to urge
Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activities in the
Israeli-occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians maintain that construction of Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
violates the convention, which calls for protection for civilians
in wars. The convention bans usurpation of land by an occupying
power.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the meeting, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
called on the Palestinians and Israel to focus on building peace.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal for the political courage of the leaders on both sides
and call upon them to re-embark on the negotiations process in the
spirit of pragmatism and statesmanship," Annan said in the letter
read on his behalf by his deputy, Chinmaya Gharekhan.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive
peace talks largely due to Israel's settlement activities since
hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power
in 1996.
