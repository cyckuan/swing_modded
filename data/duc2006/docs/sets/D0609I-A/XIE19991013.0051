<HEADLINE> Palestinians Warn Against Continued Settlement </HEADLINE>

GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Tuesday repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish
settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final
status negotiations and destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Settlements will have a negative affect on the position of
Palestinian negotiators, it will destroy the peace process," said
Nabil Abourudeneh, advisor to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Abourudeneh made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah
after a meeting between Arafat and visiting Italian President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, during which the two leaders discussed the
latest development in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation
of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's
approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four
West Bank settlements this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has condemned the decision on several occasions. PNA
Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo went further by calling it
"crazy decisions."
</P>
<P>
Israel denied it was expanding settlements, saying all the new
housing units are within the borders of existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with
a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will
neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently aimed to appease the Palestinians, an
Israeli ministerial committee reviewing the settlement policy of
the former right-wing government met Sunday for the first time and
identified seven settlements as illegal.
</P>
<P>
The seven outposts were among the 42 settlements established
in the three years of the former Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated settlement activity in the last three years was
seen as an attempt by the settlers to grab as much as land before
Israel and the Palestinians entered the final status talks, in
which the thorniest issues including the fate of settlements will
be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians held a ceremony on September 13,
kicking off the long-overdue talks, but the Israeli side has yet
to name its negotiators.
