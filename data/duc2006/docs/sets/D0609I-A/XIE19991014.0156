<HEADLINE> Israel to Dismantle 12 Jewish Encampments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will begin from next
week to dismantle 12 Jewish encampments in the West Bank under an
agreement reached between the government and settler leaders, the
Prime Minister's Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, political and security advisor to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, met settler leaders here Wednesday night. The two
sides agreed to remove 12 hilltop outposts instead of 15 as
decided earlier by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 outposts, one will remain as pasture land and another
as a preparatory school through the end of the school year and
their future will then be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The settler leaders, who had opposed Barak's decision, said
they were satisfied with the results and promised that they would
help facilitate the evacuations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this issue, President Ezer Weizman said that the
dismantlement of the illegal encampments is necessary and the
result could help push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting Sunday of a ministerial committee
reviewing the policy on Jewish settlements under former right-wing
government, Barak informed Jewish settler leaders Tuesday that he
plans to dismantle 15 encampments illegally built in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak said his decision was based on the recommendations from
the defense establishment, which found that settlers have
established 42 encampments throughout the West Bank since the
signing of the Wye River peace accord last fall and their
legalities were all in question.
</P>
<P>
"I consider settlement activities in the West Bank, which was
always conducted at the behest and with the authorization of the
government, very important. But I think the law is of utmost
importance," Barak told the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip as illegal and demand that Israel evacuate all 144
settlements in these areas.
</P>
<P>
They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of
2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near
Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start
of the final status talks and destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel denied it was expanding Jewish settlements, saying that
the new housing units are all within the borders of existing
settlements.
</P>
<P>
One month after a ceremonial start, Israel has yet to name its
negotiators in the final status talks, in which the fate of the
Jewish settlements will be dealt with. The Palestinians accused
Israel of foot-dragging.
