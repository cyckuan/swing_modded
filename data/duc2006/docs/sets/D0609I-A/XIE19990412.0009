<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned About Israel's Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official Sunday
expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli
settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the
peace making between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near
Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk urged Israel to stop these activities
which "can affect and prejudge the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Indyk arrived in Israel earlier Sunday for talks to enhance
the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic
Cooperation, which was signed in October last year and designed
to improve Israel's defense and deterrence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and its principal ally in the Middle East
should remain coordinated in face of threats of ballistic
missiles and non-conventional weapons in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he said the strategic cooperation also has another aspect,
that is, to look for ways to move forward the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"The window of peacemaking is closed," he said, citing the
frozen agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and the
stalemate on the Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
He said "some questions have occurred" concerning the
U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, referring to the Jewish
settlement activities in the West Bank, "particularly in central
West Bank."
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, Washington has expressed its concern
on several occasions over Israel's land grabbing and settlement
expansion in the West Bank, saying it is a reversal of Israeli
assurance that such activity would not be carried out.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, both sides
should not take unilateral actions which will change the status
quo in Gaza and the West Bank before the talks on final status end.
</P>
<P>
Washington said unilateral actions include Jewish settlement
activity on the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the settlement
issue during talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in
Washington last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross bluntly
dismissed the settlement activity as "destructive" to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Indyk's remarks, Netanyahu repeated the
government's line that Israel has pledged not to build new
settlements but never promised to stop the expansion of existing
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Washington has, however, said that the accelerated Jewish
settlement activity in the recent months included construction of
new settlements as well as an expansion of settlements well beyond
their existing perimeters, in many cases involving expansions to
distant hilltops.
