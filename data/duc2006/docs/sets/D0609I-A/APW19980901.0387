Army asks Jewish settlements to fence themselves in
</HEADLINE>

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army has asked Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to build fences around their communities, a
proposal settler leaders rejected Tuesday as ineffective and an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The army's request came after several attacks on Jewish settlers
by Palestinian militants, including the shooting deaths of two
settlers outside the West Bank settlement of Itzhar last month.
	   The army said it sent the request to settlements that don't have
a security fence yet. Israel army radio said 21 of 144 settlements,
including Maaleh Adumim and Givat Zeev near Jerusalem, were asked
to build fences.
	   Settler leaders said fences were ineffective and would create a
siege atmosphere. ``They (the army) should close off the
(Palestinian) villages since the attacks come from them,'' said
Yehudit Tayar, spokeswoman of the Jewish Settlers Council.
	   Benny Kashriel, mayor of Maaleh Adumim, said he would not meet
the army's request because it would send the wrong message to
residents. ``In Tel Aviv and Jerusalem there were also attacks but
does that mean we should fence in the city centers,'' he said.
	   Settlers also oppose such boundaries since they might be an
obstacle to future expansion.
	   The Peace Now group, which advocates the creation of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, said the settlers'
refusal to build fences showed that their opposition to a
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians was not based on security
concerns, as they claim.
	   ``Peace Now calls on the government to evacuate each settlement
that refuses to be enclosed by a fence,'' Peace Now said.
