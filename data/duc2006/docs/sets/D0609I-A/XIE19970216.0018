<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls on Israel to Halt Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged Israel to
cease settlement construction and refrain from actions against
Arab residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a tour to the West Bank city of Jenin, Arafat
said that Israel should abide by the interim agreement it has
signed and not attempt to alter it.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Israel's moves of continuing the building of
settlements in the territories including East Jerusalem, and
canceling state of permanent residents for Arabs living in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said that "the Palestinians were
stronger than the settlements and stronger than the settlers." He
added the PNA leadership had decided to conduct dialog with the
opposition of the Israeli government in its struggle against the
expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's call came a day ahead of the resumption of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks on further implementing the interim
agreement. The talks signaled the continuation of the peace
process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank
city of Hebron last month.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the talks was agreed in the summit held last
Sunday between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Eight joint panels will start negotiations Sunday to discuss
economic and security issues related to the interim agreement,
including the opening of safe passages between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, the construction of an airport and sea port in Gaza,
and the development of economic and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiating team will be headed by Foreign
Minister David Levy and the Palestinian one by Arafat's deputy
Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Arafat convened a joint meeting of the
Palestinian Council and PLO Executive Committee in the West Bank
city of Jericho. The meeting condemned Israel for failing to
respond to the messages issued by the council on the settlement
issue, and called on Palestinians to continue fighting against
the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership also adopted a resolution to grant
health, housing and financial assistance to the 30 Palestinian
women detainees released by Israel earlier this week.
