West Bank settlement gets city status

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face
of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish
West Bank settlement of Ariel.
	   Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up an attempt to try to move
Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward agreement over a
long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
	   Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18
miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated
Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city
from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
	   Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit
to Ariel was arranged. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan,
could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy
accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a
message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
	   Ariel was established in 1977. Nachman said raising the status
of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means
permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
	   For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles
to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians denounce
the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
	   Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with
the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel
while the ceremony is in progress.
	   A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in
Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is
trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
