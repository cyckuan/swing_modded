<HEADLINE> US Expresses Concerns Over Israel's Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today expressed concerns over a new Israeli plan to expand the
existing Jewish settlement on the West Bank and near Jerusalem,
indicating such a move will further erode confidence between the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During a photo session with Norway's Foreign Minister Bjoern
Tore Godfal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
that she raised the issue during a meeting Thursday with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very delicate moment in the whole situation, where it's
very important to do everything we can to rebuild the bonds of
confidence. Within that context, I expressed my concern to
Minister Mordechai about the thickening of the settlement," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai announced this week that there is a plan to add 358
housing units to the West Bank settlements of Jenin and Sharei
Tikva and several thousand near Jerusalem. And he told a Jewish
group in Washington today that the existing settlements "must be
able to develop and grow."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has opposed construction of new
settlements as complicating to territorial negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians, but said expansion of existing ones
wasn't a problem as long as it was a product of "natural growth."
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Clinton administration expressed "concerns"
as it is at a sensitive time.
