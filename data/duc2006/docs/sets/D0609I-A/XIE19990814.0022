<HEADLINE> Peace Activists Scuffle with Jewish Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace
Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they
toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they
called illegal settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
The activists and settlers pushed and sometimes threw punches
at each other on the hilltop about three miles from the
settlement of Itamar in central West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The visitors called the outposts set up by the settlers
illegal, but a spokesman for the settlers said the camps were
within the range of Itamar and called the tour of the activists
provocative.
</P>
<P>
The tour was cut short at a nearby settlement of Berakha,
where Israeli soldiers barred the activists from entering,
declaring it a closed military zone.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing legislator Uzi Landau from the Likud party called
on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ban similar "provocative visits"
by members of Peace Now, a watchdog monitoring settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office early last month, Barak has pledged to
move forward the peace process stalled under the three years
of rule by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu. But he
has been at odds with the Palestinians over Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have urged Barak to dismantle all the
settlements, calling them illegal and inconsistent with peace
accords signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to halt building of new settlements, but
vowed not to remove existing ones before Israel and the
Palestinians enter the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The ex-army chief has said that large blocs of Jewish
settlements would remain under Israeli control after a permanent
peace accord was reached as a result of the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Peace Now said that Jewish settlements
are expanding under Barak's government at a faster pace than
under the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
The group said in the month since Barak took office, the
Housing Ministry has issued tenders for the construction of 1,517
apartments in the settlements, six times the average monthly rate
of house construction in the settlements under the former
government.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Ministry said the figures were incorrect and
tenders had been issued for only 678 new homes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 150
settlements which scattered in the West Bank and Gaza, dividing
the areas into many isolated parts.
