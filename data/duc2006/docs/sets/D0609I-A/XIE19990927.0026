<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Group Opposes Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing
construction tenders for settlement expansion in the
Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the
peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli
peace group here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry
has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish
settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this
action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks
</P>
<P>
The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the
total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous
government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
</P>
<P>
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his
objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the
new tenders.
</P>
<P>
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the
National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued
under the government's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders
were issued after the new government came to power in July and
1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest
settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
</P>
<P>
Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement.
</P>
<P>
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of
the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during
their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the
settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United
Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the
settlement expansions in the territories.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in
Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement
on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he will
continue to expand it.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such
remarks. Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge
of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh
Adumim is evacuation."
</P>
<P>
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian
cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to
situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
