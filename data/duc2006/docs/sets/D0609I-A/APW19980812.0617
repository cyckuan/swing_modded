Peace group: close to 6,000 houses being built in West Bank, Gaza

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Nearly 6,000 new houses and apartments are
under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, while close to 3,000 are standing empty, a peace group said
Wednesday.
	   The Israeli government authorized the construction despite the
United States' call for a freeze in settlement expansion.
	   Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's
settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units
under construction. They also found 2,888 fully built housing units
standing empty.
	   There are currently 42,000 housing units in the West Bank and
Gaza, Peace Now leader Mosi Raz said. The new building will
increase the number of units by 15 percent, he said.
	   Last year, Peace Now counted 5,200 houses under construction.
	   ``These counts prove, for the umpteenth time, that this
government is pro-settlements, that building is steadily increasing
and that there is no thought to the consequences,'' Raz said at a
news conference.
	   Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians charge that expansion of the
settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace
settlement.
	   Peace Now teams visited every settlement save two. They were
prevented from entering the Itamar settlement by residents who
confronted them at the gate, blocking their way in. One settler was
detained on suspicion of striking a press photographer traveling
with the group.
	   The survey teams chose not to enter the settlement of Itzhar,
where residents are still in mourning following the murder of two
settlers there last week. Israeli troops detained two Palestinians
from a nearby village in connection to the killings on Tuesday.
	   Israel's Housing Ministry claimed that only 220 of the units
under construction were government-funded. Any other building was
private, ministry advisor Moshe Eilat said.
	   However that statement was refuted by both Peace Now and
Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, who both said that close to
two-thirds of all housing units in the West Bank and Gaza were
publicly funded.
	   All building in the settlements, public or private, must be
approved by the Defense Ministry before it can go ahead.
	   Statistics Bureau figures from April _ the most recent month
available _ reported 3,410 units under construction, of which 2,290
were public. The Bureau's figures are based on reports provided by
the settlements themselves and on estimates based on statistical
models.
