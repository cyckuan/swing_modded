<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Have Serious Differences on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Serious differences arose
between Jordan and Israel over a planned expansion of Jewish
settlement in the West Bank, Jordanian Information Minister
Marwan Muasher has said.
</P>
<P>
"I've clarified the Jordanian position regarding the
settlements and stressed that this constitutes a threat to the
peace process," said Muasher Friday when concluding a four-day
visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There are big differences between the Jordanian and Israeli
perspectives on the issue of settlements," Muasher said after
his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu in
West Jerusalem, according to Jordan radio.
</P>
<P>
Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government decision
Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a move that could
entice more Israelis to settle in the occupied area.
</P>
<P>
The decision would likely boost construction and investment in
the 144 Jewish settlements. The Palestinians sharply opposed the
settlement expansion and warned that it would lead to the collapse
of the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Muasher told Israel TV Thursday that Jordan was committed to
working with Israel "to protect the achievements" of peace, but
warned that Netanyahu's policies were endangering them.
</P>
<P>
Muasher, who was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel
following the kingdom's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish
state, cited the settlement expansion plans and the delays in
implementing the Israeli-Palestinian accords in particular.
</P>
<P>
He said Friday that the construction of new settlements
in Ras Al Amud area in Jerusalem and the Israeli cabinet
decision to provide additional facilities to the settlement
activity posed a threat to the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said that during his meetings with Israeli officials,
he stressed Jordan's keen interest and desire to work with all
peace-loving forces to push the peace process forward, and to
block all attempts to abort the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime
minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government remains committed in the peace
process with the Palestinians and respects the peace treaty
signed with Jordan," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is conscious of Jordan's needs for stability and
prosperity," Netanyahu told Muasher, according to the statement.
