<HEADLINE> Israel Issues Settlement Expansion Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Housing and
Construction Ministry has issued 2,600 new tenders for house
constructions in the settlements of the West Bank, Israel Radio
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All those tenders were issued after the new government came to
power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim,
and others for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the
Radio quoted ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ma'aleh Adumim is the largest settlement situated just east of
Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers. It is called city instead of
settlement now.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are one of
the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestinians
during their final-status talks which have been launched September
13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the
settlement expansions pending a final solution to this
issue. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in his U.N. address on
Wednesday has asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement
expansions in the territories.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in
Ma'aleh Adumim, no matter what happens in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement
on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he would, like
the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, continue to expand it.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem,"
which has triggered sharp criticism from the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs,
said that the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is
"evacuation."
</P>
<P>
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian
cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to
situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
