	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A high school is scrapping celebrations  
of Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, worried that the ethnic 
celebrations will spark ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Inglewood High School, 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles,  
has been the site of tensions between black and Hispanic students. 
The campus was forced to close for a day last May after a riot 
broke out and dozens of police were called in. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force found that the fight in May began, in part, because  
Hispanic students who comprise about half the school population 
felt slighted. They were angry that a month was set aside to honor 
black history but only a day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of celebrating Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo,  
Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers to follow a 
``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's talk about all cultures and contributions all the  
time,'' Winston said. ``This school has had racial problems that 
are unique ... the old ways didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February is marked by many schools around the country as Black  
History Month. May 5 is a national holiday in Mexico commemorating 
an 1862 battle in which Mexico defeated French occupation troops 
southeast of Mexico City.
