<HEADLINE> Safety Plans Didn't Stop Ga. Attack </HEADLINE>

	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Borland came home from a business trip  
last month to find his 18-year-old son, Graham, gripped by news of 
carnage at a high school in Littleton, Colo. ``You know, this could 
happen in our school system,'' the teen-ager recalls warning his 
dad. ``We need to take more precautions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Borland agreed. As a school board member for Rockdale  
County, he was in a good position to respond. Safety measures 
already were in place, and administrators quickly reinforced them. 
</P>
<P>
	But that couldn't stop a 15-year-old from opening fire Thursday,  
wounding six students and adding Heritage High School to the list 
of campus bloodbaths that have shocked and frustrated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting in Rockdale County, a semirural setting of 68,000  
mostly white, comfortable and churchgoing inhabitants, 25 miles 
east of Atlanta, suggests that even an elaborate safety system may 
not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Under measures adopted a few years ago, Rockdale schools already  
employed armed police during school hours, according to schools 
spokeswoman Susan Paul Smith. Video cameras already watched kids on 
school buses and in the schools. Trained dogs periodically came to 
sniff for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, when Thomas Solomon Jr., the youth now  
charged in the shooting, reportedly brought a gun to school, the 
allegations were followed up and recorded, though they could never 
be substantiated, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	After two teen-agers at Columbine High killed a teacher, 12  
students and themselves, security measures in Rockdale, where 
Conyers is the county seat, were reviewed. Teachers got a list of 
steps to take, like keeping rooms secure in an emergency, and 
taking the attendance roll. Superintendent Don Peccia sent parents 
a letter promising investigations and a police response to any 
``rumors, threats or allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Strict disciplinary consequences will be assigned to any  
student and to anyone else exhibiting such behavior,'' Peccia 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Children were encouraged to help.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids were told, `Anything that doesn't seem right, speak  
up,''' said Mary Kommeth, an English teacher at Salem, one of three 
Rockdale high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Borland, the school board member's son, said that one  
schoolmate who had often boasted about ``blowing up graduation'' 
was followed constantly by staff members, and never allowed to be 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's father, a leasing company executive, heads a committee  
to review safety in the school district, which serves more than 
13,000 children including preschoolers. The panel includes about 35 
parents, business people, members of law enforcement, and even an 
FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloodshed at Heritage High School could have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	The shooter used a rifle that was missing its stock and shot  
from the hip, said Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington. That may 
explain why the gun was aimed downward, lessening the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also used the word 'blessed' many times,'' Borland said  
after a school board meeting Thursday, the day of the shooting. ``I 
think we were very thankful to God. I think he was looking out for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among parents gathering for the meeting, which had been  
scheduled before the shooting took place, there was a hint of 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that you could prevent it 100 percent,'' said  
Paul Lee, a Conyers father of two teen-agers. ``They have 
terrorists all over the world. In the Capitol, that guy broke in 
and killed two guards,'' he said, referring to last July's killings 
in Washington. ``It could happen anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borland and others say they had striven until now to strike a  
balance between adequate security and not turning the schools into 
fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now school officials are talking about mandating clear book  
bags, or no bookbags, a dress code, even metal detectors -- ideas 
that until now had been soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's group will be reviewing the schools' inch-thick crisis  
management book. One situation the book doesn't deal with, Borland 
said, is what to do when a student has a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change too.
