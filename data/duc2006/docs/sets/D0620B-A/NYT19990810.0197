U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY SAYS VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS LESS LIKELY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As schools reopen for the new academic year, U.S.
Education Secretary Richard Riley offered this reassurance Tuesday:
Parents and students should not fear repeats of deadly gun rampages
such as the one last April in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said school efforts to counter violence are paying off and
students are getting the message that guns have no place in school.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a new Education Department report showing that a total
of 3,390 students were expelled for bringing firearms to school
during the 1997-1998 school year, the most recent year available.
The number was 31 percent lower than the previous school year, when
5,724 students were expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sharp decline ... tells us that we are starting to move in
the right direction,'' Riley said. ``All of us _ parents,
educators, students and all citizens _ can look to this new school
year with hope, not with fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Modzeleski, director of the department's safe and drug-free
schools program, said statistics for the 1998-1999 school year just
completed are not yet available because of a lag time in reporting
from local school districts and state education agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of all homicides among school-age children
occur in or around schools, Riley said. Nevertheless, surveys have
shown a level of anxiety among parents and students over school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One such survey of high-school age students released Tuesday by
the Horatio Alger Association showed 37 percent feel safe in
school, down from 44 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But local school security officials meeting with Riley said they
believed schools generally are safe places, and that incidents such
as the one at Columbine High School are ``an aberration,'' as
Wesley Mitchell, police chief of the Los Angeles Unified School
District, put it.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident last April, two students stormed into Columbine
and killed a dozen classmates and a teacher before committing
suicide. Other similar incidents have occurred in Pearl, Miss.,
West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that while educators and law enforcement
officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers
and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future
random attack is extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the point of attack, very few of the measures we could
have, or do have, in place probably would have prevented the
Columbine incident,'' said Edward Ray, director of security for
Denver public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we identify those young people ... `red flag' students
that seem to be heading in (a violent) direction. It's a very
complex issue. It's not something that can be readily identified at
the school level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that incidents such as Columbine are ``beyond
predictability,'' adding: ``Our number one goal is to make our
schools as safe as we possibly can without turning them into
bunkers. I don't think any of us in this country want to see our
schools become institutions surrounded by concrete walls and
concertina wire.''
</P>
<P>
   The education department report released Tuesday showed:
</P>
<P>
   _ The majority of those expelled in the 1997-98 school year _ 62
percent _ were expelled for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven percent were for possession of rifles or shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ The remaining 31 percent were for other types of weapons such
as bombs or grenades.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-seven percent of those expelled were high school
students, while 33 percent were in junior high school and 10
percent in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, larger states reported higher numbers of
expulsions. California, with a school-age population of 6.2
million, had 382 expulsions. New York, with 3.2 million school-age
children, had 91 expulsions. Texas, with 3.9 million children,
expelled 424 _ the highest state total.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions are the result of the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act,
which conditioned federal education dollars on states passing laws
that require local school districts to expel. All states have
adopted such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Riley said, the Education Department
will release $135 million in grants to help schools and communities
prevent violence through drug and alcohol counseling, and programs
to help young people find ways of resolving problems without
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Marquis, chief of police at the Houston Independent School
District, said authorities have gotten smarter about making it
harder for youths to carry guns in school. Among the anti-gun
measures are controls on backpacks and a dress code that makes it
difficult for students to hide guns in clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, however, information (on students with guns) comes
from other students,'' Marquis said. ``These are all signs ... So
when we say the numbers are down, we have good indicators.''

   Riley spoke at a press conference here just hours before a
gunman opened fire in a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles,
wounding five persons including three children. While that incident
did not conform to the pattern of students taking out their
frustrations with guns aimed at fellow students, it raised new
concerns about levels of random violence and the ability of
authorities to guard against unpredictable outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Riley referred to the particularly gruesome round of
blood-letting in Atlanta last month in which securities day-trader
Mark O. Barton killed 12 people including his wife and two children
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta episode and the wave of school shootings serve to
remind ``once again that this country really has created a culture
of violence with this easy access to guns,'' Riley said.
``Americans really need to stop and think hard about what's
happening.''
