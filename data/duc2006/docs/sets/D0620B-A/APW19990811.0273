	MCKEE, Ky. (AP) -- Students returning to classes at Jackson  
County High School hardly paid attention to the new small plaques 
mounted in their classrooms. Maybe the new dress code was on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials in this eastern Kentucky school district hope that  
by posting the Ten Commandments in each classroom, they can prevent 
violence and other problems that have plagued schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The county school board and superintendent allowed the plaques  
as part of ``an effort to start having good morals in school ... 
because of all the violent issues that have been showing up,'' said 
Betty Bond, principal of the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaques went up Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Schools around the country have considered using the Ten  
Commandments as a symbol of morality amid headline-grabbing 
violence involving students over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that organized prayer  
and Bible readings were not permitted in public schools; in 1980, 
it decided posting the Ten Commandments violated the Constitution's 
ban of government-established religion. 
</P>
<P>
	But in June, the U.S. House passed a measure allowing the Ten  
Commandments to be posted in schools and other government 
buildings. The bill now goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Crawford, Jackson County's school district attorney,  
said he is concerned about lawsuits, but believes the plaques in 
the district's five schools are allowed by law because they were 
paid for and posted by local volunteers and not sponsored by the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe posting the Ten Commandments is imposing  
anyone's religious views because the kids are not tested on that, 
the kids are not required to look at it, and the kids are not 
required to read it, and they're not held accountable for that 
knowledge,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Adams, principal of Union Chapel Elementary School in  
Russell County, which has had the Ten Commandments posted for 
years, said she's never received any complaints about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our community would probably be upset if they were  
taken away,'' Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Adams County, Ohio, a group of ministers paid to place Ten  
Commandments tablets outside four high schools to counter ``moral 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Vessels, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Kentucky, said the ACLU considers the move 
unconstitutional, but would not act unless there is a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ACLU is certainly very concerned about school violence,  
but saying posting the Ten Commandments solves it is incredibly 
simplistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Hughes, spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards  
Association, said the organization tells districts to follow the 
Supreme Court ruling and not allow the Ten Commandments to be 
posted. He said a lawsuit could cost a district up to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	There was virtually no opposition from the community about the  
plaques, and students returning to the high school said little 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a new dress code this year, and I suspect in the  
children's mind that's much more of a trauma than the Ten 
Commandments being placed up because this is a very traditional 
community and really church-oriented,'' Bond said.
