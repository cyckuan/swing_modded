<HEADLINE> School Gets Vivid Lesson on Safety  </HEADLINE>

	   FORT GIBSON, Okla. (AP) -- The teen-ager standing on stage in short sleeves
and jeans looked like he had nothing to hide -- until he pulled a knife from his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   And then came a machete. And another. He drew a handgun from a front pocket,
and three more from his waistband. He reached down his baggy pants leg and up
came a rifle.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Chris Dorn's pockets were empty, an arsenal lay before the high
school sophomore. And the audience of school, police and emergency officials had
a better idea of what they face in their efforts to keeping schools safe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He can double the number of weapons just with a jacket on,'' Michael Dorn,
school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school
security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 people came to learn about school safety in the town where in
December, a 13-year-old boy shot four students outside Fort Gibson Middle
School.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the country's third school shooting of the year. In May, a
15-year-old boy in Conyers, Ga., wounded six students. And in April, two
students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., shot 12 students and a
teacher to death, before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   A national study found more than 100,000 students carry a gun to school each
day, but only 4,000 student gun expulsions were reported to the U.S. Department
of Education last year, Dorn said.
</P>
<P>
	   While schools cannot ensure safety, they can enact strategies that make
schools safer, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorn, who works for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said enforcing
dress codes and reducing ``triggering behaviors'' such as fights and bullying
can help make a difference. Schools also have used random locker inspections and
surprise classroom searches to foil potential acts of violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also discussed creating emergency plans for schools that would include
everyone, from the local police to the school bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fort Gibson already had a crisis plan when the December attack took place.
The district has since started using a metal detector at special events, added
security cameras and limited building access, Superintendent Steve Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just being mentally prepared can help,'' Wilmoth said.
