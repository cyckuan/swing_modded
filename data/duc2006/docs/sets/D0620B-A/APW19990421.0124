<HEADLINE> Experts Consider School Security </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could it happen here? That was a question many  
principals and superintendents asked last year after a spate of 
school shootings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	So they increased security, bought metal detectors and  
surveillance cameras, created profiles of potentially violent 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	But as another school shooting tragedy unfolded in Littleton,  
Colo., on Tuesday, officials questioned whether any school could 
protect against such deadly events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a  
student who is going to act out?'' said Barbara Wheeler, school 
board member in Downers Grove, Ill., and former president of the 
National School Boards Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools, adopting an attitude that it's better to be safe  
than sorry, have responded to the slightest sign of troubled 
students: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A high school student in Starkville, Miss., was arrested in  
February and faces criminal charges for having a gun on school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa., who had a gun and  
repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High 
School after a fellow student told his mother of threats. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A ninth-grade girl in Fairfax County, Va., was suspended when  
she wrote a note to a fellow student expressing anger about her 
teacher giving her a D, and the teacher took it as a physical 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	William Modzeleski, the Education Department's safe schools  
chief, said schools have used federal and state money to identify 
and treat students who need mental health services. Schools have 
also gotten more federal money in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months ago President Clinton held a White House conference  
on school violence with about 800 educators and law-enforcement 
officials. But Tuesday night, he acknowledged the nation had made 
little progress in solving the violence problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are a lot of kids out there who ... who build  
up these grievances in their own mind and who are not being 
reached,'' Clinton said. ``And it's not just Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the federal Safe and Drug Free Schools program -- now funded  
at $600 million a year -- began five years ago, it focused on 
student drug abuse. But in recent years, the focus has shifted to 
school security. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials still say schools are safe. In 1996, theft  
accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that schools are terribly  
crime-ridden. The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools  
that seem safe to teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., opened fire  
on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four 
classmates and a teacher. Students also were accused of fatal 
shootings in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was  
accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not  
preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating 
students' rights when imposing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of  
the threat of lawsuits, Modzeleski said. They have been working 
with attorneys to develop fair policies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High  
School in the middle-class suburb of Littleton, where gunmen -- 
believed to be fellow students -- opened fire Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education  
Association, said the state's 176 districts set their own policies.
