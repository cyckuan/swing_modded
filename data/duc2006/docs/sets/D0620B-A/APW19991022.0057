	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- New software that helps highlight school  
trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes 
such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is  
designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track 
incidents of school violence and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,''  
president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the 
company's Greensboro headquarters. ``And they need to have 
information available to them quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the appropriate data is entered, the program helps users  
identify potential problems and repeat offenders. It tracks 
incidents by category, including offender, victim, weapons and 
location. The analysis capability is similar to that in several 
existing business and financial programs -- not surprising since GBA 
Systems' main focus is selling accounting and other business 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County  
school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school 
principal asked him to help identify places in the school where 
crime was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal thought the biggest problems were in the gym and  
cafeteria. But after using the GBA software, Bateman found the hot 
spots were in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal used the information to justify shifting more  
resources to those areas, knowing that his decision was based on 
valid statistics instead of a hunch, or a quick reaction to one or 
two incidents,'' Bateman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While school safety measures such as metal detectors or  
additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the 
cost of the software to be less than $2 per student. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are  
using the software as part of their security programs, according to 
GBA Systems. And others, including the New York City school 
district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the 
problem of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting  
of campus crime would help administrators get a better 
understanding of the problems they face and allow for early 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we have encouraged for several years,'' said  
June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety 
Center in Westlake Village, Calif. ``You cannot deploy resource 
officers to a particular school until you can see the problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe  
Schools in Berkley Springs, W. Va., also saw merit in the 
software's ability to spot potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A report issued by the National Association of School  
Psychologists before Columbine concluded there was a common warning 
sign in five separate school shooting incidents. Students who were 
isolated or withdrawn were prone to being picked on by other 
students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bullying was a common factor in all five cases and also  
at Columbine,'' he said. ``It should not be used as the basis for 
expulsion, but it can be used in determining if someone needs 
additional help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blauvelt said schools need to be careful however about possibly  
violating a student's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fine line,'' he said. ``Just because someone is  
withdrawn does not mean they are violent, but the student needs 
help to become reattached with the school community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' Ms. Stone is quick to point out the software is not  
a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can provide a tool -- and quite a simple tool -- to help  
schools make better informed decisions, then our goal is 
accomplished,'' she said.
