<HEADLINE> Columbine District Adds Security </HEADLINE>

	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The school board that governs Columbine  
High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic 
alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high 
school students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The only recommendation by the Jefferson County school  
district's Safety Task Force that was rejected, because of cost, 
was the addition of a second non-uniformed campus supervisor at 
each of the 16 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools  
now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a police 
officer or sheriff's deputy. All will have one under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students will return to their school on Aug. 16 for  
the first time since the April 20 massacre. Columbine seniors Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with guns and pipe bombs, 
killed 12 students and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then took 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Other measures adopted Monday include: requiring visitors to get  
a school pass, the continued use of search dogs and the 
installation of a hot line and tip box to report incidents that 
might lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some task force members asked whether the measures would have  
stopped the shooting rampage had they been in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found all of our recommendations can create some kind of  
safety in the schools. I think some of these recommendations could 
have prevented what happened,'' said task force member and 
Columbine student Sergie Gonzalez.
