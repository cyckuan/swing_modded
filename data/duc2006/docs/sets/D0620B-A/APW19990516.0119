	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- City schools closed last week after the  
arrest of four students who allegedly planned a massacre similar to 
Colorado's Columbine High School slayings will reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police will be posted inside Holland Woods Middle School. A bomb  
was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials 
and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four 
students at the school. Police have said the bomb is unrelated to 
the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the district's 21 schools were closed Friday, then  
searched over the weekend and found to be safe, superintendent Bill 
Kimball said Sunday. Security will also be tightened district-wide 
on Monday, and teachers will discuss school safety with students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking every measure possible to be sure our kids are  
safe,'' Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents were uncomfortable with the decision to reopen the  
schools in this city about 60 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they should just end the school year and have  
that extra three weeks to figure out what they're going to do to 
safeguard our kids for next year,'' said Heidy Martindale, the 
mother of a 12-year-old girl at Holland Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	She said parents were told at a meeting Thursday night that  
Holland Woods was safe. Within hours, a custodian found the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney Fontenot, 12, a sixth grader at Holland Woods, cried  
when she heard that school would be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel uncomfortable going to that school,'' Whitney said.  
</P>
<P>
	Four Holland Woods students ages 12 to 14 remain jailed after  
being charged on Thursday with conspiracy to commit murder at the 
560-student school. 
</P>
<P>
	The two 14-year-olds, Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, have  
been charged as adults and are being held on $100,000 bond each. 
The younger students are to appear Tuesday in St. Clair County 
Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
	All were arrested last week after a 14-year-old girl told police  
she overheard some of them talking about an elaborate school 
killing spree. The girl told police the boys said their plan was to 
go on a shooting spree in a gym assembly and detonate a bomb 
afterward, acts aimed at killing the school's ``preps,'' the 
popular clique of students. 
</P>
<P>
	Again Sunday, police and school district officials declined to  
comment on evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the teens planned to top the death toll of  
the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 
where teenage gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 before 
committing suicide.
