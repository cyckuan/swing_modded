   NEW YORK _ The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., have led school officials in the New York City metropolitan
area to reassess security and in some cases to make changes to
minimize threats.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme is West Hartford, Conn., where administrators
devised what they termed a ``lockdown'' drill in which students and
teachers, practicing in case there should be a shooting, lock all
doors and stay put until they are told that the police have
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But a more common reaction is that of New York City, where the
Police Department obtained blueprints of the 1,100 schools and
asked precinct commanders to work with principals and
superintendents on how to handle such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the potential for violence at schools has weighed
heavily on many administrators and has generated forums for public
discussion in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been
spared school shootings but not the heightened alarm.
</P>
<P>
   There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April
20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents
were reported. Shootings at New York City schools are rare; there
has not been a fatal one since February 1992, when two teenagers
involved in a feud over a gold bracelet were shot dead in the
hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn just moments
before Mayor David Dinkins was to arrive for a speech, said Karen
Crowe, a spokeswoman for the board. That shooting led to the
widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Columbine, New York state officials are requiring
districts to report major violent acts _ bomb threats, explosions,
shootings _ to the state Department of Education within 48 hours of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation is designed to better track violence and help
raise awareness among school officials and the communities they
serve to the potential for violence, said Christopher Carpenter, a
spokesman for the department. He said school officials who failed
to comply could face disciplinary action by the state, which
licenses principals and superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a task force headed by Lt. Gov. Mary Donahue
has held public hearings across the state _ the final one was on
Wednesday _ to prepare a report for Gov. George Pataki on improving
school safety.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, New Jersey state officials convened public forums to
gather information toward a similar goal, and local districts in
Connecticut must report to Gov. John Rowland by September on how
they have improved security.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who work in schools are taking no chances. A
conference on Monday sponsored by the Connecticut Association of
Schools and Connecticut Center for School Change at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden included agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation instructing teachers on how to be good hostages. It
drew 225 people, the association's largest audience in four years.
