   ATLANTA _ At rural schoolhouses and sprawling urban campuses
across the country, millions of students returning to class in the
next few weeks will encounter a steely array of new security
measures. In many schools, lockers are being removed, cameras are
being installed as hallway monitors, and students will have to
swipe a computerized ID card just to get in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Even as new statistics show that school violence is actually on
the decline, the lurid images from armed assaults by students this
year have prompted most school districts to take some kind of
forceful action to instill a sense of greater security. That
inclination can only be strengthened by the shooting at a Jewish
community center in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts are forging close new relationships with local
police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school
grounds. In dozens of locales as disparate as Pittsburgh and Palm
Beach County, Fla., SWAT teams have spent the summer learning the
layouts of high schools and conducting drills involving mock
hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning
to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at
the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas
backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to
conceal a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts, by contrast, have rejected the idea of detection
systems, finding them an affront to educational openness, and are
concentrating instead on a drumbeat of programs to make students
feel more responsible for their school's safety and less reluctant
to report violations.
</P>
<P>
   The new policies vary widely, but virtually all are a direct
reaction to the shootings this spring at high schools in Littleton,
Colo., and here in Georgia, in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers. Many
administrators who say they have never received a threat of bombing
or gunfire have nonetheless felt obliged to reassure parents and
students that steps have been taken to reduce the chances that
their school is the next to be encircled by news helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone feels the need to do something, even though no one
agrees on what that should be,'' said Joe Schneider, deputy
executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators, which represents superintendents. ``You can't just
tell parents that you're doing more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications, however, that security measures and
counseling programs gradually undertaken before the shootings this
spring have proved increasingly effective. In a report issued this
week, the U.S. Department of Education, having compiled statistics
from each of the states, found that gun-related expulsions in the
last school year dropped by nearly a third from the previous year.
Another study, issued last week by researchers at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, determined that violence committed
by teen-agers had declined during the 1990s, along with the number
of weapons carried to school.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators know that such studies are of little comfort
to parents who have learned that violence can erupt anywhere, at
any moment. Indeed, taken as a whole the new policies seem intended
as much to instill peace of mind as to actually keep a student from
opening fire on his school, prevention of which many officials say
is probably impossible in any case. A doorway metal detector, for
example, can do little to forestall a blaze of gunfire in the
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that districts are taking these steps solely to
reassure people, but there's often as much reassurance built into
them as actual effectiveness,'' said Dennis Lewis, director of
school public safety in Springfield, Mo., and vice president of the
National Association of School Safety and Law Enforcement Officers.
``Parents will call up and ask if a school has metal detectors. All
of us know that no metal detector is going to stop someone who
wants to shoot in a school. But a parent wants to hear that they're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many districts conducted highly publicized drills over the
summer in which police SWAT teams entered schools to put down mock
shootings. Last month in Palm Beach County, Fla., for example,
drama students with fake wounds pretended to be casualties as
officers stormed a school and ``arrested'' police academy recruits
who were pretending to take hostages and plant bombs, all under the
gaze of television cameras. A similar drill at a Pittsburgh high
school on Wednesday, complete with helicopters and ersatz pipe
bombs, was so realistic that some summer students believed that
police were responding to an actual attack. The exercises provided
useful training to police in the unfamiliar territory of a school
building, while also sending a message of control to parents and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, of the superintendents' group, said the shaping of a
new relationship with the local police department was probably the
most common step adopted by the nation's school districts. After it
became known that the Littleton Police Department had been
unfamiliar with the layout of Columbine High School, where 12
students and a teacher were killed by two young gunmen on April 20,
many districts began distributing floor plans and computerized
blueprints of their schools to their police departments, which in
turn began touring the schools over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive districts are erecting virtual walls around
their schools, as if trying to keep the outside world at bay. In
Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas that cut back its class schedule
last spring after a series of bomb threats, officials are spending
$1 million to bring in metal detectors, surveillance cameras and a
new security force, and are requiring students to wear
identification badges. In Deltona, Fla., near Orlando, lockers have
been removed and book bags banned; students will get a duplicate
set of books to keep at home. Many schools are installing caller ID
on their telephones so they can trace bomb threats.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In Owensboro, Ky., all but the front doors of public schools
have been permanently locked, and visitors and latecomers must be
buzzed in with a new security system that alerts the office
whenever anyone approaches the door. Video cameras are being
installed on school buses in Clayton County, Ga., southeast of
Atlanta. Columbine High School itself will install emergency alarms
throughout the building, and will be employing dogs to search for
weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such measures consider them effective deterrents,
a tangible reflection of a school's insistence on safety. John
Coleman, director of safety and security for the public schools of
Kansas City, Mo., said his district had not had a single shooting
or knifing since it installed metal detectors in middle and high
schools seven years ago. Similar results are reported in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the fortress approach to security is hardly
universal. Methods of security tend to vary as broadly as parenting
techniques, reflecting a lack of consensus on the best ways to
reduce violence. Most of the districts in the Los Angeles-Orange
County area, for example, have chosen not to spend money on new
electronic security systems or guards, relying instead on the
random checks with hand-held metal detectors that they have used
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified
School District, said the city's schools were far too large to
check every student entering the building without cutting into
class time. But as a result of the Columbine shooting, he said, the
district will be putting up thousands of signs around its 670
schools that read: ``Making threats is no joke. All threats will be
taken seriously and will subject anyone making them to any and all
applicable criminal and civil penalties, as well as school
discipline, including expulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   Many administrators believe that increased physical security is
futile and counterproductive, noting that Columbine High had
security guards and that Heritage High, the school in Conyers where
a 15-year-old gunman wounded six other students on May 20, had
surveillance cameras. Instead, these administrators have begun
conducting intensive seminars to train students and teachers to
recognize and defuse threats before they lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to create an image of a police state, and we
don't want dogs sniffing around,'' said Dr. Francis Connor,
superintendent of the Dighton-Rehoboth regional schools, a small
district in southeastern Massachusetts. ``By addressing the
physical changes, you are only dealing with the symptom of the
problem.'' Walled-in students, Connor said, tend to begin feeling
isolated and outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Connor's district has prepared a guide to alert teachers to the
symptoms of students prone to violence. And many districts will
hold meetings with all students to impress on them a new
seriousness about security, and encourage them to report even
jocular-sounding threats made by other students. (Several students
at Heritage High School have said they knew that the teen-age
gunman there had talked of emulating the youths who opened fire at
Columbine High a month earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every time a kid brings a weapon to school, he winds up
showing it to someone else,'' said Jim Kelly, the chief of the
school police in Palm Beach, where a pipe bomb was discovered at a
senior prom in May. ``We're trying to help the kids understand that
if they see that, they're doing their friend a favor by reporting
it, maybe saving them from some prison time. We've got anonymous
hot lines set up, and we want them to feel like they're a part of
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shrewsbury, a suburb of Worcester, Mass., school officials
are working with architects to design a new high school, scheduled
to open in three years, which will have fewer entrances than the
current building and a community liaison office where students and
members of the staff can meet with counselors and police officers
to talk about school security issues. The new building will not,
however, be equipped with any metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Gutekanst, the principal of Shrewsbury High School, said
anyone could evade a metal detector, but not necessarily a system
of adults and students working together to spot threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds a little corny,'' he said, ``but the issue is not
getting metal detectors, it's making sure you have mental
detectors.''
