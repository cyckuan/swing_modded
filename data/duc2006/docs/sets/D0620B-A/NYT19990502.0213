   SEATTLE _ The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at Littleton's
Columbine High School has put Puget Sound-area schools on high
alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a
special meeting this week between Seattle police and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts are also reassessing whether lockdown
drills _ which are not required by law _ should become mandatory,
and are offering training to anxious teachers and principals who
feel ill-prepared to respond to armed intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't dreamt it could be this horrific,'' said Brian
Benzel, chief operations officer of the 48,600-student Seattle
School District, referring to the Columbine killings in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just chilling... It seems like we're going to have to
expand our thinking about how to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Benzel and other district officials are meeting this week with
Seattle police to review emergency strategies and discuss whether
more could be done to prevent an attack like that carried out by
the two heavily armed Columbine seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed very appropriate that we review procedures and
protocol given what happened,'' Benzel said. ``We've had a pretty
good relationship with SPD but we want to look at what could be
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold took the lives of 12 students and one teacher
and injured 20 others on April 20 before turning their weapons on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers,
visiting regularly and getting to know students and school
buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director.
</P>
<P>
   Police SWAT teams have also drilled at Seattle schools, Ferrar
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the worst school slayings in U.S. history,
local secondary schools have beefed up security measures, from
cracking down on even the mildest threat to launching random
weapons sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle's Ballard High School, principal Chuck Chinn followed
the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up
locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal
detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before
the Colorado killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the students on notice,'' Chinn said. ``There were
virtually no complaints because the kids understood.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1,120-student Ballard High School, like many schools,
has never done a lockdown drill, and Chinn said he is reviewing
whether that is now necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence erupted at Columbine, many local districts had
already begun revising their emergency manuals to include the
threat of armed attacks because of the string of school shootings
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now districts are moving up timetables for training school
staff, said Pegi McEvoy, the Seattle district's safety coordinator.
She's been inundated with requests for security training from
worried teachers.``We are in a state of hyper-vigilance,'' McEvoy
said. ``Just because you have a plan doesn't mean you know what's
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers want basic information, from how to get a lock
installed on a classroom door to advice for shielding students from
armed intruders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling students to `drop and cover' can be the wrong thing to
do,'' McEvoy said. ``You then become a sitting duck and they can
just come up and shoot you. We saw that in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, running for safety or trying to get out a window could
be a better strategy, she said. A teacher might need to pull the
shades on a window to block an intruder's view, or barricade a
door.
</P>
<P>
   Some security officials say that lawmakers should make lockdown
drills mandatory so that schools are better prepared to protect
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly is an issue here that the Legislature should
visit about making lockdowns a requirement,'' said Michael Sweeney,
security director for the 21,300-student Federal Way School
district in Washington state. ``It would overcome the
inconsistencies with which schools practice lockdown drills.''
</P>
<P>
   A lockdown is used when a principal determines that there is an
external threat to students and staff, from a violent incident near
a school to an armed intruder within the building.
</P>
<P>
   Every school has a predetermined signal _ such as a specific
number of bells or buzzers _ that alerts staff about a lockdown,
and the PA system is also used to give additional information.
</P>
<P>
   During a lockdown, students are held in their classrooms and all
doors are locked until further instructions are provided about when
and how to clear the building.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25,000-student Kent School District in Kent, Wash.,
security staff are compiling computerized blueprints and aerial
photos of each of the 38 schools, said Jim Shimensky, King County
Sheriff's liaison deputy and Kent security director.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent SWAT team has also trained in schools after hours.
``It's like an insurance policy,'' Shimensky said. ``If something
should happen, they will know the layout and be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kent district has also increased the money it spends
training security officers, including requiring them to attend a
two-week academy annually, and has boosted salaries to ensure
top-quality staff, Shimensky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shimensky believes that a crucial key to preventing school
violence is encouraging students to report threats and weapons to
school staff, police and on anonymous tip lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids know what is going on before the adults do,''
Shimensky said. ``That's how we've found most of the major weapons
in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of installing permanent metal detectors at school
entrances won little support from school officials, who say it
would not only be costly and a logistical nightmare but would be
ineffective because determined students would find a way to smuggle
in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running a school district not a prison system,'' said
Ferrar, Seattle's security director. ``Where do we draw the line? I
just don't see a simple solution.''
