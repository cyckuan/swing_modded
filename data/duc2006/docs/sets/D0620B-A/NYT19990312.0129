   MELROSE, Mass. _ Unless local school parent councils vote
otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could
be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once
they get home.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a calf-length red velveteen coat over a black
Amityville T-shirt, calf-high boots and with a casket-shaped purse
slung over her shoulder, Melrose High school senior Erica Muxie was
horrified at the thought of uniformity being imposed upon her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a public school, you should be able to express
yourself,'' said the spiked-collar sporting Muxie, who plans to
study forensic science in college.
</P>
<P>
   But Governor Paul Cellucci _ and dozens of school officials and
politicians across the country _ argue the opposite: if too much
attention is spent on looking sharp in school, learning suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci proposed legislation Thursday that would require all
schools to have uniforms unless their local parent councils opted
out. This would effectively force each school to at least debate
the uniform issue.
</P>
<P>
   That debate has already been resolved in New York, where the
city's 550,000 elementary school students will be required to wear
uniforms this fall, following a school uniform revival that began
in Long Beach, Calif. in 1994. About 10 states have some type of
school uniform regulation, in addition to scores of individual
cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, several cities, including Lawrence and
Springfield, have uniform policies, although they vary greatly.
Lawrence and Springfield require students to wear them, while
Boston allows its schools to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our proposal, Massachusetts will join a nationwide trend
that has seen parents, teachers, principals and school committees
work together to promote an atmosphere of safety and seriousness in
their classrooms by regulating what students wear to school each
day,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The school uniform issue is far from new in Massachusetts, but
still ignites enormous passion, no matter what the age of a
student, teacher or parent. It was an issue in the 1993 mayoral
race in Boston, and in the 1996 presidential campaign. In 1997,
Gov. William Weld filed legislation allowing schools to require
uniforms if they chose, but it died.
</P>
<P>
   The parent councils Cellucci mentioned also include school
principals, teachers, and, in some cases, community leaders and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lawrence began requiring in 1994 that students wear navy
blue pants or skirt and white shirt every day, ``I've seen immense
changes,'' said Denise McCarthy, principal of the Wetherbee
Saunders Elementary School. ``The children felt better about
themselves. It gave them a sense of belonging to both the school
district and the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents say the uniform both prevents violence over
clothes, and sets a tone of the classroom as a serious place for
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids fight over clothes, they steal clothes,'' said Carl
Askins a Jamaica Plain parent of two children in Boston public
schools, who sits on the city's Parent Council. He said he would
want more information before deciding on a mandatory policy, but
that the cost of being fashionable in public schools is an undue
burden on many parents.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, while largely negative on uniform policies, do admit they
can work. Dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie at the East Boston
Edwards School, where Cellucci made his announcement, Chris Hunt,
13, said ``everyone hates'' his school's uniform of khaki or blue
khaki pants and white or navy blue sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hunt said, ``you can't judge other kids by their
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Melrose High senior Muxie on the other hand said that if forced
to wear a uniform, ``I wouldn't feel like myself anymore. So I
would be less inclined to try to do well in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1960s, uniforms in public schools were commonplace,
then largely abandoned in that free-spirited decade. It was as
school violence and classroom disruptions increased across the
country in the '80s and early 1990s that uniforms caught on again.
</P>
<P>
   After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction
in school crime and an increase in attendance. Chicago school
officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform
policies in many of their schools.
</P>
<P>
   What courts may still have to decide in Massachusetts is whether
schools have the right to make uniforms mandatory. In Lawrence and
Boston, if parents protest the uniforms, their children can usually
wear what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is voluntary it is fine. When it becomes mandatory, it
becomes more problematic,'' said John Roberts, executive director
of the ACLU of Massachusetts. He said buying uniforms might provide
a financial hardship for parents and the argument that uniforms can
save parents' money isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just go home and get out of them and put something else
on,'' Roberts said.
