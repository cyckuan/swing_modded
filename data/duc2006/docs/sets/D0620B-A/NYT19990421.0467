<P>
   HOUSTON _ To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school
districts should consider some measures used by their urban
counterparts, experts and educators say.
</P>
<P>
   None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban
schools. Experts say that's probably because they stress such
prevention measures as metal detectors, increased security, school
uniforms, parental involvement, alternative schools and
conflict-resolution programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of suburban school districts, they haven't had to
think about this,'' said Joanne McDaniel, research director for the
Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help, she said, when school districts that
haven't had to deal with serious violence ignore the multifaceted
problems that lead to incidents such as the murders of 15 students
Tuesday attack in Littleton, Col.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as
requiring students to wear school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 70 percent of our schools require uniforms, which
make it hard to hide a weapon and prevent the wearing of
gang-related clothing,'' said Terry Abbott, Houston Independent
School District spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether real or perceived, violence in the nation's schools has
been an issue of concern, research and debate for more than two
decades. When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in
Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon happen, some
districts look, listen and search for ways not to become the next
Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Bend Independent School District southwest of
Houston, administrators such as Mary Ann Simpson, the associate
superintendent for community relations, are watching the TV
coverage from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of turning our schools into prisons, there is no 100
percent guarantee that you can eliminate this kind of thing,'' she
said. ``But you can certainly look for ways to strengthen and
improve what you have in place ... and listen to our kids, talk to
our kids, especially those that seem isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does
have district police officers at middle and high school campuses,
video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student
crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Aultman-Bettridge, a researcher with the Center for the
Study and Prevention of Violence in Boulder, Colo., isn't sure the
school shootings in Littleton could have been prevented with better
or more security measures. She believes school climate is more of a
deterrent than metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think installing metal detectors and having armed
police officers roaming the halls is the solution,'' she said. ``We
concentrate a lot on teaching kids math and science, and we don't
integrate things like violence prevention into the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that districts foster an environment where violent
behavior is unacceptable; teach students social skills such as
anger management and empathy; and create a crisis plan and build
partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services,
parents and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools don't exist by themselves,'' Aultman-Bettridge said.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel noted that the majority of the nation's schools
continue to be safe places free of violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still talking small numbers,'' she said. ``But we are
talking serious rage, and we need to get to know our young people
so that when they are feeling rage we can act to help, not just
react.''
