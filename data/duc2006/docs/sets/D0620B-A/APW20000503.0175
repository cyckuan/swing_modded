<HEADLINE> Attorney says 'zero tolerance' policies don't prevent schoolviolence  </HEADLINE>

   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Middle School has a bullying
policy. Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around
with identification badges. And in Hamilton Square, guidance
counselors are ordered to tell administrators when a student talks
of wanting to hurt someone.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators sharing their tactics for averting school
violence at a second annual conference Wednesday unveiled elaborate
safety plans and said they preferred to err on the side of caution
when dealing with threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never be too safe,'' said Linda Batz, the principal of
Hunterdon Central Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve
other students, a teacher and themselves in Littleton, Colo., on
April 20, 1999, some critics have said that schools have taken
zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Sayreville school officials said they would review the
district's zero-tolerance policy after complaints about the
three-day suspension of four kindergartners who were pointing their
fingers at each other while playing ''cops and robbers'' in the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Six elementary school students in Plainfield were suspended for
two days in March after an 11-year-old boy threatened to ''get a
gun'' if other children did not stop teasing him.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Duca, a retired police officer who works as a security
coordinator for the South Brunswick Schools, said school officials
are fearful of not doing enough to stop another Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody is running scared,'' Duca said. ''They're
afraid of being held responsible'' if a school threat escalates
into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Boylan, an attorney at the Education Law Center who
handles students-rights cases, said zero-tolerance policies
illegally keep students from receiving educations and don't result
in safer schools. She cited research that concluded harsh
punishment for intolerable behavior does nothing to stop the
behavior or increase school safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of school districts in the nation have such
policies, she said, and yet suspensions and expulsions have doubled
between 1990 and 1997, indicating that students are not deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the mind of students, it's overcontrol,'' she said, adding
that it may lead to more violence.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woolley, the principal of Lawrence Middle School in
Lawrence Township, said that his school might meet with a parent or
a school psychologist about a student threat before deciding upon a
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   He might not suspend a student for threatening to shoot a rubber
band at someone, for example, but may suspend the student if the
spitball seriously injures another person.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is incumbent on us all to make reasonable decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hammond, the Jefferson County (Colo.) superintendent whose
district includes Columbine, said one of the most important lessons
she learned from the tragedy was that student safety isn't a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have learned to accept that I cannot guarantee the safety of
all of our children,'' Hammond said in a keynote address. ''I
cannot even guarantee my own safety for the rest of this day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel stress every day we have school,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have taken different approaches to the problem. Lawrence
Township's bullying policy bans students from intimidation, use of
force or ''habitual or persistent cruelty.'' The school has made
efforts to reach out to alienated students, Woolley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students must feel that people care about them and that they
have a voice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon Central Regional High School has practiced evacuation
drills. The school requires student identification badges and
equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. The high
school recently sent a police officer dressed in a fright wig and
carrying a gun case to test the school's response to an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Some students directed the officer to principal Batz' office
when he asked, but Batz said in a second drill the ''intruder'' was
reported in two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Square guidance counselors are told to report any
threat a student makes in a counseling session to school
administrators, said Superintendent Neil A. Bencivenga.
