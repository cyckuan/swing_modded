 &HT;    SCHOOLS ADOPTED LOW-KEY RESPONSE TO LITTLETON

   WASHINGTON _ Six years ago, a trench-coated classmate with a
deer rifle and two handguns opened fire in Natalie Hintz's
middle-school math class in Moses Lake, Wash. Hintz was wounded,
and two other students and the teacher were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's similar shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left
15 people dead led to few improvements in security at her high
school, according to Hintz, now an 18-year-old senior.
</P>
<P>
   Her school system's low-key response to the shootings at
Littleton's Columbine High School on April 20 reflects a national
pattern, according to students, school officials, researchers and
safety advocates interviewed in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think new policies were made, but they're not being
vigorously enforced,'' Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer is stationed in her school and most entrances
are locked during the school day, so that outsiders would have to
use the main doors. ``But when kids bang on the door, anyone walks
over to let them in, or like prop the door open,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, we also have a really strict policy that you're not
supposed to walk down a hallway without a pass,'' Hintz said.
``That's not enforced at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that a new emphasis on reporting suspicious activity
can pay off, a girl at her school notified the principal in January
that a boy told her he had a hit list. The boy was expelled, but
Hintz and other survivors of the 1994 shootings didn't learn about
that until a story appeared in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   While school systems located close to Littleton reacted
strongly, most of those who experienced the event only through TV
retreated from a sharp first reaction, gradually returning to
previous practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had effects, but they dwindled down among those who weren't
directly concerned,'' said Sgt. James Stewart of the Atlanta police
department, who supervises officers assigned to the city's schools.
``We were far more concerned a few years ago when we had to arrange
to assess and get some psychological attention for some kids from
the Atlanta schools who were in a local mall when some guy came
through and shot it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the week right after Columbine, the call volume to us
increased tremendously,'' said Jim Jones, vice president of
Security Voice, Inc. His firm in Columbus, Ohio, accepts anonymous
tips on a toll-free ``Safe School Helpline'' it operates for 4,000
of the nation's 15,000 school districts. But he said the tips this
year have been back at their usual level, as low as one per
district per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see evidence that much has changed,'' said Lawrence
Sherman, director of the Fels(cq) Center of Government at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``This is a country in which most gun
violence is concentrated in the inner cities, where it isn't
newsworthy, and it looks like the window of opportunity (that news
coverage of Littleton provided) for improving national gun control
policy may have closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, after a flurry of meetings at which experts and
victims offered suggestions, President Clinton and the bipartisan
House leadership separately appointed working groups on school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups issued long lists of virtually identical suggestions
for new ways _ other than gun control _ that students, parents,
schools and communities can work together to detect, prevent or
cope with school violence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the suggestions that require new federal laws have
been adopted, because each side believes that this might weaken its
leverage in the election-year negotiations over controversial new
regulations for guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next year, we'll have more luck,'' said Rep. Martin
Frost of Texas, Democratic co-chair of the House task force. ``Or
some people may try to add one or two of our recommendations as
amendments to appropriations bills moving through Congress this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican co-chair, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, said,
``I suspect we might be able to get some put into the Juvenile
Justice bill. After that, maybe there could be a second phase for
the task force, where we would make specific recommendations to
appropriations committees and then follow through on that over the
next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Education and Justice departments have given away more than
500,000 copies of ``Early Warning, Timely Response,'' a guide
prepared by experts in 1998. Most copies have been distributed
since the Littleton shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The guide tells school officials, parents and citizens how to
prepare an action plan for detecting, preventing and responding to
threats and crises in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are looking at it,'' said Kevin Dwyer,
president of the National Association of School Psychologists, a
co-author of the guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is no record-keeping of the effect, so we
have no idea how many schools and communities sat down, put some
plans together and implemented them,'' Dwyer said. He also helped
prepare ``Action Guide for Safe Schools,'' a follow-up booklet that
Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney General Janet Reno
are issuing this month.
</P>
<P>
   Solid information on how schools reacted to Littleton should
emerge from a school survey on crime and safety that was mailed to
a sample of 3,000 school principals last month, said the survey's
director, Kathryn Chandler of the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the results are released in December, Ken Trump, a
Cleveland-based school security consultant, will view them
skeptically. ``Based on my 15 years of working with school
officials on school safety, I know for a fact that crimes are
grossly underreported by school officials,'' Trump told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even without hard data, some school security experts and
students said that since the Littleton shootings, they have
observed several useful trends on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have phased in innovations that range from more visible
security procedures and creation of more local chapters of SAVE
(Students Against Violence Everywhere) to a more efficient use of
school psychologists and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   The beefed-up security procedures include surveillance cameras,
metal detectors, see-through bookbags, id cards for all students
and teachers, and crisis-reaction drills.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``A drill for a bomb threat is just like a fire drill, only it
takes longer,'' said Kelly Boyd, a high school junior in Montgomery
County, Md. ``But if someone fires a gun in school, I don't think
most people are going to remember which exit they are supposed to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher federal subsidies have increased the number of police
working for or assigned to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've got the resources made available to us that
let us do the positive, proactive programs. That includes providing
kids with more positive inter-action with adults through
after-school programs that are a combination of tutorial and
recreational programs,'' said Jim Kelly, police chief of the school
district of Palm Beach County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern as crime statistics go down is that, as more
people realize that school are the safest place for your child to
be, the government powers that be might decide they've solved that
problem and turn to another one,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of school psychologists and counselors may have
increased slightly, according to their national associations.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Gallagher of San Antonio, president of the American School
Counselors Association, said, ``More importantly, I have counselors
telling me they are getting to do more of the mental health work
that they are trained to do, rather than to be used primarily as
test administrators and clerical workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't hear that at all,'' said Scott Poland
of Cypress, Texas, author of ``Coping with Crisis'' and a school
psychologist who has been part of teams dealing with multiple
shootings in several states. ``There are still too many cases where
kids know there is a gun on campus, or that a student shows signs
of being homicidal or suicidal, but the kids won't come forward and
tell an adult.''
