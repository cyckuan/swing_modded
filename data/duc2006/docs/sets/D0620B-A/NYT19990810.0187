 &HT;    GUN EXPULSIONS DROP IN U.S. SCHOOLS

   WASHINGTON _ Despite a well-publicized spate of school
shootings, the number of students expelled for bringing a gun to a
public school dropped nationally in the 1997-98 school year, the
U.S. Education Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Expulsions for gun possession dropped by as much as 31 percent,
although inaccurate or incomplete data submitted by some states
made precision impossible. As many as 5,700 students in 1996-97 and
roughly 3,900 in 1997-98 were expelled for bringing a firearm to
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent gun-related expulsions, 61 percent involved a
handgun, 7 percent a rifle or shotgun, and the remaining 32 percent
another type of firearm or explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharp decline in the number of students bringing guns to
school tells us that we are starting to move in the right
direction,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Gun Free Schools Act requires states that want
federal aid for their schools to adopt and enforce laws that
require an automatic one-year expulsion of a student who brings a
gun to school.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that about 57 percent of the expelled children
received no alternative education during their expulsion, a policy
that the Clinton administration has proposed to outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed that the one-year expulsion was shortened
on a case-by-case basis for 44 percent of those expelled. About
one-third of those whose expulsions were shortened had learning,
emotional or physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials agree that the decline in expulsions
was due to fewer violations, rather than laxer enforcement by
schools, according to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drop was consistent with reports by the Department
of Justice of a decline in gun-related violent crimes for all ages
in all locations, and by the Centers for Disease Control of a
decline in ``violence-related behavior'' by young people.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the trend was boosted by consistent enforcement of
strict rules and by tighter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, according to school-district security officials
who joined Riley for the announcement, is that more children think
they might be caught. The officials said adults and students alike
are more likely to report gun-toting students than they were before
the mass shootings in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro,
Ark.; Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore., and this year in
Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community, they're our eyes and ears, and we can rely on
them,'' said Lt. Karen Hall of the Atlanta public schools.
``They'll report anything from a burglary in progress to students
being disruptive or being where they're not supposed to be.''

   Schools remain the safest place for children, with fewer than
one out of 100 murders of children taking place in or around
schools. But many educators either share or feel they must respond
to public concerns that crescendoed after a teacher and 14 students
died at Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a still a lot of school districts that don't know
what they are doing,'' acknowledged Jack Martin, chief of police
for the Indianapolis public schools. But this summer, even small
districts that felt most distant from urban violence have been
trying to find out which ``best practices'' are affordable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are trying everything from hand-held metal detectors and
closed-circuit TV cameras to policies that require transparent
bookbags or forbid clothing baggy enough to conceal weapons, the
security chiefs said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by parents, communities and law enforcement to identify
and assist ``red-flag children'' before they commit dangerous acts
will do far more to make other children safe, said Edward Ray,
director of security for the Denver public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to see our schools transformed into
institutions with concrete walls surrounded by concertina wire,''
Ray said.
