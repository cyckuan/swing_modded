   At graduation Friday night (May 21) at Hobbton High School in
rural North Carolina, Principal Stewart Hobbs will wear a
bulletproof vest. He will be guarded by a sheriff's deputy, and an
expert marksman will be posted on the water tower that overlooks
the football field where the seniors will receive their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the ceremony will have to pass through a metal
detector, and the crowd will be peppered with plainclothes officers
on the lookout for a potential killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt anything will happen, but right now, the way things
are, you just can't take any chances,'' Hobbs said in an interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs's precautions _ taken in response to a death threat
telephoned to the local sheriff's department on Monday _ seem a
fitting punctuation mark to a school year that can't end soon
enough for students, teachers, administrators and parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., a sense of foreboding has enveloped schools
across the country. There are nagging fears and whispered worries
that the angry kid, or the outcast kid, or the quiet kid, or the
heartbroken kid, or the kid no one would ever expect, might
suddenly erupt in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Just such an event happened Thursday in Conyers, Ga., 25 miles
east of Atlanta, where a 15-year-old sophomore who reportedly had
recently broken up with his girlfriend shot six fellow students
then surrendered his gun and cried. None of the injuries appeared
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the one-month anniversary of the Columbine High School
shootings that ended 15 lives, the incident reinforced the growing
_ some would say exaggerated _ perception that schools must now be
considered danger zones.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's shootings, those fears had been fueled
primarily by a rash of bomb threats that emptied schools and
attracted widespread media attention, which by some accounts
created a cycle of even more copycat threats.
</P>
<P>
   Before Columbine _ where the two killers came armed with more
than 50 explosives _ school bomb threats were usually ignored by
the media in the belief that publicizing such events only
encourages more. There is no way to tell whether such threats have
increased since the April 20 massacre, or whether the public is
simply learning how frequently they occur. But authorities on
school violence said Thursday that the perception of greater risk
seems to reflect a troubling reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're all wrestling with is the question of
where did all these crazies come from at one time? There's a
feeling among some people that they were always out there, and were
just waiting for a psychological release like Columbine so they
could carry out their plans,'' said Peter Blauvelt, president of
the National Alliance for Safe Schools in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are going to need to spend this summer trying to
develop strategies to take a hard look at their populations,
because they clearly need additional help,'' Blauvelt added.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, authorities say, they have no doubt the Colorado
shootings unleashed a murderous plan. The incident involved four
boys arrested last week in Port Huron, Mich., for allegedly
plotting to kill dozens of their schoolmates. Afterward, a
prosecutor said the investigation showed the youths' goal was ``to
kill more people than in Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing, the local school board president, David
Devendorf, pleaded for two of the suspects, both 13, to be kept in
custody. ``You can't believe the fear out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations from Columbine also have been felt in Allen,
Texas, where school administrators in the Dallas suburb went so far
as to cancel the last two weeks of classes after a dozen bomb
threats in a single week. Criticized by some parents for
capitulating to terror, school officials rescinded the closure and
decided to hold some classes. Still, some parents were steaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got overly alarmed and sent a message to kids that they
couldn't control what happens in school,'' said Al Burke, whose
twin daughters Jackie and Jessica are seniors at Allen High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the overreaction can do as much damage as the
threat itself,'' said Burke, who runs a sports ticket agency. ``I
don't think we should be sending our kids to school in the morning
and telling them to watch out for the bomb that might get dropped
on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   No part of the country has remained untouched. In Lake County,
Fla., the school board said a dog trained to sniff out guns and
bombs would roam school hallways next year. A bomb threat in
Phoenix kept 1,700 students home on a test day; a student who
allegedly bragged about the feat was suspended. Maryland schools
were paralyzed by a rumor that May 10 would be a day of violence.
And in the nation's capital, all but one of the city's 17 high
schools were evacuated on April 26 because of a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts schools also have been beset by numerous bomb and
massacre threats. In Cohasset, for instance, someone scrawled ``May
6 you will die'' on a boys' bathroom wall; nothing happened, but a
quarter of the middle and high school students stayed home that
day. Boston schools responded by establishing an anonymous tip line
for students to report fears of impending violence.
</P>
<P>
   Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses
by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the
wake of Columbine. They said the Colorado killings ratcheted up
fears because of the amount of firepower and planning that went
into the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Littleton, with the mass destruction involved and the
knowledge that such materials are available to students, the stakes
were raised,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the
National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had felt like schools in the suburbs were insulated, and
the message now is that it can and does happen where we least
expect it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fears, authorities hasten to note that schools are
extremely safe. Historically, fewer than 1 percent of homicides
involving school-age children have occurred in or around schools,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. Since 1992, the
annual death toll from school shootings has ranged from 20 to 55,
according to the National School Safety Center, including suicides.
There have been 24 school shooting deaths so far this year,
including the 15 in Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne McDaniel, research director at the Center for the
Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., said the overall
knowledge that schools are safe might have led to a sense of
complacency before Columbine, despite past school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become good at identifying warning signs, but I think in
some cases we're still too slow to respond. That's a sign of
complacency,'' she said. However, McDaniel added, the response to
Columbine makes it unlikely schools will take danger signals
lightly anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Yoxall, spokeswoman for the National PTA, said her
organization intends to use that attention to focus resources and
energy on the problem before the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to keep this issue at the forefront of concern
for all of American society. Until we are really willing to address
the problems of school violence as a society, we're not going to be
able to effect lasting change,'' Yoxall said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hobbs, the North Carolina principal targetted by an
anonymous death threat, he said the precautions he takes will not
end when the last diploma is handed out.
</P>
<P>
   A new policy at his school calls for all doors to be locked
except for the main entrance; all bathrooms have been closed off
except for one; more lights have been installed outside the school;
and a wooded area behind the school is being cleared, to prevent
potential attacks from being lauched from the dense cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like every day I walk into this school I put my life on
the line, and sometimes I sit there and wonder why I do that,''
Hobbs said. ``But it's the good days and it's these kids who come
back down the road and thank you, and that's when you know why you
keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a group of about 20 high-spirited seniors crowded
around him, begging for extra tickets to the graduation.
