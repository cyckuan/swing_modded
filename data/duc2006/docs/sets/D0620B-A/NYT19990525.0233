 &HT;    Statistics can skewer realities of firearms

   ATLANTA _ It's a shocking statistic: Six thousand students were
caught bringing guns to U.S. schools during the past two years, but
a mere 13 cases were prosecuted under a federal law the Clinton
administration promoted to keep guns away from schools.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the call for additional gun control after a wave
of school shootings, the purported gap between arrests and
prosecutions has been cited and recited by political figures and
others who say existing laws should be better enforced before new
gun restrictions are imposed. It will be a central theme of a House
hearing Thursday into new gun-control proposals.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: While plenty shocking, this statistic
isn't entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that about 6,000 students were cited in 1997 and 1998
under the federal Gun-Free Schools Act for bringing firearms to
school. But, as the law requires, those students were suspended
from school and charged as juvenile delinquents in state and local
courts.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the U.S. Justice Department prosecuted just
13 people the past two years under the federal Gun-Free School Zone
Act, a separate law that prohibits the possession of firearms
within 1,000 feet of a school. But thousands of other defendants
who allegedly violated the federal law, including the 15-year-old
accused of shooting six classmates at Heritage High School in
Rockdale County, Ga., have been charged or prosecuted under state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutions, authorities say, are reserved for
particularly flagrant cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 prosecutions have nothing to do with the 6,000 instances
of children bringing guns to school, said U.S. Justice Department
and White House officials, who complained that gun-control
opponents have drawn a misleading, if salient, link between the two
numbers to divert attention from the emotional issues of school
violence and firearms restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at any number in a vacuum, you can find a problem
with it,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesman for the Justice
Department. ``This is a total smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the
federal government prosecuted 6,078 gun offenses, the Justice
Department said. State and local prosecutors handled the rest of
the year's 218,900 arrests in which a weapons offense was the most
serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   With political opponents citing such figures, the Clinton
administration's enforcement of existing gun laws is becoming a
focal point in the debate over new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Georgia Republican Party last Saturday, Wayne
LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice
president, deplored ``a collapse of federal firearms law
enforcement.'' At the same meeting, in Augusta, GOP presidential
contender Steve Forbes ridiculed the administration's record on
firearms violations at schools. ``In 1997,'' he said, ``they
prosecuted a total of five. Last year, they prosecuted eight. And
you can hear the White House spin now: From five to eight, that's a
60 percent increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is ready to consider a bill
supported by the president, similar to one the Senate passed last
week, that would mandate background checks on people who buy
weapons at gun shows and would require trigger locks on all
firearms. But at a hearing on Thursday, the House panel first will
ask why Clinton's Justice Department isn't prosecuting more cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken it upon ourselves to federalize a lot of crimes,
and it's the Department of Justice's responsibility to see to it
that those laws are executed and followed,'' said Michael Connolly,
a spokesman for Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.). ``What's
the point of passing new laws? . . . We want to look at how and why
these (new proposals) would be prosecuted differently than the
current record the administration has put together.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Judiciary member, described the
low prosecution figures as ``a major problem for the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this president is interested in is a sound bite, a photo
op with a bunch of cardboard cops behind him to show that he's
tough on crime,'' Barr said. ``They are more interested in limiting
access to firearms by citizens than they are in tackling the misuse
of firearms by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   But a White House spokeswoman said focusing on how many cases
are prosecuted is irrelevant. More important, said Julie Goldberg,
a deputy press secretary, is the fact that the number of reported
violent crimes involving firearms decreased by 29 percent from 1993
to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement alone is not enough,'' Goldberg said. ``There are
other issues that Congress also needs to look at. That's what the
president is hoping to have Congress act on _ his proposals to
prevent crimes and prevent guns from getting into the hands of
children.''
