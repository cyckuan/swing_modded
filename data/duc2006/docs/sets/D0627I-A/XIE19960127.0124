<HEADLINE> U.S. Adoptive Parents Condemns Rumors on China Orphanage Abuse (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of U.S. adoptive
parents and groups involving in adopting children from China
refuted reports in the Western media about the so-called abuse of
children in Chinese orphanages.
</P>
<P>
In their letters faxed to the Chinese ambassador to the U.S.,
they said the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages
is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
They also commended China for their efforts to improve the
welfare of its orphans.
</P>
<P>
Donna Taylor and Belinda Durham at Catholic Charities said in
their fax that "we have been very upset by the recent news and TV
coverage about Chinese orphanages."
</P>
<P>
"One person's report, who happened to be a Chinese doctor, who
was denied a US visa, cannot be reasonable enough to believe,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
"This of course does not reflect our feelings of the Chinese,
the experiences of all of my families who have wonderful daughters
from China, and those who are planning trips in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Sharon R. Grasflin said she and her husband have filed an
adoption petition with the People's Republic of China in hopes of
adopting a precious little girl.
</P>
<P>
She said her adoption agency, China's Children, allowed her and
her husband to look through a notebook in the past month, "full of
beautiful, smiling, happy and well cared for Chinese children who
are waiting to be adopted."
</P>
<P>
"Those children were from many different orphanages throughout
China. I believe that the faces of these adorable Chinese children
provide a true testimony about the care and love that they receive
while waiting to be adopted," she said in her fax to the Chinese
Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Cudy Herdson at Tennessee office of China's Children under the
Children's Hope International, said that "we ... are very
concerned over the recent media publicity about Chinese
orphanages. We just wanted to briefly relay our concern and
outrage at the US media for covering such a story."
</P>
<P>
"We have many families who have adopted from China, and they
always have very wonderful remarks about the Chinese and their
experience in China ... not to mention that the joy of their lives
-- a child has come from your land."
