BERTHA HOLT, 96, A LEADER IN INTERNATIONAL ADOPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in
the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands
of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell,
Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Holt first attracted national attention when she and her
husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were
American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a
lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to
watch a film about Amerasian children in Korean orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Holt later
wrote in ``The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on
adoption. ``We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such
bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching
for someone to care.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon
decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50
years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each
wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Holt later recalled, but
each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take
so many.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more
than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the
Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the
Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from
infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the
process easier.
</P>
<P>
   At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a
daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Holt returned to Korea for more children, while Holt found
families in the United States willing to take them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt
International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system
in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children
were the first such large group to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The Holts, who were Baptist, believed, with missionary fervor,
that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American
families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international
adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born
children were adopted in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be
known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt,
works for the Holt agency in Korea. Holt is also survived by nine
other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack,
Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt
and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine
Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19
grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage
shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha
Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was
a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in
nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt.
The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ``custom
farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough
to buy their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Harry Holt
also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the
Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to
the Willamette Valley in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but
in 1950 Harry Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to
prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Holt more time
to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.
</P>
<P>
   While in Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack
and died. Many thought the agency would close, but his wife took
over, traveling endlessly. Holt also worked to improve conditions
at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage
and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other
countries to set up adoption programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what
I think,''' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the
Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, President Johnson named Holt the National Mother of the
Year, and in 1995, she became the only non-Korean to receive the
Korea National Merit Award. But, Cox said, Holt liked to say that
she preferred the photographs that children sent from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home
could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic
background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after
Holt's death.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive
families, Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible,
which she said she had read 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In
1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the
over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.
