<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Adoption Legislation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an
international treaty on foreign adoptions unanimously passed the
Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international
adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give various federal agencies the authority to
implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the
Senate. The United States signed the measure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides say lawmakers expect the House to ''move swiftly''
in final passage of the implementing language. Once that is
completed, the Senate will consider ratification of the treaty,
although lawmakers have given no indication when that may happen.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are
needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as
prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's
medical condition and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the legislation ''is intended to bring
some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry
adoption services in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys released a statement
saying the measure ''holds tremendous potential to correct some
significantly flawed international adoption practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to
implement the treaty, the measure also includes guidelines for
federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that
work internationally.
