<HEADLINE> House OKs Adoption Treaty Measure  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an
international treaty on foreign adoptions passed the House on
Tuesday after months of gridlock over whether it would allow gay
adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international
adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bill the House passed would give various federal agencies
the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by
two-thirds of the Senate. The United States signed the measure in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides say lawmakers there may take up the measure soon
and even ratify it before Congress leaves for its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this Intercountry Adoption Act will not only
demonstrate America's commitment to the child ... but will enable
those adoptions to go more smoothly and more rapidly,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The measure had hit a snag in recent months as lawmakers debated
whether it would allow gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., successfully lobbied for a provision
that requires the United States to adhere to the laws of countries
that may have marriage requirements or guidelines dealing with
sexual orientation. Several countries, such as China, Romania and
Bulgaria, prohibit gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are
needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as
prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's
medical condition and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Documented abuses range from the charging of exorbitant fees
by so-called 'facilitators' in some countries to child
kidnapping,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass. and the father of
a daughter who came to the United States from Vietnam in the early
1970s, before the fall of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill will help ensure that adoptions are safe, that they
are in the best interest of the child, the birth parent and the
adoptive parent,'' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 international adoptions are expected to take
place this year. The majority of children adopted in the United
States will come from China, official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to
implement the treaty, the House measure also includes guidelines
for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that
work internationally.
