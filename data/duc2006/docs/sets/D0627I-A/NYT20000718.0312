<P>
   A landmark treaty on international adoptions appeared headed for
enactment by the United States, with House passage Tuesday of
legislation to implement the pact and an announcement that the
Senate's lone holdout now supports ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians
active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted
to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the enactment of this treaty will, to a
large degree, eliminate the abuses that currently exist,'' said US
Rep. William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, who was
instrumental in winning passage of the House measure. ``The lack of
ratification was going to have disastrous consequences for all
Americans who are interested in international adoptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its major provisions, the treaty would: establish the
first global standards intended to protect children from being sold
and improve procedures for finding them homes; prevent coercion of
birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their
children; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise
steamline the process for adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on Capitol Hill and within the US adoption community
predicted enactment of the implementing legislation and of the
treaty itself could be completed before Congress adjourns for its
August recess.
</P>
<P>
   US ratification was delayed partly because the process is
lengthy, but also because some American politicians wanted to amend
the agreement in ways that were so controversial that they stalled
its consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as a carefully crafted compromise draft of the
implementing legislation appeared close to passage, one lawmaker in
the Senate and one in the House threatened to use parliamentary
maneuvers to prevent the treaty's ratification if their concerns
weren't addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, had
wanted the implementing legislation to preclude adoptions by
homosexuals, unmarried Americans, and others with ``promiscuous
lifestyles.'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said
he feared the proposed rules would increase costs for adoptive
parents and impose cumbersome standards that would drive small
practitioners out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith finally gave his okay to the House measure after it some
changes that appear to give him some of what he wanted. The
implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish
a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions. The
revision obtained by Smith dictates that the US central authority
will notify American practitioners of the criteria set by other
countries for prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Because China and some other nations are averse to adoption of
their children by gay and single adults, many would-be parents
could be excluded. But there's a loophole: The ``sending'' country
would have to formally notify the US central authority of any
restrictions _ which may not happen because it's in the interest of
those countries to find families for thousands of orphaned and
homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly subtle concessions appear to have been made to win
over Brownback. Asked during a telephone interview whether the
senator was now ready to support passage of the Hague Convention,
his spokesman, Erik Hotmire, replied: ``He now supports the
legislation. ... The deal is done.''
</P>
<P>
   One ``improvement'' cited by Hotmire is that individual states,
in addition to the federal government, will be able to establish
entities like central authorities that could set guidelines and
accredit adoption practitioners. Many if not most states, however,
would probably leave such undertakings to the State Department _
which currently has jurisdiction over international adoptions and
would be the home of America's central authority.
</P>
<P>
   The other revision obtained by Brownback, who with his wife
adopted a daughter from China last December, was to insert language
giving extra time for small and medium agencies to meet the
treaty's standards and gain accreditation. This was not a major
sticking point for any of the pact's negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The final product, said William Pierce, the former president of
the National Council for Adoption and the organization's consultant
on the Hague Convention, ``clearly shows a lot of subtle, nuanced
negotiations between people like Mr. Smith and Mr. Delahunt.'' He
added: ``It is a win for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important immediate result, according to nearly
everyone interviewed, is that nations with concerns about American
adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania, which have
recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured
about the US commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention, named for the Netherlands capital where it
was drafted, was completed in May 1993. Since then, 40 nations have
enacted it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is by far the largest ``receiving'' nation of
international adoptees. Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this
country from abroad, more than double the number of just a decade
earlier.
