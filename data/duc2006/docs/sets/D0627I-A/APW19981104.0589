China moves to make adoptions easier at home
</HEADLINE>

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese couples will find it easier and
foreigners perhaps more difficult to adopt children under a revised
adoption law approved by China's legislature Wednesday, state media
reported.
	   The changes are designed to alleviate overcrowding in
cash-strapped state orphanages and find more orphans homes.
Abandonment, especially of baby girls, has soared under strict
family planning controls that limit most Chinese couples to having
one child.
	   Passed by the standing committee of the National People's
Congress, the revised law reduces the age of prospective Chinese
parents from 35 to 30 years, drops a restriction that couples be
childless and allows for multiple adoptions, the Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   The restrictions were originally intended to make sure Chinese
families did not orchestrate adoptions to circumvent the one-child
limit. Tight laws at home and a rise in abandonment also helped
turn China into a popular place for Westerners, especially
Americans, looking to adopt.
	   Fearing further international condemnation of its much
criticized family planning policies, the Chinese government has
never said how many children are in state care. Foreigners adopted
4,191 Chinese children in the 12 months ending in September.
	   Xinhua reported that the revised law requires prospective
adoptive parents from abroad to provide extensive information on
their background _ all notarized by authorities in their home
countries.
	   Foreigners will also have to sign agreements with the person or
institution offering the adoption and register it with the Chinese
government, Xinhua said.
	   The report did not indicate how the changes for foreigners
differ from current procedures.
	   The new law also sets out fines and other punishments for people
who abandon or sell children, Xinhua said, without elaborating.
