Yeltsin signs amendments to adoption bill into law 
</HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin Saturday signed a revised
adoption law that would tighten control over foreign adoptions and
encourage more Russians to adopt children.
	   The amendments to Russia's adoption law were approved by the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, on June 5 and passed by
the upper house, the Federation Council, on June 10.
	   The Kremlin press office said Yeltsin signed the amendments to
the law to give the state more control over adoptions and ``to
insure the rights and interests of children in adoptions.''
	   The original version of the law introduced in parliament earlier
in the year said that Russia must sign agreements with other
countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept. 1, 1999.
	   The amended version of the bill contained no time limit for the
prospective international agreements to be signed, meaning pending
adoptions will not be stalled by the measure.
	   The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia
only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out
the rules. In the interim, prospective foreign parents can use the
services of proxies as they do now.
	   According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign
adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia,
usually through Russian intermediaries.
