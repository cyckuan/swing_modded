   NEW YORK _ Though he left in 1959, when he was 5, Thomas Grover
Masters can recall vivid details of his childhood in Korea: The
rationed powdered milk he used to eat because it was sweetened. The
three nights he spent sleeping next to his mother's body when,
unable to care for her three children alone, she poisoned herself.
The yellow beret his uncle gave him when he was sent to the
orphanage in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After he was adopted and brought to America, some of his
memories were edged out by new experiences: Catholic school and the
track team, bacon and eggs. His name, Suh Ung Ki, became Tommy; his
new sister, a Korean girl his age who was adopted at the same time,
was called Mary Jane. English words blotted out Korean. He forgot
the names of his biological brother and sister. He even forgot,
almost, that he was Korean at all.
</P>
<P>
   As Tommy and Mary Jane grew up in Wichita, Kan., their parents
had no map to navigate the psychological journey from there to
here; they did not know a word of the language their new children
spoke. They were advised that it was best to help Tommy and Mary
Jane forget the shell-shattered world they had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, international adoptions are nothing like what Masters
experienced. Would-be parents are screened for cultural
sensitivity. They join adoption support groups. Children go to
culture camps, language lessons, and play groups for adopted kids.
At a conference in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., last weekend organized
by a group for adopted Koreans and their families, race was the
most prominent topic for the 400 families attending.
</P>
<P>
   As children learned Korean-style brush painting in one part of
the Hasbrouck Heights Hilton on Saturday, Masters advised parents
on the importance of learning about their children's native
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to realize that to the children, adoption is also
a sense of loss,'' he explained. ``Loss of their roots, parts of
their personal identity, their biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the children don't even realize that they
have lost this part of themselves until much later.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a speech Masters, 46, is making more and more often, at
all kinds of adoption-related gatherings, not just those focused on
Korea. He also helped found Also Known As, a New York group of
about 300 younger adults, adopted themselves, who now serve as
mentors to adopted children. Koreans his age have been the first to
speak about growing up unprepared to face a world that perceived
them as Asian when they saw themselves as American.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that Korean adoptees have taught the rest of the
adoption community is that absence does not take away the
importance of culture,'' said Margie Perscheid, an adoptive parent
from Washington who helped organize the weekend conference. ``These
adult adoptees can tell the adoption professionals who thought they
knew it all that they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   While adoption professionals are quick to point out that only a
small fraction of the thousands of adoptive families in the United
States participate in cultural awareness events and support groups,
they say more and more parents are seeking guidance on how to
handle the issue of race in their families.
</P>
<P>
   Guy and Tina Lindgren came to the conference from the
predominantly white town of Conway, Ark., hoping to get pointers
from other adoptive parents on bringing up their adopted son,
Andrew, 22 months. ``Andrew is not your average Arkansan, and
pretty soon he's going to know that,'' Lindgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindgrens said they read about Korea regularly, and plan to
take Andrew there when he is 4 or 5 to visit his old foster
parents. The family, including Andrew, is learning Korean from a
Korean student attending a nearby college.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950's, adopting foreign children was so unusual that
local newspapers often covered the event. Many older adoptees
growing up in small towns never saw another Asian, much less
another adopted Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Although scattered international adoptions took place after
World War II, families in which the children looked markedly
different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War.
Harry Holt, a deeply religious Oregon farmer, and his wife, Bertha,
decided that the Lord intended for them to save Korean war orphans
who had been fathered, and then deserted, by American GI's. The
Holts adopted eight babies. And determined to find homes for
hundreds more Korean children, they started an agency, Holt
International Children's Services. Between 1955 and 1960, 3,500
Korean children were adopted by American and European families.
</P>
<P>
   While nowadays, more children are adopted each year from Russia
and China, South Korea's system remains the model for international
adoptions, and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the
United States. Last year, about 16,000 children were adopted from
overseas, 2,000 from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Masters regularly fought with other children
because he looked different, and his sister was taunted at school.
But he was proud when Mary Jane, as the only ``exotic'' beauty on
the local modeling agency's roster, was hired to dress up as a
Native American and hand out cigars, and to sit on the lap of
Wichita's mayor as he rode in a rickshaw for Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned, Korea, Japan, China _ those areas
were all the same,'' Masters, 46, said in an interview in his
apartment in East Brunswick, N.J. After college, Masters worked as
a Wichita police officer, then went to law school and became an
agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His sister, Mary Jane
Brooks, now works as a nanny in Niceville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, shortly after Masters was hird, the FBI sent him to
Las Vegas, where he was invited to a Korean Lions Club dinner.
There, he said, he encountered a roomful of Koreans for the first
time since leaving his native country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It completely destroyed all the stereotypes that I ever had of
Asians,'' he said, remembering his shock at seeing his hosts drain
tumblers of bourbon when he had been told that Asians were unable
to handle alcohol _ a myth he believed even after he began drinking
himself. The experience prompted him to learn more about his roots.
</P>
<P>
   For other adopted adults, curiosity about the past was kindled
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Enrico, 41, a New York journalist who grew up in Indiana,
became interested as she recognized how she appeared to others.
``If people were going to see me as Asian,'' she said, ``it became
really clear to me that I owed it to myself to know what that
meant. It was something that belonged to me that I missed having.''
Her first visit to Korea in 1997 led her to adopt a Korean child,
Eleanor, now nearly 2.
</P>
<P>
   The journey back to Korea, whether metaphorical or actual, can
be rough. In Korean society, adoptees are seen as victims of
misfortune, and adoptees say Koreans there and here sometimes
reject them for being too Western or for not speaking better
Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some adoptees think adoptive parents can approach the
job of educating their children with too much zeal. Hollee
McGinnis, 28, who founded Also Known As with Masters' help, said
some parents clung to their children's ethnic identity as if it
were their own, or treated their forays into Asian culture as an
exotic adventure. She cautioned against forcing culture camps and
language lessons on a reluctant child. She said she was glad that
her parents had not talked openly about her ``Koreanness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent half my life not having to think about being Asian,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But adoptive parents say they want to give their children the
tools to deal with who they are in a complex cultural landscape.
``Many adoptive families really do consider themselves to be the
harbingers of a new way of looking at race,'' said Perscheid, the
conference organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Masters and Enrico are not so sure. They said
that all else being equal, it would be less traumatic for children
if they could find homes in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both were also quick to say that adoption gave
them a better life than they would have if they had remained in
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would be cleaning up the streets,'' said Masters,
now a new-media and international-trade consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``it would have added so much more quality to
my life, knowing that we weren't alone.''
