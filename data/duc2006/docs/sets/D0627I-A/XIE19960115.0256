<HEADLINE> Chinese Orphanages Are Well Cared For,  Children's Bridge Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Children's Bridge, an
international adoption agency in Canada said in a memorandum that
Chinese orphanages including the disabled children are "well fed
and well cared for".
</P>
<P>
The memorandum dated January 12 and available here today forms
a sharp contrast with the allegations of abuse and deliberate
neglect resulting in death in Chinese orphanages as reported in
the British documentary, "The Dying Room" and recent reports from
the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
It said the Children's Bridge has been actively involved in
adoptions of Chinese children since 1991. "In the course of those
adoptions, approximately 200 persons involved with the Children's
Bridge have visited 18 orphanages in Central China. Several of our
parents have been health care professionals," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said "our parents have freely taken between 50
and 60 hours of videotape and hundreds of photographs. In the
course of their visits, they have had little or no restraints in
terms of their tours through the orphanages."
</P>
<P>
"In our involvement with these Chinese orphanages not one of
our parents has reported or filmed any evidence of mistreatment of
any of the children at any time," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said "over the course of these visits, we have
encountered many disabled children who appear clean, well fed and
well cared for."
</P>
<P>
The Children's Bridge has become increasingly concerned with
the allegations reported by the British Broadcasting Corporation
and the Human Rights Watch, the memorandum said. "It is essential
that our hundreds of positive contacts with Chinese orphanages be
balanced against the two reports."
</P>
<P>
It said "our interactions with the doctors, directors, nurses
and nannies associated directly with the orphanages and with the
officials of the China welfare ministry have, without exception,
been very positive and characterized by their genuine concern with
the well being and welfare of the children in their charge."
