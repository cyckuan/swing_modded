	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodian politicians aren't the only
ones rushing around before elections Sunday. Foreign couples,
especially Americans, are scrambling to adopt children in case a
new government tightens adoption rules.
	   ``We went from the airport to the orphanage to the embassy. I
never even got a chance to shave,'' said Joe Balcerak, of
Rochester, New York. He arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday, picked
up an 18-month-old girl he named Jana Lynn, and they left the
country Friday.
	   At least 22 American families came to adopt babies in the past
week, many with less than four days' notice. Some Europeans also
are adopting, but Americans seem to be the most active. The last
couples left town Friday with their new children.
	   After waiting months, sometimes years, to adopt children,
couples were told that if they could collect the children before
the elections, there would be no wait. Many had never considered
adopting a Cambodian child before last week.
	   Giddy parents congregated at the Sunway Hotel with their new
Cambodian children, rocking them in soft new baby blankets and
dressing them in fuzzy outfits.
	   ``We cleaned out (a nearby orphanage) pretty well,'' Balcerak
said. ``There are maybe only a half dozen left.''
	   Civil war during the 1980s left Cambodia with a surfeit of
orphans and an economy too shattered to care for them. Orphanages
would have perhaps one wet-nurse for eight babies _ meaning most
starved.
	   Cambodia first opened its doors to international adoptions in
1989, and they skyrocketed after a U.N. peacekeeping mission
arrived in 1991. But the country halted foreign adoptions in 1992
for fear that the adoptions could not adequately be monitored.
	   Adoptions began to resume slowly in 1993, under strict
government control. Fewer orphans have lost both parents because of
war; instead, many come from families that cannot afford them.
	   The doors to foreign adoptions have swung wide open amid the
political turmoil that followed a bloody coup last year when
strongman Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   The Ministry of Social Action and Veterans Affairs decided that
if prospective parents could prove that they met the adoption
requirements of their host countries, Cambodia would quickly
approve the requests.
	   A U.S.-based agency, Maine Adoption Placement, which has been
active in matching American couples with orphans, pushed to have a
batch of adoptions arranged before July 25.
	   ``I think they are afraid that the adoption policy might
change'' with Sunday's elections, said Sandy Nickels, the proud new
mother of a two-month-old baby girl, Grace Vandy.
	   Most families said they paid between dlrs 10,000 and dlrs
15,000, about a third of which goes to pay ``processing fees'' to
the Cambodian government. Critics suspect the children are being
rushed out of Cambodia by greedy officials who want to line their
own pockets in case the elections put their jobs in jeopardy.
	   The new parents appeared dazed by the whirlwind of events.
	   ``We had 48 hours to throw together two months of paperwork,''
said Michael Shantzis of San Francisco, the new father of an
18-month-old girl named Theany. Theany spent her last few hours in
Cambodia sleeping on a bench in the hotel's restaurant.
	   Theany's mother, abandoned by her husband, was forced to give
her up because she could not afford to raise her, the new parents
said. They hope to find some way to give money to the family.
