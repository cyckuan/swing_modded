<HEADLINE> U.S. Adoptive Parents Condemns Rumors on China Orphanage Abuse (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvey L. Cripps and Toshie T. Cripps said "it is grossly
unfair to suggest China has a policy of letting children die in
the orphanages based on one person's dated and uncorroborated
report on one orphanage".
</P>
<P>
"The mass media or one organization does not represent the
American people, either. We feel the reports or TV's news make an
unfair impression," they said.
</P>
<P>
John and Elaine Carrillo from Arizona, who are in the last
stage of our adoption process, voiced their similar viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
Ken and Brenda Barker, who have adopted a child in 1992 from
Changsha City in central China's Hunan Province, said "our
experience was very different than that of the recent newspaper
articles, and we visited the orphanage as well."
</P>
<P>
"Our daughter, Joy, is the greatest gift that we could have
ever asked for. Everyone who meets here absolutely adores her. She
is full of 'joy'," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We would love to adopt again, it was such a wonderful
experience. We also loved the people, culture, and land of China,"
they added.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Families with Children From China
(FCC), a national support group for adoptive families of Chinese
children, said the Chinese orphanages operate with very limited
resources, and conditions in the institutions often are Spartan at
best, as they are in many other sections of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted, however, that over the last four-five
years the Chinese government has developed a very successful
international adoption program, allowing about 5,000 children to
be adopted abroad," it added.
</P>
<P>
"It has been the observation of almost all of the thousands of
adopting parents that have visited dozens of different orphanages
that the care provided for their children was as good as possible,
given resource constraints."
</P>
<P>
"The orphanage staffs are faced with the daily challenge of
providing care to growing numbers of children with limited basic
resources, such as formula, clothing and medical supplies," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that "in general, we commend the
Chinese government for their efforts to improve the outcome of
institutionalization for a growing number of children through
their program of foreign adoption."
