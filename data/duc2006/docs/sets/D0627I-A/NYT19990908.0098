   CHESTER, Vt. _ Rocking her granddaughter to sleep, Jayne
Gallagher could hear the raspy, televised voice of Vermont's
governor above the infant's soft breathing: ``Vermont has long been
known as the least diverse state in the nation. That is rapidly
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Howard Dean's words last year, part of a plea for
enlightened attitudes after several race-related incidents, must
have stirred something in Gallagher, who is white, because soon she
was overseeing an unusual merger of two very different worlds _ one
white and rural, the other African and war-torn.
</P>
<P>
   From the small town of Chester, where residents can drive along
country roads all their lives without encountering a black person,
Gallagher started the Ethiopian Adoption Project. Dozens of
families from across the whitest state in the nation have agreed to
adopt 60 children orphaned by Ethiopia's war with neighboring
Eritrea. Gallagher expects the first group of children to begin
arriving in Vermont by December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: What a loving way to diversify Vermont,'' Gallagher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission of mercy, though, has rekindled an emotional debate
over whether children are hurt when they are adopted across racial
and cultural lines. To Gallagher, it matters only that the
children, who have seen their parents die in what is being dubbed
as the world's bloodiest war, have a home and love.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudolph Smith, president of the Association of Black Social
Workers, fears that Ethiopians being brought to live in a culture
as white as Vermont will be stripped of their self-identity.
``Ethiopia is an African culture with black Africans, and Vermont
is a lily, lily white state,'' he said. ``You are going to have a
whole bunch of black children running around who don't know who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's black population of an estimated 3,102 in 1997, which
has never tipped over 1 percent, could easily fit in Boston
University's Walter Brown Arena with room to spare. But as the
state experiences a small but noticeable increase of black and
Asian residents within the past decade, it has also begun to
grapple with race-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be easy,'' said Joe Kroll, whose adopted Korean
daughter Mei Lin, now 22, gives speeches on how hard it was to grow
up in a white world and retain her self-identity.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, executive director of the North American Council of
Adoptable Children, based in St. Paul, said Vermont parents will
struggle with protecting their children and teaching them to
embrace their own culture. ``The sign of a successful interracial
placement is if the child has a strong and healthy self-esteem and
identity toward their own culture or race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skepticism, even from adoption agencies that warned that
white families do not normally adopt African children, Gallagher
received dozens of responses within days of placing ads in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Chatot was one of those callers. For three years,
Chatot and her husband, Paul, a nurse, have wanted to adopt a
child, but finances have prevented them from doing so. But shortly
after Chatot, 40, the mother of two teenagers, read in the
newspaper about Gallagher's efforts and the low cost of the
adoption, she accompanied Gallagher on a plane to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was the right thing to do,'' said Chatot of her
plans to adopt a 4-year-old Ethiopian boy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chatot, Gallagher, and school officials say they do not
see the color of a person's skin, Smith and even multiracial
adoption proponents say it is because they never had to: Most of
the schools in Chester have few if any minority children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont is not Utopia. There is a resistance and the lack of
acknowledgment that it could be racist,'' said one white mother
whose adopted daughter is black.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of her
daughter being taunted more, said the child has had problems in the
school district. She said the family is considering moving from
Windsor County to a more diversified area.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Asian students have always stood out in Vermont.
Nearly 15 years ago, when 18 black basketball players from Boston
got off a bus at Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, it
sent dozens of white children to the school window in awe, said Jim
Collins, one of the school's administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said her goal is to find adoptive families in Ethiopia
for the 20,000 orphans. Meanwhile, communities such as Chester,
Norwich, Brattleboro, and White River Junction, as well as some New
Hampshire towns, are working to bring a piece of Ethiopia to
northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   International festivals are being planned, a local therapist has
volunteered to counsel the families, and local Ethiopians have
agreed to make frequent visits to provide lessons on the African
culture, such as how to cook injera, an Ethiopian staple that
resembles a spongy bread.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 23 of nearly 60 Vermont families _ professionals,
working-class, and single parents _ have completed a state and
immigration process to adopt 29 children. Gallagher, who has used
her own money to set up the program and for travel, has a local
adoption agency called Adoption Advocates Inc. as the international
license holder. She is awaiting a license from The Children and
Youth Administration in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Ethiopian government spokesman, Ethiopians
prefer that their children remain within their own culture. ``But I
think we have to look at it from the interest of the babies. In
Ethiopia we have one policy: Adoptions are done for children that
do not have any choices,'' said Tsegay Wolde-Georgis of the
Ethiopian Embassy in Washington. ``The option between being adopted
by a loving family, whoever he is, and being a street child is a
very easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Christie, the only black school administrator in
Vermont and a resident of White River Junction, said racism can be
subtle and the old ways of thinking can be hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be difficult for them,'' he said. But
Collins, the administrator who may soon have two Ethiopians at the
high school, which has only one black student registered this fall,
thinks it will help open the minds of the isolated rural students
who often hold stereotypes of people different from them.
</P>
<P>
   When Chatot, who works for a pregnancy program, traveled to
Ethiopia, she said the only difference she saw between Vermont and
Ethiopia was the extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who are living in an orphanage in Tigre, have
survived bombings but have watched their parents become victims of
the war. To remind herself of their plight, Gallagher brought the
tattered clothing of some of the orphans who struggle daily to keep
warm and fed.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where many families make their living from farming,
the next day's meal can be as close as the backyard chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, a fat child would be more discriminated against
than a person of a different race,'' said Gallagher, who will take
in two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   While that statement might seem naive in a country seemingly
obsessed with race, state officials such as Kathy Huit of the
governor's office said the comment embraces the accepting spirit
that has long been part of Vermont's history, the first state to
ban slavery in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont has prided itself on its history of tolerance,'' she
said. ``And the governor is making sure we look at the issue of
diversity. He's made it his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vermont can be accepting, but there is still that
element of ignorance,'' Christie said. The adoptive parents ``will
need support.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently he had several students prosecuted at Randolph Area
Vocation Center, where he is the administrator, for spray-painting
racial epithets on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, whose wife is white, has 26 years of living in Vermont
to teach him how to survive in an all-white environment. He picks
his battles, and matter-of-factly drives three hours to his native
Hartford, Conn., to buy black hair-care products. Those skills were
passed along to his daughter, and he hopes Vermonters will pass
them to the new immigrants.
