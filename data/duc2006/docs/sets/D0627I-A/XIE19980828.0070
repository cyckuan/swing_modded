<HEADLINE> China's Lawmakers Say No Stricter Adoption Controls For Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China will not impose more
restrictions on Chinese children adopted by foreigners but will
have more detailed and standardized adoption procedures,
legislators said here today.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many
aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions,
according to a member of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, Wan Shaofen, who was debating the draft.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC
Standing Committee last Monday, Doje Cering, minister of civil
affairs, said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption
of Chinese children by foreigners, but Wan pointed out today that
"requirements" means adoption procedures.
</P>
<P>
She said that new procedures could help protect the safety and
interests of children who are up for adoption and prevent
international crimes.
</P>
<P>
One of the members, Chen Junliang, said that adoption
procedures should be simplified with fewer restrictions for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1997, there were 2,403 adoptions in Liaoning
Province, only five of which were by foreigners.
