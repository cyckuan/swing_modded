	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's attorney general said Thursday
that he wants to suspend all adoptions by foreigners after
complaints that unscrupulous lawyers were taking advantage of poor
women.
	   Attorney General Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate
and the Supreme Court to suspend foreign adoptions of Guatemalan
children while new regulations are drafted to better regulated the
process.
	   Human rights groups have denounced what they say is the
widespread practice of lawyers coercing women into giving up their
babies so they can collect a high adoption fee, usually about dlrs
15,000.
	   Ricardo Alvarado, president of the Guatemalan Lawyers
Association, said his group doesn't oppose the suspension of
foreign adoptions, adding that only a small group of bad lawyers
are to blame for the abuses.
	   In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office
reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all
involving foreigners. This year, the U.S. Embassy expects 1,000
children to be adopted by U.S. citizens alone.
