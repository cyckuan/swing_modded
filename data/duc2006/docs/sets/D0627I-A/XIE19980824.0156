<HEADLINE> China to Set Higher Adoption Standards for Foreigners (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doje said countries throughout the world attach great attention
to transnationals adoptions, and noted that rigorous stipulations
are not only in full accord with international practices, but will
also provide greater protection for adopted children.
</P>
<P>
He said the purposed relaxing restrictions on domestic
adoptions are to provide more orphans with access to family warmth
and ensure healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
The existing law on adoption placed excessive restrictions on
people who are fully capable and willing to adopt children, and
prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and
handicapped minors, according to Doje.
</P>
<P>
"Welfare institutions are less than ideal places to promote the
healthy growth of unfortunate children because of poor living
conditions and the lack of family warm," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The existing law stipulates that people seeking to
adopt must be childless, and can only adopt one orphaned or
handicapped child. The new draft excludes the limitation that
requires people to be childless or to adopt only one child.
</P>
<P>
The draft also lowers the minimum age required for adopting
people from 35 to 30, and removes restrictions on people unable
to bear a child. It also permits some people to adopt children
over the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that all domestic adoptions be registered
with the government, and notes relationships take effect upon
registration and are protected by law.
