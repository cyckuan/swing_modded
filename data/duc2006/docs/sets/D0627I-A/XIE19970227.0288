<HEADLINE> Canada Ratifies Convention on International Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection
of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which was finalized on May 29, 1993, and came
into force on May 1, 1995, seeks to establish safeguards so that
international adoptions are carried out in the best interests of
the children.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000
intercountry adoptions around the world every year, of which 2,000
involve Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an
agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to
harmonize the practices of different countries. This cooperation
will help promote the rights of children in the world," said
Canadian Secretary of State Christine Stewart, who made the
announcement today.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, adoption falls within the jurisdiction of the
provinces and territories, which must pass legislation to apply
the convention.
</P>
<P>
To date, five provinces have passed implementing legislation.
They are British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward
Island and Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
The convention will come into force in these provinces on April
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the convention has also made it necessary
to amend the federal immigration regulations. The amendments
should come into force on April 1, 1997, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six states participated in the drafting of the
convention, which has been already ratified by 13 countries,
including Canada.
