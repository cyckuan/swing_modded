 GOVERNOR TURNS DEAF EAR TO FOES OF
DEATH PENALTY (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By JOHN
MORITZ c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a longtime advocate for prison reform and the
leader of a national anti-death-penalty organization, Charlie
Sullivan has seen the conservative side of presidential candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But he's sayd he's still waiting for a glimpse of the Texas
governor's compassionate side.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the executive director of Citizens United for
Rehabilitation of Errants, or CURE, is attempting to focus the
spotlight on Texas' use of the death penalty as voters put Bush
through his first tests as this year's Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Sullivan comes as Texas prepared to execute its
fifth inmate this month, with two more executions scheduled during
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are working hard, not only in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but in the other early primary states, trying to get
this issue before the voters,'' said Sullivan, a one-time Texan
whose office is in Washington, D.C. ``There have been so many
executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of
their names.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the national front-runner in the GOP presidential
nomination race, is an ardent supporter of the death penalty and
makes no apology for the fact that he has presided over more
executions than any governor in modern U.S. history, and some of
the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said during a recent
campaign swing in Iowa. ``The reason I do is that it saves people's
lives. ... If the punishment is swift, sure and just, it will save
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116
inmates to Huntsville's death chamber. Among those was Karla Faye
Tucker, the first woman to be executed in the state since the Civil
War. Tucker's professed conversion to Christianity became the
subject of countless media profiles in the weeks before she was put
to death 23 months ago for participating in a 1982 pickax slaying
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush withstood pressure to spare Tucker's life from such diverse
sources as liberal activist Bianca Jagger and conservative
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson before allowing the 38-year-old
former prostitute to die.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor
has only limited power to stop an execution. Under state law, the
governor may commute a death sentence only if the 18-member Board
of Pardons and Paroles makes such a recommendation. The governor
may, however, grant a condemned inmate a one-time, 30-day stay of
execution to allow the courts or the parole board more time to
review the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has a governor that is basically leaving it to the
bureaucrats and the people he appoints to make these life-and-death
decisions,'' Sullivan said. ``He has adopted a policy that says,
`Don't bother me unless there's something extraordinary about the
case.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have disputed such assertions, arguing that
each pending execution weighs heavily on the governor's conscience.
Bush has said he reviews cases to ensure that condemned inmates
were granted full access to the courts and to erase any doubt about
whether inmates are guilty of the crime for which they were
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they are frustrated that the death penalty has not
been much of an issue in many states, including Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Claypool, executive director of the anti-death-penalty
Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said capital punishment is ``not on
the radar screen'' in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's really talking about crime issues this year,'' said
Claypool, who heads the 1,200-member organization. ``Iowa does not
have the death penalty, and we've had some periodic battles over
whether we should adopt it. But this year, there has been very
little mention of it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Craig Allin, a political science professor at Cornell
College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said there might be growing notice
of Texas' execution pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is on my radar screen,'' Allin said. ``Texas has
earned the reputation of being the death penalty capital of the
United States. Iowa has an active United Nations Association,
various Christian liberal congregations, chapters of Amnesty
International, etc., who take the death penalty seriously and who
have lobbied against it here in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Allin's colleagues who is active in Iowa GOP
politics, said that such lobbying will likely carry little weight
in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the sort of thing that Republicans will squabble
among themselves about,'' said Robert Sutherland, a Cornell
political science professor and former Houston resident who
supports Bush. ``Even those in the Christian Coalition and the
right-to-life movement are far more concerned with the abortion
issue than with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Challenger, a sociology professor at New Hampshire's
Franklin Pierce College, said issues of crime and punishment are
also taking a back seat in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people up here are aware of what's going on in Texas
with all their executions, but it's not making an impact,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has a death penalty statute, but there has not
been an execution there in more than a half-century, Challenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Iowa voters made their choices for president Monday evening,
Texas inmate Billy George Hughes was scheduled to be strapped onto
the executioner's gurney and given a lethal injection in
Huntsville. Two more inmates are scheduled to die this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry
Keith Robison. Hughes' execution Monday night will be followed by
Glen McGinnis on Tuesday night and James Moreland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's case was the subject of international controversy
because his supporters argued that his 1982 murder spree that left
five dead in the Fort Worth area was likely fueled by paranoid
schizophrenia, a condition that was diagnosed four years earlier.
Prosecutors and relatives of the victims have argued that Robison's
admitted drug use caused any mental defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, Amnesty International and the European Parliament
repeatedly urged Bush to spare Robison, and the same groups are
rallying around McGinnis, arguing that he be saved because he was
17 at the time of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has routinely rejected overtures from abroad. When the
Canadian government objected to the pending execution of one of its
countrymen and a boycott of Texas tourism sites was urged, Bush
simply bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't come into our state and cold-blood murder
somebody,'' Bush said before Joseph Stanley Faulder's execution in
June. ``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their
nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death
Penalty Resource Center, said such rhetoric defies Bush's campaign
mantra of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is all this compassion when it comes to the mentally ill
on Death Row, the people who were sent to Death Row for crimes they
committed as children?'' Dieter asked. ``He could send a meaningful
message about compassion if he would commute their sentences. Not
set them free, just keep them in prison for life.''
