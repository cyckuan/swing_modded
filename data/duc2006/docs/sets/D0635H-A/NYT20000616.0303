COMMENTARY: SHALLOW AND CALLOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been questions all along about the depth and
seriousness of George W. Bush. They have been brought into sharp
focus now by a surprising issue: the way the death penalty is
administered in Texas. In his comments on that subject Bush has
defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.
</P>
<P>
   In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed
131 prisoners _ far more than any other state. Bush has lately
granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions about that record, Bush has repeatedly
said that he has no qualms. ``I'm confident,'' he said last
February, ``that every person that has been put to death in Texas
under my watch has been guilty of the crime charged, and has had
full access to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   That defense of the record ignores many notorious examples of
unfairness in Texas death penalty cases. Lawyers have been under
the influence of cocaine during the trial, or been drunk or asleep.
One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer who slept through a
trial with the comment that courts are not ``obligated to either
constantly monitor trial counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to wake
counsel should he fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report
on an investigation of all 131 death cases in Bush's time. It made
chilling reading.
</P>
<P>
   In one-third of those cases, the report showed, the lawyer who
represented the death penalty defendant at trial or on appeal had
been or was later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned. In 40 cases
the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one witness at the
sentencing phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 29 cases, the prosecution used testimony from a psychiatrist
who _ based on a hypothetical question about the defendant's past _
predicted he would commit future violence. Most of those
psychiatrists testified without having examined the defendant: a
practice condemned professionally as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses included one who was temporarily released from a
psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking
autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Tribune study, Bush said, ``We've adequately
answered innocence or guilt'' in every case. The defendants, he
said, ``had full access to a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways of understanding that comment. Either Bush
was contemptuous of the facts or, on a matter of life and death, he
did not care.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing
lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in
death cases. There is no state system. Judges assign lawyers _
often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State of Texas is a national embarrassment in the area of
indigent legal services,'' a committee of the State Bar of Texas
says in a report just approved. Again, Bush has shown no concern
about this reality. He vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature,
that would have let Texas counties set up a limited public defender
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment, long favored by a majority of Americans, has
become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness
of its administration. Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican,
imposed a moratorium on executions in that state after 13 men on
death row were shown to be innocent. Pat Robertson and other
conservatives have called for a national moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The most complete study ever done of the death penalty process,
by Professor James Liebman and others at Columbia University, was
published the other day. It showed that two-thirds of death
convictions or sentences were upset on appeal for such reasons as
incompetent defense lawyers or prosecutors who bent the rules.
</P>
<P>
   To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent. Or perhaps not
entirely. If he were not running for president, it is doubtful that
he would just now have granted his first stay of execution. Next
week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the testimony of a single
witness who said she saw him at night from 30 to 40 feet away, is
due to be executed. Will Bush care?
