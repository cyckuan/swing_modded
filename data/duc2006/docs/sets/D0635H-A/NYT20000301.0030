<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they took an old woman in Texas from her cell on a
gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her
instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in
Europe _ were agitated.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about
the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't do any good. They don't take much notice of what
the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over
here. There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though
it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor
George W. Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems
to so enjoy its executions. After all, the man was obeying the laws
of Texas, which were made before he entered government.
</P>
<P>
   He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just
as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas.
Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to
him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
And there isn't much doubt that Mrs. Beets was guilty of the crime
she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best
exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life
was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by
killing an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical
politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or
the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades
ago. It's as well to be clear about why it is so. The taking of
life itself is not always wrong, after all.
</P>
<P>
   We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend
ourselves, for instance. And we expect others to do it on our
behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to
achieve some greater good.
</P>
<P>
   But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to
involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal.
Anything else is lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such
good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to
post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill. It is a
commandment. It really is set in stone, and you had better have
some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it.
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops
killing. In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades
after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining
again.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statistical relationship. Any consideration of the
rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what
is at stake here is simple retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is no consideration. Indeed the legal process
permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process
that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course. But it
has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the
legal slums.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to
call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the
death penalty. Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been
released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have
drawn interest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people have died. How many of them were innocent?
Now that they are dead, will we ever know?
</P>
<P>
   This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla
Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually
discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words
that have been frequently quoted since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation,
``don't kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't
blame him for the explosion of state killing. The point is that for
governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a
life has become just too easy.
</P>
<P>
   They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the
governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper
come across their desks. No one in high office questions it: that
would be too hard.
</P>
<P>
   One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however.
Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment
because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had
ended with the conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it
is growing in intensity.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the argument; it's over now. Betty Lou Beets is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone
there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and
Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And
America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL;
