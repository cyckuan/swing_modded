<HEADLINE> Court Stays Texas Execution </HEADLINE>

	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- In a case that death penalty opponents  
portrayed as a test of Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate 
conservatism,'' an appeals court blocked a mentally ill killer's 
execution Tuesday just four hours before he was to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate had said he was unlikely  
to postpone the execution of Larry Robison, who killed five people, 
including an 11-year-old boy and a lover who was beheaded, stabbed 
49 times and sexually mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, 42, said recently he was ``like a little kid at  
Christmas'' looking forward to his lethal injection. His lawyers, 
relatives and capital-punishment opponents contended he was 
mentally ill and deserved treatment rather than death. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the  
state's highest criminal court, blocked Robison's execution and 
sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the 
trial court. State and federal courts had rejected other appeals 
challenging Robison's competency. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision effectively put the execution off for weeks, if not  
months. Prosecutors said Robison will be examined by psychiatrists 
selected by his attorneys and state lawyers and the findings will 
be presented to a trial judge in Fort Worth, who then will rule on 
the prisoner's competence. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general,  
said it was unclear whether the state could or would appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people could  
be executed as long as they understood the punishment and why they 
were getting it. In a concurring opinion to Tuesday's order, Judge 
Tom Price wrote that because Robison ``has long suffered from 
schizophrenia, he does not understand the nature of the punishment 
to be imposed upon him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision at least temporarily kept Bush from having to  
address calls from capital punishment opponents who demanded the 
governor, who has defined himself as a ``compassionate 
conservative,'' give Robison a 30-day reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the citizens of your state and now all  
American voters are entitled to know just how real and deep your 
sense of `compassion' reaches,'' death penalty opponent William B. 
Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, wrote in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was criticized for mocking executed killer Karla Faye  
Tucker in a recent interview published in Talk magazine, has never 
issued a reprieve in nearly five years as governor -- a span that 
has seen 98 executions in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0  
against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life. 
That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day 
reprieve to allow him more time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, however, indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's  
execution. He had no immediate comment after the court ruling 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton found himself in a similar situation just weeks  
before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when as governor of Arkansas 
he allowed a brain-damaged cop killer to be executed. At the time, 
some political observers said Clinton's decision to deny the man 
clemency helped him distance himself from the Democrats' liberal, 
soft-on-crime image. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, a former construction worker, was to be the fifth Texas  
inmate to receive lethal injection this month and the 21st this 
year. Another execution is set for Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a little kid at Christmas waiting for Santa Claus  
to come,'' Robison said in a recent interview. ``I don't believe in 
death. I'm just leaving this vehicle behind. I'm moving on to new 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robison admitted he killed five people in neighboring cottages  
near Lake Worth in 1982. One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 
31, Robison's lover and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, 
decapitated, slashed eight times and stabbed. Robison said he ate 
the man's testicles. 
</P>
<P>
	His case was considered by many critics an example of the  
problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill. Before the 
killings, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, 
but he was not considered violent and had been released from 
several public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted  
him and sentenced him to death.
