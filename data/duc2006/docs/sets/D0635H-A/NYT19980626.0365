BUSH COMMUTES LUCAS' DEATH SENTENCE

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush followed his parole board's
advice Friday and halted Tuesday's planned execution of Henry Lee
Lucas, saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed
killer's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case
carefully,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``The first question
I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the
individual's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first case since I have been the governor when the
answer to that question is `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 61, once confessed to 600 killings. He was scheduled to
die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of
a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near
Interstate 35 in Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to, evidence
later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the
crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville's
Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system's
diagnostic center, where he will undergo psychological evaluation
and other tests before being permanently reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the
guts to stand up for what's right,'' Lucas said in a statement
released by prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his
freedom. He is serving six other life sentences, and 210 years in
prison for nine other murders.
</P>
<P>
   A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death
penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a staunch defender of the death penalty, has not
intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office
3 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye
Tucker, who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly
expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a
couple in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, called
for Tucker to be spared. Bush said he allowed the execution to go
forward because she was undeniably guilty. Tucker, who never
claimed innocence, became the first woman to be executed in Texas
since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be
executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986
investigation by his office, which showed that the condemned man
was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox, a Democrat who is again running for attorney general,
and Bush, a Republican, said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and
should never be released from prison. But carrying out the
execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would
be abhorrent, both said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty
punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox, who added that police
should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions. ``But it was
still politically risky, and I'd be glad to stand up and defend him
against attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn, who
is running against Mattox in the attorney general's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in
the 23 (appellate) judges who reviewed the evidence,'' said Cornyn,
a former Texas Supreme Court Justice. ``I believe their decision
should be respected and their sentence carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro, Bush's opponent in
November's election, said the governor may see some political
fallout from his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian
Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he wouldn't get
involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker, but he's
following Jim Mattox's lead on Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Joe
Cutbirth, Mauro's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision in the Lucas case, made public 24 hours after
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its
recommendation, caps one of Texas' most bizarre crime sagas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his
mother, was arrested in Montague County, Texas, in June 1983 for
being an ex-con with a weapon. While in jail, he confessed to
killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in
Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl
who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   Other confessions followed, and soon Lucas' tally of death
numbered in the hundreds. Almost all were later proved to have been
hoaxes, but Williamson County officials prosecuted him for the 1979
slaying and secured the death penalty.
