TEST FOR BUSH AND TEXAS IN NEAR-EXECUTION 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, the would-be or wouldn't-be
president, got another taste of international diplomacy during the
debate over Texas' near-execution of a Canadian man.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder escaped death by about 30 minutes last
week when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stay of his scheduled
execution for the 1974 robbery and murder of 75-year-old Inez
Phillips of Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
   His case created a controversy in Canada, which blew into Austin
like a blast of Arctic air. It may not have been a clash of
cultures, but it definitely was a clash of opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Canada doesn't have the death penalty, presumably because many _
if not most _ Canadians oppose it. Texas does, and has carried it
out 19 times this year alone and officeholders such as Bush believe
it has strong support among Texans.
</P>
<P>
   At an Austin news conference, one Canadian reporter asked Bush
what he would say to Canadians ``who seem to think that your state
is running kind of a Wild West show down here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder
anybody,'' Bush replied. He also insisted that Texas sought to
assure due process for all, including death row convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was peppered with questions from several Canadian
journalists, who had traveled to Texas to cover Faulder's case. But
he refused to be drawn into a debate over the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his cool, prompting some observers to note that if
he were in training for a presidential race, he passed an early,
minor test.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's potential political future, however, is only a
byproduct of the debate over Faulder. The relevant issue is Texas'
clemency process, which once again has been challenged in a capital
murder case receiving international attention.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for the U.S. Supreme Court, Faulder most likely
would have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected Faulder's
petition for clemency. Without a board recommendation for
commutation of the death sentence or some other form of clemency,
the only option remaining for the governor was one 30-day stay, or
delay, of the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has never granted a stay of execution, including in the
case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death early this year for
her part in two pickax murders in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also received tons of international publicity. Unlike
Faulder, however, Tucker didn't find a receptive court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's actions were consistent in the Faulder debate. Despite
pressure from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who contended that Texas'
handling of Faulder's case violated an international treaty, the
governor didn't intervene on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the parole board recommend clemency for a death row
convict. One of the few cases in recent years occurred a few months
ago, when the board recommended commutation of alleged serial
killer Henry Lee Lucas' death sentence to life imprisonment, and
Bush agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The board and the governor believed that sufficient doubt had
been cast on the evidence in the only case for which Lucas received
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case may result in a judicial review of Texas'
clemency process, which has repeatedly been attacked by death
penalty opponents as secretive and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush obviously believes the parole board, which he appoints,
does its job diligently and fairly and would never knowingly deny
clemency to someone wrongly sentenced to death. And his faith in
the panel is probably justified. Faulder once confessed to the
murder for which he was convicted and didn't raise a claim of
innocence in his clemency petition.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the board normally conducts its business in clemency
decisions _ taking votes by fax machine or telephone from 18
members scattered about the state _ creates at the very least a
public relations and potential political problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will always oppose the death penalty, but regardless
of how one views capital punishment, there should be more openness
in the parole board's clemency procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It may be impractical for all 18 members to meet in the same
place to vote on every case. But maybe we should consider requiring
board members to cast their votes _ and state their reasons for
voting _ over conference call hookups, which reporters and other
members of the public could monitor at a central location.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer friend says my suggestion is fraught with potential
problems. But state law already requires a school board or a county
commissioners court to meet in public to discuss something as
mundane as a printing contract.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with shining more light on life-and-death
decisions?
