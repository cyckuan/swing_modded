<P>
   During her tenure as Texas governor, Ann Richards once stood
atop the state Capitol steps and tried to make an outlandish joke
with a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A television reporter looked up at Richards. ``Are you serious
governor?''
</P>
<P>
   The comedienne-governor rolled her eyes and made a sweeping
motion with her right hand, as if to drive the reporters away as
annoying pests: ``You people can just suck the humor right out of a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, got a taste of what Richards meant this
week with the publication of interviews he granted to a
conservative writer for Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The public has frequently seen an affable George W. Bush or a
serious George W. Bush. What the Talk article captured, creating
discomfort for Bush's presidential campaign, is the cocky George W.
Bush, the one-time fraternity president, former Air National Guard
fighter pilot, oilman and sports team owner.
</P>
<P>
   The article portrays Bush as uninterested in whatever his
administration has done to reduce abortion, as someone who peppers
his regular conversations with various forms of a four-letter
sexual vulgarity, and as mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker,
a pickax murderess who pleaded Bush's office for mercy on the
grounds that she had found religion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said writer Tucker Carlson
captured some of Bush's personality in the piece but that Carlson
had mischaracterized his interviews with Bush, especially the part
about Karla Faye Tucker. Hughes also said no one remembers Bush
using foul language in his interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became visibly angry when asked about the Talk interview
and tried to defer questions to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misrepresented me. I don't remember it happening that way.
I took the Karla Faye Tucker situation very seriously,'' Bush said,
adding that Tucker's execution last year ``was a very somber moment
and a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival Gary Bauer chided Bush over
abortion and the Tucker comments. And Bush received critical
editorial comment from the Manchester Union Leader and
conservative, nationally syndicated columnist George F. Will, who
said the article exposed what he saw as Bush's childishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A critical mass of lightness in a candidate causes the public
mind to snap closed, with the judgment, 'Not ready for prime
time,''' Will wrote. ``He and it (the Republican Party) will care
if on Nov. 7, 2000, people think of (Vice President Al) Gore or
(Bill) Bradley as an unexciting but serious professor and of him as
an amiable fraternity boy, but a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Talk reporter saw, and Will vicariously, was Bush's
inner child.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who cover Bush regularly know there are three distinct
Bush personalities.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the affable Bush. This is the guy most people
meet at campaign rallies. He memorizes people's names and the names
of their children. He calls on reporters by name at news
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the serious Bush. This is the somber man who said
he had prayed over the issue of Karla Faye Tucker before refusing
to grant her a stay of execution and wrestled with his religion's
call to public service.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the cocky Bush, who as a young man can be seen
in a widely circulated family photograph wearing an ``I'm-so-cool''
smirk on his face and a cigarette in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Richards captured this side of Bush's personality in their 1994
campaign when she complained that seeking the governorship was not
a beauty contest: ``You can't wake up one morning, look in the
mirror and say, `Hmm, Hmm, I think you're so cute I think you ought
to run for governor.'''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the self-possessed Bush allows his cocky side to
manifest itself as smart-alecky remarks at news conferences. This
Bush is the one whose own daughters remind him that he is ``not as
cool as he thinks he is,'' the one who thinks of the funny line
before its effect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush's days as a hard-drinking National Guard fighter
pilot-turned oilman, Bush has quit drinking, quit smoking and
married former public school librarian Laura Welch. But that cocky
Bush still shows up.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same kind of cockiness that got his father bad
publicity in 1984 when the self-assured elder Bush emerged from his
vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and popped
off that he had ``kicked a little ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The cocky Gov. Bush who makes flippant comments shows up on days
when he is feeling especially good about himself, such as right
before his inauguration to a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
   The day Talk magazine interviewed Bush was the day he discovered
he had set an all-time fund-raising record for a presidential
primary candidate, $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush's staff is correct in saying Carlson misrepresented
the interview, Bush's attempts at humor have been known by those
who cover him to be flippant.
</P>
<P>
   Any personal torment Bush might have experienced from Tucker's
execution was 16 months behind him while his top-of-the-world
fund-raising was fresh and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   When the cocky Bush is around, the only visible brake on his ego
is Laura Bush, who more than once has been seen popping his balloon
with a needle-like ``Hey!'' or a playful tap to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Laura rarely travels with Bush on his presidential campaign
swings. He says he and his wife believe in historic preservation so
they don't want to leave their twin teen-age daughters alone in the
Texas Governor's Mansion.
