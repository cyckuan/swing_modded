ANALYSIS: TWO MEN, FATES LINKED

   LOS ANGELES _ As Gov. George W. Bush confronts yet another
closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate
decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over
the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half
years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt
the next one.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bush is running for president and the eyes of an
entire nation are upon him as never before, he faces a second,
amplified challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It is to demonstrate, through the tone of his voice and the set
of his jaw, that he feels the full weight of his responsibility.
And it is to show, through his bearing and his choice of words,
that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death
penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the
welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the
death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush's seriousness, a
quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys
that his advocacy of capital punishment in itself carries political
risks, there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few
voters are watching, and judging, the manner in which he navigates
this sensitive terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be careful to portray this in the most sober and
respectful of lights,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a professor who
teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas. ``Any
evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem
for him, not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of
gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   The current case in question is that of Gary Graham, scheduled
to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville,
Texas. Graham was convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the
embattled testimony of a single eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances
of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas
governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion
over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
renders its ruling on the matter this week. If the board authorizes
execution, the most the governor can typically do is grant a
one-time, 30-day reprieve. And Bush's ability to do even that in
Graham's case is in question, since Gov. Ann W. Richards granted
such a reprieve to Graham in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the limits on Bush's discretion, they do not alter
the burden on his public comments and demeanor when the moment of
decision comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gravitas issue is a very important one,'' said Stephen J.
Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University who
specializes in the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can say, in a snide way, `I'm going through
with this, he's guilty, period,''' Wayne said. ``He's got to
demonstrate some reflection in his words.''
</P>
<P>
   The capacity to do so is something that many Americans want in a
president, said Wayne, who, along with other political analysts,
noted that there had been a few occasions when Bush failed to
exhibit it.
</P>
<P>
   A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene,
which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in
which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye
Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate
in early March when Bush laughed, perhaps somewhat nervously, when
asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that
ended with a death sentence for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples are extreme. But there have been many other times
when Bush, who seldom holds any private introspection up to public
light, has responded to questions about capital punishment with
strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn
script.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that
and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as
prolonged and profound.
</P>
<P>
   That was the portrait of the governor that emerged in the
autobiography he published last year, ``A Charge to Keep,'' written
primarily by his communications director, Karen P. Hughes. An
entire chapter of the book was devoted to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for the first time since entering office,
Bush granted a death-row inmate a 30-day reprieve, in defiance of
the Board of Pardons and Paroles. The issue in the case was the
possibility that further DNA testing could clarify the facts
presented at trial, and Bush's decision allowed him to show that he
was neither oblivious nor aloof to a central, scientific reason for
the changing dynamics of the death penalty debate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the
West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be
dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas, Bush was more
voluble on the death penalty than usual.
</P>
<P>
   He said not only that he was standing his ground ``in the face
of a pretty considerable movement to undermine the death penalty in
Texas,'' but also that he understood the passion of that crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I harbor no ill will,'' Bush told reporters. ``I understand
it's a very emotional issue for people. It's an issue where fine
people disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about how much attention he was paying to Graham's case,
he emphasized that he had spent the entire ``trip from the
governor's mansion to the plane'' _ a drive of 15 to 20 minutes _
talking to a state lawyer about it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether accounts like the one about the sleeping lawyer
made him wonder whether people were getting fair trials, he quickly
and succinctly responded, ``That's what the appellate process is
for.''
</P>
<P>
   But several hours later, he returned to the reporter who had
posed the question and pointed out that in that case, the defendant
had confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had clearly gone and done some research. He had just as
clearly come to the conclusion that it was a good idea to let
people know that.
