   AUSTIN, Texas _ The issue of law and order has always been part
of George W. Bush's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for governor of Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy
black-and-white commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at
gunpoint in a parking garage and, a moment later, a police officer
draping a blanket over the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Ann Richards, was
soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals. That
stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the
nearly five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent
in pressing a law-and-order agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has presided over the nation's largest prison-building
program and a record number of executions in his tenure as
governor. He has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry
guns and has opposed gun-control legislation. ``For Governor Bush,
gun control is not yet part of crime control,'' said Travis County
Constable Bruce Elfant, one of the many law-enforcement officials
who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and
gangs in the battle against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative state where being ``Texas tough'' is high
praise, Bush's positions have been popular.
</P>
<P>
   How Bush's record on criminal justice, particularly gun control,
will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he
campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. In Texas,
experts on criminal justice are studying another question: whether
his policies are responsible for the state's drop in crime
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said his initiatives,
especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and
making convicts serve longer terms, had produced a 20 percent drop
in the Texas crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, crime
had already fallen 25 percent under Gov. Richards, from 1991 to
1994, as she pushed a multibillion-dollar-prison-building program.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in 1995, crime rates have also fallen as
much, or more, in most states as they have in Texas. This has led
governors and mayors across the country to take credit, even as
many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates
makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited. Longer
prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease, experts
say, but so are an improved economy, a decline in the use of crack,
new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush ran against Gov. Richards, when he pledged to support
a concealed-weapons bill. When, as governor, he signed the bill
into law in 1995, he declared, ``This is a bill to make Texas a
safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association,
but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas' largest cities, who
were concerned that the law would lead to more violent
confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater
risk to police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents had predicted it would lead to a rash of
shootings. Supporters said it would sharply cut crime. Neither
seems to have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went against the police chiefs of Texas' seven largest
cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks
on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals
and juveniles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requiring background checks died in committee April 20,
a few hours after the school killings in Littleton, Colo., which
were carried out with guns bought at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the
country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents,
second only to Louisiana's 736. By contrast, Minnesota, with the
lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov.
Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took
office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds. When the
buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds. The Bush
administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while
some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued
growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun
to question that state's prison-building program. Republicans worry
about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats
argue that the program has taken money away from the state college
and university system.
</P>
<P>
   The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending
for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna
Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy
Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was
a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of
skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed
the juvenile justice code. One result: a tripling of the number of
young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to
6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has
done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile
Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself
as ``the most conservative man in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the
main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best
interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison
system in which punishment is emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be
sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the
maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a
one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has
presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row
conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev.
Pat Robertson and other religious leaders. She was only the second
woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court
allowed the resumption of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush
``maneuverability'' to commute Ms. Tucker's sentence without
offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington,
director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death
penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or
guilty? And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had
in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death
have been guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker becoming
born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart
and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators
introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally
retarded. Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in
Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to
the Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his
opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,''
with juries having the right to make the decision. The bill died in
the House.
