PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PONTIFF

<P>
   When John F. Kennedy ran for president way back in 1960, one of
the biggest obstacles he faced was his religion: He was a Roman
Catholic, and no Catholic had ever been elected president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his campaign for the Democratic nomination,
Kennedy decided that he needed to address the religious issue, and
he did so by pledging that if elected he would owe his allegiance
to the Constitution and the American people, not to the Catholic
Church and the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The voters took Kennedy at his word, and he went on to win the
White House in a close election over Richard Nixon. Kennedy's
religion was never an issue during his presidency; he adhered to
his promise that the church would not be allowed to meddle in the
secular business of America.
</P>
<P>
   So. If a Catholic president elected nearly 40 years ago took no
marching orders from the pope, why is the Baptist governor of
Missouri giving the pontiff veto power over capital punishment in
1999?
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to St. Louis last week, Pope John Paul II urged
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan to spare the life of a triple murderer
who was scheduled for execution in February. Carnahan complied,
commuting the killer's death sentence to life in prison without
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to support capital punishment,'' Carnahan said
after granting the reprieve to longtime Death Row resident Darrell
Mease, ``but after careful consideration of (the pope's) direct and
personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect for the
pontiff and all he represents, I decided last night to grant his
request.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope had preached against capital punishment Wednesday
during a public Mass at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis, and he
later made a personal request to Carnahan to spare Mease's life.
Mease's execution date had been postponed from Wednesday to Feb.
10, apparently to avoid putting him to death while the pope was in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the pope's plea for mercy, there was no reason for
Carnahan to commute Mease's death sentence. There was no question
that Mease was guilty of the 1988 murders of a fellow drug dealer
and the dealer's wife and grandson. Mease's partisans weren't even
claiming that he had undergone a spectacular Death Row religious
conversion in the manner of the late Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Tucker, the Texas pickax killer? The pope wanted Gov.
George W. Bush to rescue her from the lethal needle, but Bush
adhered to a ruling by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles,
which permitted Tucker to receive the earthly justice she deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor evidently has a better understanding than the
Missouri governor of the distinction between religion and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a Democrat who plans to run for the U.S. Senate next
year, would have been better advised to demonstrate his reverence
for the pope by kissing the pontiff's ring rather than overruling a
jury of Missouri residents and the various courts that have
rejected Mease's appeals over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks, I'm not here to criticize the pope. I did that
once, in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and nearly got run out of town on a
rail.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I spent 12 of my most formative years attending
Catholic schools. I don't want one of the nuns who ruled my life so
many years ago tracking me down and rapping my knuckles for
disrespecting the Holy Father.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is a great and godly man, an inspiration to Catholics
and non-Catholics all around the world. No one will ever catch me
saying otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and religious leaders of all faiths are entitled to
express themselves, in any forum they might choose, regarding what
they believe to be the moral responsibilities of government. But
religious beliefs are not the law of the land _ not in the United
States of America.
</P>
<P>
   No president or governor, no official at any level of government
in America, should make decisions based on the desires or dictates
of any church. That is the law of the land.
