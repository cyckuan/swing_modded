 &HT;    Amnesty International issues a scathing report on Texas'
clemency system

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Amnesty International, an anti-death penalty
group that monitors abuses of justice around the world, says in a
new report that Texas' secretive clemency process for condemned
criminals violates minimum safeguards for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The organization usually reserves such criticism for overseas
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a jurisdiction that executes more people than any other in
the Western World, Texas has turned the final safeguard of
executive clemency into nothing more than an empty gesture,''
according to a report the group released Tuesday. Texas is one of
38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles _ which recommends to the
governor whether to commute sentences to life in prison or grant
temporary reprieves _ has been widely criticized in recent months
for not thoroughly reviewing cases, not holding meetings and not
conducting its business in public. The board has granted clemency
only once in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, the Amnesty International report said, ``violates
minimum human rights safeguards by failing to provide any genuine
opportunity for death row inmates to seek and obtain the reduction
of their sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the 18-member parole board ,
dismissed the criticism as unfounded and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amnesty International is against the death penalty, so their
conclusions are not surprising in the least,'' he said. ``The
standard in this country that guides us for fairness and equity is
constitutionality. Texas has a fair and constitutional system, and
the courts repeatedly have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the report Tuesday, Gov. George W. Bush, who
appoints the parole board members, said the clemency system has
withstood court challenge. ``The courts have looked at it. It's
fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he believes the report is timed to coincide with
an orchestrated protest over the scheduled June 17 execution of
Joseph Stanley Faulder, twice convicted of murdering an East Texas
woman during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty International report noted that the U.S. Supreme
Court affirmed the need for a meaningful clemency process when it
re-approved capital punishment in 1976. The organization contends
Texas' system falls far short of what the high court had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from serving as the fail-safe mechanism envisaged by the
U.S. Supreme Court, the Texas (Board of Pardons and Paroles) had
become something akin to a hostile and secretive agency interested
only in preserving the illusion of meaningful clemency review,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites several cases, including Houston pickax killer
Karla Faye Tucker. She was unanimously rejected for clemency even
though supporters insisted she was a born-again Christian who no
longer posed a threat to society. Although the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals rejected her court challenge, a dissenting opinion
from Judge Morris Overstreet described the clemency process as
``totally inadequate'' and ``a legal fiction at best,'' because the
overwhelming majority of petitions are denied.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate court challenge, Danny Lee Barber and Faulder took
the board to an Austin federal court last December where testimony
revealed that only a handful of 4,000 letters in support of
Faulder's clemency were forwarded to board members; some board
members had little or no memory of the case they had decided amid a
flurry of publicity; and board members do not meet to decide cases.
They review the files privately and vote by telephone and fax
machine. Although U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks upheld the
constitutionality of Texas' clemency system, he sharply criticized
it. ``A flip of the coin would be more merciful than these votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the criticisms are misplaced. He said the board
recently has changed its rules to give members more time to review
filings and to allow convicts face-to-face meetings with board
members. Mark Warren, a coordinator in Amnesty International's
Canadian section who helped compile the report, said he hopes the
report's conclusions do not go unheeded. At present, he said,
Texas' clemency process offers little public assurance that someone
will be executed who should not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That safety net is in tatters now,'' he said.
