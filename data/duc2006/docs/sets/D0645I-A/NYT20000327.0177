   WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing
prosperity, many of the working poor have become worse off because
affordable housing is harder for them to find, a federal report
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of
housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income
families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in
dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic
expansion began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have
been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his
department's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available
because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is
being knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor
were caused by several factors, including the rising economy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose
rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher
program known as Section 8. But because of the nation's rising
prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that
higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments
beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve
additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went
out of the housing business.'' He blamed the Republicans in
Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had
proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress
said zero.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing
vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved
by Congress in a four-year period, but he said that there were good
reasons for that .
</P>
<P>
   A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one,
take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any
families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them.
