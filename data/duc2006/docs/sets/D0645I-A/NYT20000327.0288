   WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing
prosperity, affordable housing for many of the working poor has
become harder to find, a federal report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of
housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income
families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in
dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic
expansion began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The government regards housing for low-income people affordable
if does not consume more than a third of a family's income.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have
been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his
department's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available
because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is
being knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor
were caused by several factors, including the rising economy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose
rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher
program known as Section 8. But because of the nation's rising
prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that
higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments
beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve
additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went
out of the housing business.'' He blamed the Republicans in
Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had
proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress
said zero.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing
vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved
by Congress in the four-year period, but he said that there were
good reasons for that .
</P>
<P>
   A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one,
take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any
families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' complaints were satisfied, Lazio said, and
Congress approved 50,000 new housing vouchers in 1999 and 60,000
more last year.
</P>
<P>
   As to Clinton's request for 120,000 more this year, Lazio said,
``I support the additional use of vouchers, but it is incumbent on
us to be responsible in paying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had introduced a measure calling for 100,000
units, ``so we are very close.'' He said that the Clinton
administration had to show where the money would come from and not
resort to budget ``gimmicks'' to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the additional 120,000 housing vouchers, which
would cost $6 billion, would help ease the ``cruel irony'' of the
strong economy hurting the poor by driving up rents. ``Many people
are being left behind and they need help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his own department, which has jurisdiction over
housing, should not share in the blame for the shortage, Cuomo
said, ``If there was any failure, it was our failure to persuade
Congress to provide funds.''
