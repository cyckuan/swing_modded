 &HT;    HUD INCREASES RENTAL SUBSIDIES IN ATLANTA AREA
 &HT;    By MEGAN K. DOYLE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew
Cuomo announced a boost in subsidies for low-income renters in 39
metropolitan areas Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100
million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing
available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the booming economy is creating a ``housing crisis''
leaving 5.4 million low-income families paying more than half of
their income for housing. Rental rates have risen at one and a half
times the rate of inflation in the past three years, according to
HUD's State of the Cities 2000 report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat counter-intuitive, but it is the successful
economy that is actually creating this problem for us,'' Cuomo
said. ``We have more people in need of affordable housing than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal assistance vouchers allow most recipients to pay no
more than 30 percent of their income towards their rent, with the
government providing the rest, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which Cuomo said can be initiated using money
currently available, would add 1.4 million additional units
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   However, any housing agency nationwide that can demonstrate
difficulties obtaining rental units through vouchers could be
eligible for the increased subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2001,
which is scheduled to be reviewed by the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday, calls for 120,000 new vouchers and a new
$50 million Housing Voucher Success Fund to help families search
for available housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What promise can we make today that is better than a place to
house your family?'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a member
of the Appropriations Committee. ``We'll do whatever we can to see
the funds are there.''
</P>
<P>
   The voucher expansion comes almost simultaneously with the
announcement Monday of a new program devised by HUD through which
rental assistance vouchers can be used to purchase homes.
</P>
<P>
   The program, effective in October, allows first-time home buyers
with household incomes of at least $10,300 who are eligible for the
current rental assistance voucher program, to use the same amount
provided in rental vouchers towards payment of a home mortgage.
