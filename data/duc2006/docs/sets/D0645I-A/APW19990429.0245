	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban  
Development is taking steps to preserve thousands of federally 
subsidized housing units for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday the department will  
begin increasing payments to landlords who participate in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the payments, set years ago, are below current market  
levels, and increasing them may entice landlords to stay in the 
program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased payments will cost $30 million this fiscal year,  
HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also will continue working with Congress to draft  
a long-term, comprehensive solution to the problem, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important reform that will help protect families  
who need and deserve decent housing, at a fair cost to the American 
taxpayer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords  
agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay 
about 30 percent of their income as rent. In return, the government 
pays the difference between what the tenant pays and what the 
apartment would cost on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Landlords or HUD can end the arrangement when the contracts  
expire. Most landlords continue in the program, Cuomo said, but 
problems arise when landlords leave. The poor must either pay the 
higher rents or find new housing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next five years, two-thirds of all such contracts will  
expire, affecting nearly 14,000 properties with 1 million 
subsidized units, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 17,000 subsidized units at more than 300 properties  
left the program last year, according to a report on the issue 
released Thursday by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``project-based'' Section 8 because the subsidies are  
tied to specific rental units, the program now serves about 1.4 
million families nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another form of the housing subsidy is known as ``tenant-based''  
Section 8. Renters receive vouchers they can take with them from 
unit to unit in search of housing. This portion of the program now 
serves about 1.5 million families. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bills to address the problem are pending in Congress.
