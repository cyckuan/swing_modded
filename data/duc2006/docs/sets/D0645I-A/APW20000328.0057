<HEADLINE> Report: Poor Paying Much for Housing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The economy may be booming, but a new federal
report indicates not everyone is benefiting -- particularly the
working poor who are having an increasingly hard time finding
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, shows that a record number of working-poor families --
at least 5.4 million of them -- were paying more than half their
income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997, the
freshest figures available. That's an increase of 12 percent since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials released the report to Congress, which is
currently considering a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000
new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going so well (economically), it's hard to
imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday. ''But actually the
strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at
a rate roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest
Americans. That, in turn, is driving up rents and home prices from
San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want the city back,'' Magdalena Mendez said of
suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and
rehabbed homes just blocks from the three-unit Chicago building she
must vacate today.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is foreclosing on her landlord. So Mendez -- a
34-year-old salon assistant -- has been trying to find a
three-bedroom apartment for herself and her five children for more
than three months. She is having trouble finding anything for less
than $800 per month in the same neighborhood as her children's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's upsetting to those of us who've always worked and lived
here in the city -- who have an education, who work hard and who
still can't get what we want,'' said Mendez, who paid $350 a month
for her top-floor apartment that she figures could now rent for
$1,000 a month if it's rehabbed. That's more than she makes in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that gentrification is a new concept. But statistics
show that it is an accelerating one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class,
predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning
upscale. In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower
East Side are being converted into luxury units.
</P>
<P>
   HUD researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income
housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units
between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993.
Officials at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies
also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some
neighborhoods are trying to buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of
America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a
community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on
Chicago's North Side.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, that is more easily said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Daley administration has made it clear that their focus is
middle and upper-class people,'' Tobin said, referring to Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley. ''I think that's a pretty common attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Housing,
disputed that claim, pointing to a $4 million trust fund used to
subsidize low-income renters and their landlords.
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that, like many cities nationwide, Chicago's goal
is to create mixed-income neighborhoods, rather than having large
pockets of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what a healthy city needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mendez's ex-husband has taken custody of their
children until she finds a suitable place for them to live. She
plans to live with her two sisters while she seeks apartments and
is almost to the point where she'd take government help if it
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought I wouldn't need it. I don't want to fall into
the system or get trapped,'' said Mendez, who gets some rent help
from her ex-husband. ''But I'm not sure I have a choice anymore.''
