<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Subsidized Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers hope a bill approved by the House  
Banking Committee on Friday will counter a trend that is reducing 
the amount of government-subsidized housing available for the 
elderly and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members approved the bill unanimously in a voice vote  
and sent it for consideration to the full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the author of the bill, said the  
legislation is necessary because tens of thousands of tenants 
across the country are losing their subsidized housing -- or being 
put at risk for losing it -- as landlords drop out of the federal 
program known as ``Section 8'' to seek higher rents on the open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a period of 2 1/2 years, ending in December 1998, nearly  
100,000 units of Department of Housing and Urban Development 
housing, most of it administered under the Section 8 program for 
low-income elderly, disabled and families, have been lost, 
according to the nonprofit National Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, HUD contracts covering 1 million units -- some in every  
state -- are due to expire. About half of those units are at risk 
because their rents are below market rates, according to the trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71  
million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to 
building owners to stay in the program. One provision would forgive 
building owners' outstanding governmental loans, which would give 
nonprofit groups relief from heavy debt service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also create mixed-income senior citizen and  
disabled housing environments. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would provide incentives for building owners to convert  
government-subsidized and public housing projects to assisted 
living facilities, which provide meals, health care and other 
services to the elderly who need help with the daily activities of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision would authorize money for nonprofit  
organizations seeking to purchase, improve and preserve affordable 
federally assisted and federally insured housing for the benefit of 
low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would provide market-level vouchers so  
tenants could stay in their buildings even after the buildings have 
gone private, and would promote building sales to nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 202.
