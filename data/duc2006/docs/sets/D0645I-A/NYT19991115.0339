KERRY BILL WOULD CREATE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST

<P>
   Calling affordable housing a ``glaring need,'' Senator John
Kerry is set to announce Tuesday a sweeping legislative proposal
calling for the creation of a $2 billion-a-year National Housing
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded
by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration, would be
used to help create rental housing for low- and moderate-income
families, and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund proposal to create affordable housing is the
centerpiece of an address Kerry is scheduled to deliver Tuesday
night at the 32nd annual dinner of the Citizens' Housing and
Planning Association Inc. (CHAPA) in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Kerry's office said the senator, who is the
ranking Democrat on the Senate's housing subcommittee, will work to
build bipartisan support for the legislation to establish the trust
fund, which he expects to introduce at the next session of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, housing is the forgotten stepchild in the policy
debate at the national level,'' Kerry said in a prepared statement.
He said the federal government ``has to begin to again play a more
aggressive role in increasing (housing) supply.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, the federal government helped build an average
of 128,000 affordable housing units per year, but that number fell
to just 53,000 affordable units per year in the 1990s, according to
CHAPA.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Kerry's office noted, the declining federal commitment
has come at a time of soaring rents and real estate prices _ a
situation that is especially acute in Massachusetts _ and in the
face of a rapidly growing elderly population.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families
living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as
many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing
units, officials said. Those numbers do not include tens of
thousands of moderate-income families in need of affordable
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates Monday applauded Kerry's housing trust fund
proposal. They said his position on the Senate Housing
subcommitteee, combined with growing calls for affordable housing
from local officials, would give the proposal high visibility in
the next session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge shortage of rental housing for families and the
elderly. We need to do something to address that shortage, and this
proposal does,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive director of CHAPA,
which is one of the region's most respected nonprofit housing
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a realistic, practical proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Kerry's plan calls for creation of a new
national housing trust, set up much like the federal highway trust
fund, which would take revenues generated by the FHA and reserve
them for use exclusively in federal housing initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources and housing officials said Monday the FHA
generates about $2 billion annually from insurance guarantees it
provides as one of the nation's largest mutual mortgage funds, and
from related sources.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday the $2 billion was in excess of reserves
the FHA is required to set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The money currently goes into the nation's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to an outline of the proposal, many of the legislative
efforts would be directed toward helping local and state
governments build affordable housing and boost the rate of
homeownership through an array of existing, but underfunded,
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing
Studies at Harvard University and a former head of the FHA, said
Kerry's proposal was a ``noteworthy'' way of addressing the
shortage of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to find ways to give more resources to this
problem. It's a growing problem, and it's not going to go away,''
Retsinas said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kerry's proposal, the housing trust fund would be used to
expand rental housing for families, preserve and renovate existing
affordable housing, and increase subsidized housing and assisted
living for elderly, whose numbers are expected to grow dramatically
in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is also calling for more aid to low-income and first-time
home buyers through a program of tax credits to investors in
below-market second mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Another would allow home buyers to use IRAs for down payments on
homes.
