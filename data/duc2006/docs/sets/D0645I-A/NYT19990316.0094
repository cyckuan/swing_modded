   BOSTON -- They have wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   Housing activist Bruce Marks wants Fleet Financial Group to sell
some of the branches it will be required to divest to a national
lender, which will keep the hometown bank competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our basic feeling that this is like a couple of feudal
lords getting together,'' Marks, executive director of the
Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph E. Washington, chairman of the Boston-based
Organization for a New Equality, wants Fleet to increase its
lending to minority small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Draisen, who heads a statewide group for community
development corporations, wants Fleet to convert into equity part
of the estimated $200 million in loans it will have to pledge, as
part of the merger, to a low-income housing program.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the merger mating game: Where housing and community
activists are handed leverage the likes of which they rarely see.
</P>
<P>
   Banks like Fleet, mindful that staunch community opposition has
the potential to delay their deals and create regulatory headaches,
take these demands seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a merger in the insurance world, or of phone
companies, they would not be talking to community groups,'' said
Thomas Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable
Housing Alliance, a nonprofit group whose low-income home loan
program is underwritten by nine area banks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, banks are required to
make sure they loan money to residents of low-income and minority
neighborhoods in which they do business. Each year banks receive a
rating from federal regulators for their CRA performance; most,
including Fleet and BankBoston, receive high marks. But when
regulators start reviewing the fine print of a merger application,
community support or opposition takes on added significance. And
getting local groups onboard early can influence regulators'
decisions of whether or not to dispense with public hearings on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet knows well the sting of bad local publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, a former Fleet subsidiary was accused of
engaging in unscrupulous lending practices in poor and minority
communities. After a 4 1/2-year battle with Marks, and a
multimillion-dollar settlement, Fleet agreed to earmark more than
$7.6 billion over three years to low-income customers and
affordable housing initiatives nationally. The agreements were
inked shortly before Fleet's merger with Shawmut National Corp.
Indeed, a major beneficiary of Fleet's new initiative, dubbed
``InCity,'' was a burgeoning affordable housing program run by
Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that largesse, housing activists worry that one less
major bank in Boston will reduce the overall amount of CRA spending
locally. Fleet and BankBoston together have spent hundreds of
millions of dollars trying to comply with the CRA to gain community
support. Fleet spent $151.5 million in Massachusetts on
specially-targeted CRA mortgage programs last year, while
BankBoston spent about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent round of dealmaking has only begun.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for an attractive set of ``commitments,'' Draisen
said, local groups might offer Fleet their neutrality before
regulators. ``We will be holding meetings across the state with
CDCs and other allies to try and come up with a list of critical
requests,'' Draisen said.
