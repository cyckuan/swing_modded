 &HT;    Low-income housing on increase, study showsBy Rebecca Carr

<P>
   Washington _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income
households has steadily increased over the last two decades as the
pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of
national housing needs released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number
of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or
less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin
in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle
between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their
children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the
social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen
Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   About the only housing program that seems to win new money from
Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting
that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for
low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress
and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has requested 103,000 new rental
assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain
if Congress will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating
the request has granted approval of a 8,000 such vouchers, but the
House has yet to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than
$6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study.
``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a
distance at the economic prosperity benefitting most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the rental voucher program say the federal
government should not be in the housing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house
reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory
studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington D.C. think
tank. ``I would get the federal government out of the housing
business. It has no consitutional authority to provide federal
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick A. Lazio, (R-NY.), the chairman of the House
subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, cautioned that
``more funding for bad programs is not the solution.'' He noted
that the federal government has more than doubled spending on
programs to aid the homeless, but it has had little impact.
``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve
more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's point person on housing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates say the situation is dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider
and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare a housing policy analyst.
``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such
prosperous economic times.''
</P>
<P>
   Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight out of every 10 renters below the federal poverty line
face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the
level of affordability for federal housing established in 1981
under President Reagan's Administration.
</P>
<P>
   _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of
their income on rent and utilities in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent
more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every
low-cost unit. In the West there are closer to three low-income
renters for each unit.
