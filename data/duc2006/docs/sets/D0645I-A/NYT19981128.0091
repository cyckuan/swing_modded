U.S. BOLSTERS HOUSING AID FOR THE ELDERLY

   WASHINGTON _ With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President
Clinton highlighted two new housing programs Saturday that would
provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that the money would
benefit 29,400 people living in 48 states, and the District of
Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Montana and North Dakota, sparsely
populated states, are the only two that are not slated to receive
any of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of struggling senior citizens and people with
disabilities, the peace and security of a decent home is a distant
dream and the threat of homelessness an ever-present nightmare,''
Clinton said, discussing the programs, which are included in the
new budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
``Too many of these hard-pressed Americans are warehoused in
sterile nursing homes _ not because they need to be, but because
they can't afford to live anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Americans should never have to choose between
putting a meal on the table or putting a roof over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's $25 billion housing budget for the 1999
fiscal year was one of the few appropriation requests that met with
little opposition in the Republican-led Congress this year. It
included $1.8 billion in new spending for vouchers, which reflected
the first major increase in housing spending in four years and also
the department's efforts to rid itself of wasteful programs and
mismanagement that characterized it in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of the programs Clinton cited in his radio address
generates $696 million in grants to nonprofit organizations around
the country to build and rehabilitate 8,200 apartment units for
older people and the disabled who fall below certain income levels.
</P>
<P>
   The second program will provide an additional $126.8 million to
be distributed among disabled people in the form of rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials predict that the new apartments will
accommodate 12,400 people through projects managed by 166 private
groups that competed for the grants. The money will cover
development costs and does not have to be repaid so long as the new
housing is available for 40 years to low-income elderly residents
or people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   More money is available to the project owner to cover
differences between the rent and operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those receiving the assistance must be classified as ``very low
income,'' which means that a household cannot earn more than 50
percent of the area's median income. On a national average,
administration officials say that amounts to less than $8,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for
more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their
rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a priority for the president,'' Andrew
Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting older, not only individually, but as a
society, and the numbers are alarming,'' Cuomo said. ``The graying
of America is going to have significant impact on the nation's
housing and will be one of the greatest challenges we face over the
next 10 years.''
</P>

<P>
   The country now has about 34 million citizens 65 or older,
compared with about 3 million at the turn of the 20th century.
Cuomo said that the figure was expected to reach 53 million within
25 years, putting additional strain on the need for affordable
units.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cuomo said, the department and the private
organizations that are building new units are redesigning them with
older and disabled people in mind, focusing on communal facilities
for health and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite the benefits most Americans are
accruing through the prosperous economy, too many elderly and
disabled people ``are trapped in substandard housing, where broken
plumbing, inadequate heat and hazardous hallways are a dangerous
fact of life. And too many spend more than half of their modest
incomes on housing, often sacrificing basic needs like food and
medical care just to pay the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting the administration's efforts, he added, ``At this
moment of unparalleled prosperity, we must not do less.''
