CLINTON PLANS NEW VOUCHERS FOR WORKING-CLASS HOUSING

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing
vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he
will send to Congress in February, administration officials said
Tuesday. It would amount to the largest expansion of the housing
program in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own
housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs.
Congressional Republicans have been reluctant to finance the
program at the levels requested by the president in recent years,
resulting in a large backlog in applicants. After Clinton proposed
money for 100,000 vouchers this year, Congress eventually approved
60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 1.4 million families receive such housing vouchers.
But a report prepared by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in March 1999 found that the number of families waiting
for such assistance had increased to 600,000. The wait for vouchers
has stretched to 10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, seven years in
Houston and five years in Chicago and Memphis, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the president's proposed expansion, which will cost
$690 million, is designed to address a paradox of the current
economic expansion. At the same time that the strong national
economy is making many Americans rich, it is hurting millions of
the nation's poorest people by making affordable housing more
difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the greatest need for affordable housing in history,''
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday in an interview. ``The
strong economy is driving up rents. This is the most aggressive
housing budget of his administration. It is the largest request of
the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton would include in his budget a
package of vouchers intended for individuals who are moving from
welfare to work, homeless people, those with large families and
working-class families designated by local housing authorities. All
recipients would have to meet strict income requirements, about
$27,900 per family nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as an important part of the overall strategy of
supporting working families,'' an aide to Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will deliver the broad outlines of his budget on
Jan. 27 at his final State of the Union address. On Feb. 7, he will
send the document to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Housing experts say the voucher program has grown steadily from
1978 until 1995, when congressional Republicans stopped further
expansions because of concerns about the management of the money.
Since then, there have been only two moderate increases.
</P>
<P>
   One key Republican lawmaker said the key question is how Clinton
intends to finance the new vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly support additional vouchers, provided that the
president can find an acceptable way to pay for them,'' said Rep.
Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, chairman of the House housing
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers continue to be sought-after commodities that can
take years to obtain. The average subsidy, aides said, is about
$400 a month. The tenant kicks in $223 a month, to cover an average
rent of $623.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many low-income families don't live near where their jobs are
and this program allows them to move closer,'' a White House
official said. ``Housing is expensive and it's hard to find. This
program allows them to fill in the gap.''
