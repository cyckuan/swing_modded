<HEADLINE> National Homeownership Soars </HEADLINE>

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Fueled by the lowest mortgage interest  
and unemployment rates since the 1960s, national homeownership 
soared in 1998 and probably will continue increasing for the next 
decade, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of housing in America is very, very good,'' said  
Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for 
Housing Studies, which was releasing the study today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that about 1.8 million homes have been built  
each year since 1996, and that the national homeownership rate 
reached 66.3 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the  
South and the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that increases in immigration and in the number  
of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase 
in the housing market for the next decade. At the same time, baby 
boomers becoming senior citizens are expected to help sustain the 
home remodeling market as they revamp their homes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, the housing boom hasn't done much for  
minorities and the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although more minorities are buying homes because of low  
interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs, the 
gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened from 1994 to 
1998, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Education is a factor in that gap. For minorities, the  
likelihood of becoming a homeowner increases dramatically with the 
completion of a bachelor's degree, Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the report says, the brisk housing market has also  
driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor 
and those newly off of welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable  
housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 
percent of their income as rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For no state in the nation could a household with one person  
making $7 per hour working 52 weeks a year be able to pay for a 
two-bedroom apartment without exceeding the 
30-percent-of-their-income standard,'' Retsinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Housing policy has been predicated on the premise that if you  
work, you will be able to afford housing,'' he added. ``The whole 
housing policy is brought into question.''
