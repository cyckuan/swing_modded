<HEADLINE> Report: Poor Paying Much for Housing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer

   CHICAGO (AP) -- With the bank foreclosing on her landlord's
building, Magdalena Mendez needs to find an apartment for herself
and her five children -- fast. But the Chicago salon assistant is
having a hard time finding what she wants: a three-bedroom for less
than $800 a month in the same neighborhood as her children's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. A federal report released Monday shows that a
record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million --
were paying more than half their income for housing or living in
substandard conditions in 1997, the freshest figures available.
That's an increase of 12 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being presented to Congress, which is considering
a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance
vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is going so well (economically), it's hard to
imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday.
''But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a
lack of affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development officials said incomes for average
Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30 percent greater than
incomes for the poorest Americans. That, in turn, is driving up
rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want the city back,'' Mendez said of suburbanites and
others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabilitated
homes just blocks from the three-unit building she must leave
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's upsetting to those of us who've always worked and lived
here in the city -- who have an education, who work hard and who
still can't get what we want,'' said Mendez, a 34-year-old Chicago
native who paid $350 a month for her top-floor apartment in that
building. She figures it could now rent for $1,000 a month if it's
rehabbed, and that's more than she makes in a month.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that gentrification is a new concept. But statistics
show that it is an accelerating one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class,
predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning
upscale. In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower
East Side are being converted into luxury units.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers have found that the nation is losing
low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000
units between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and
1993. Officials at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing
Studies also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some
neighborhoods are trying to buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of
America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a
community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on
Chicago's far North Side.
