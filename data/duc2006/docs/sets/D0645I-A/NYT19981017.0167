   MILL CREEK, Wash. _ With the Seattle job market strong and the
housing market tight, the Housing Authority in next-door Snohomish
County has moved away from its traditional role and become a
builder, on a break-even basis, of for-sale housing for
moderate-income working families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty manufactured houses on a five-acre site called Thomas
Place will be sold this fall to first-time buyers whose households
earn from $25,000 to $60,000 a year. Median income for a family of
four in the county is $59,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average price of new houses constructed in the county by
private builders in the '90s is $193,960, an indication that
younger buyers are for the most part forced out of the market.
Three-bedroom houses in Thomas Place sell for $63,800,
four-bedrooms for $79,750. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to
produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of
government subsides. The agency owns more than 1,200 units of low-
and moderate-income housing and offers rent subsidies in 1,900
additional units.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But with the disappearance of federal money to build new low-
and moderate-income housing, local governments have asked housing
agencies to create home-ownership programs for working people in
need of housing, said Robert Davis, executive director of the
Snohomish County Housing Authority. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well organized, solvent and have the construction and
financing expertise to do this,'' Davis said. ``We are not taking
anything away from the other services we provide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority is not alone among other such agencies
searching for ways to produce housing without federal subsidies.
``Because the federal government has stopped funding new affordable
housing, local agencies are finding other ways to meet their
needs,'' said Richard Y. Nelson Jr., executive director of the
National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Springs, Colo., Housing Authority will complete
construction in six weeks of 20 town houses that it is financing.
``We're ready to sign contracts with six first-time buyers and we
are screening 100 applications to buy the remaining 14 homes,''
says Richard Sullivan, executive director of the authority.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Qualified buyers are families earning 60 to 80 percent of the
city's median income. The 80 percent figure is $36,650.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages are financed through the Colorado Housing Finance
Authority, which requires just a $1,000 down payment on a house.
Two 30-year mortgages are offered to qualified buyers to cover the
cost of a house _ one for 75 percent of the cost at 5.4 percent by
the finance agency, the other for 25 percent of the cost at 1.5
percent by the Colorado Springs Housing authority.
</P>
<P>
   A two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot house costs $98,000 and a
2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom house $104,000, compared to the
market range of $115,000 to $125,000. A homeowners' association
will hold the land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County, Md., a densely built suburban county
adjacent to Washington, D.C., developers are granted greater
density in exchange for setting aside 15 percent of the housing
units in a project for moderate-income families at below-market
rents or sale prices. The Housing Authority then buys a third of
the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   At Thomas Place, close to Mill Creek and about 20 minutes north
of downtown Seattle on Interstate 5, there were more than 250
applications to buy the dwellings within days after models opened
in mid-August. The energy-efficient models, ranging in size from
1,080 to 1,400 square feet, had two-car carports or garages, high
vaulted ceilings, French doors, wood exterior siding, oak cabinets
in the kitchen and an oval tub in the master-bedroom suite. ``This
interest exceeds our wildest expectation,'' said Ann Schroeder
Osterberg, the Housing Authority's director of corporate planning.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers need a $2,500 down payment, for which the Housing
Authority provides assistance to its lowest-income buyers at 2
percent interest and the Washington Manufactured Housing
Association will give five new owners whose income is 50 percent or
less of the median grants up to $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   To build as many dwellings as possible, the houses fill most of
the lots, which range in size from 2,800 to 5,300 square feet, with
only five-foot spaces between the houses and ``postage stamp''
backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the rundown Thomas Lake Mobile Home Park
occupied a corner of the property. Occupants were in danger of
losing their housing because septic and water systems were failing.
The Housing Authority acquired the land and brought in emergency
services. The trailer park will be phased out as occupants move,
and nine of the 50 units will be built there.
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority will continue to own the property and is
charging a monthly land lease of $295 for the lots ranging in size
from 2,800 square feet to 5,300 square feet. The money will be
returned to Thomas Place to pay for water and sewers, garbage
pickup, roads, street lights, landscaping and a resident manager's
salary.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A home buyer's total monthly costs will be between $700 to $900,
including the monthly land lease, compared to an average of $900
and up to rent a three-bedroom unit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Place will cost the Housing Authority about $5 million
when developed. Some $1.1 million from the Washington State Housing
Trust Fund, which offers grants and loans to public and nonprofit
agencies to develop low-income housing, and the federal Community
Development Block Grant will go toward buying the property for
$360,000 and renovating the trailer park and infrastructure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seafirst Bank, a Bank of America subsidiary, provided a line of
credit to finance infrastructure. The Housing Authority issued $1
million in bonds to repay this loan. In addition, it issued $2.9
million in revenue bonds and sold them to private investors.
</P>
<P>
   This created the pool for mortgages that the Housing Authority
provides at 7.012 percent fixed interest for 30 years, a rate
comparable to that charged for traditional ``stick-built'' housing.
Buyers must have stable employment and not be saddled with
excessive debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new owners will have an easy 20-minute commute south into
Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond, home of companies such as Microsoft,
or to Everett to the north where Boeing operates a jet assembly
plant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish housing agency had previously constructed on
various sites about a dozen houses that it sold to residents
earning about 80 percent of the county's median income. But, said
Ms. Schroeder Osterberg, ``we concluded this was the expensive way
to go.'' Manufactured homes cost about one third less ``and
provided us with a more affordable product.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Place homes built by Moduline Industries of Chehalis,
Wash., bear little resemblance to the wide, metal-sided,
interior-paneled homes of the past, says Joan Brown, executive
director of the Washington Manufactured Housing Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had major advances, the industry has stepped up to the
energy issue and when a manufacturer says to Maytag `I need 10,000
dishwashers,' the company can cut a pretty good price,'' said Mrs.
Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that ``based on the incredible success'' of Thomas
Place, providing two-story manufactured homes for working people
will be his next step ``so we can get the best property density.''
But, he added, ``it is a couple of years away, the land use process
takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Puget Sound from Seattle, the Kitsap County Consolidated
Housing Authority plans to build several hundred manufactured
homes, mostly on land it owns near Bremerton that is platted for
250 houses. It will retain land ownership so home buyers can avoid
the expense of property taxes.
