   BOSTON _ In the midst of an economic and real estate boom, many
low- and moderate-income residents are struggling to find and keep
a place to live, according to a study being touted as the first
comprehensive examination in more than a decade on the state of
housing in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the University of Massachusetts' Donahue
Institute, concludes that one out of every four households in
Massachusetts _ renters and homeowners alike _ are contending with
a ``severe housing affordability problem,'' with a number facing
homelessness, eviction or foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first statewide study on housing that has been
done in more than decade,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive
director of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association,which
sponsored the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report's focus is on people like Theresa Shenett, who
wonders whether she will soon be spending the holidays in a
homeless shelter. Shenett is now waiting for a judge to decide
whether her landlord may evict her from a one-bedroom Jamaica Plain
apartment she shares with her son and a relative. ``It's taken away
all the spirit of Christmas,'' Shenett said during a recent
interview, tears on her tired face.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and
policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with
steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mostly working people, they have jobs, but the jobs
aren't paying enough for them to pay for the cost of housing,''
said Michael Stone, a professor at UMass Boston, and one of the
authors of the study. ``Prosperity on the one hand tends to mask
the plight of many, many people, not just poor people but
middle-income people who aren't sharing in the prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding affordable housing has also been made more difficult by
the fact that a number of apartment owners have sold their
properties as condos, taking advantage of the strong real estate
market.
</P>
<P>
   Facing higher rents, increasing numbers of lower- and
middle-income residents have found themselves unable to pay their
rents. According to the study, evictions increased by 64 percent
from 1993 to 1997, and the state also has experienced a 100 percent
increase in the number of homeless families since 1990. The authors
contend that about 10,000 families in Massachusetts live in
shelters or on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest level of homelessness that we've had ever,''
said Philip Mangano, executive director of the Massachusetts
Housing and Shelter Alliance. ``The demand for homeless programs in
general is greater than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who've managed to hold on to their homes are having a
tough time making ends meet, the study found, characterizing about
36 percent of all renters in the state as ``shelter poor,'' meaning
they can't really afford the amount they pay for housing, based on
their total income and expenses. The study also found that while
minority home buying has helped to push the state's homeownership
rate to about 62.3 percent, minority mortgage applicants still face
rampant discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, denial rates for black and Latino applicants were 53
percent and 38 percent, while the denial rate for whites was just
26 percent. Moreover, upper-income black and Latino applicants were
denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Today's predicament in housing differs significantly from that
of the 1980s, when the state's housing market experienced a similar
upturn, housing advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a number of afforable housing units compared to the
1980s...and we've seen significant cutbacks in goverment funding
for housing programs during that time,'' Gornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of about 22 percent of the state's rental housing
stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy. About 16
percent of those units are operated by state or local housing
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   With many developers eyeing a newly attractive rental market,
especially in Boston and the close-in suburbs, local officials are
doing what they can to try and maintain what remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough market and the traditional ways to finance
housing don't exist anymore,'' said Pat Canavan, housing policy
advisor to Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Those most vulnerable in today's tight rental market include
single mothers, the elderly, immigrants, and the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Brighton, Manuel Velasquez, his wife and three children
scrape to stay in a cramped two-bedroom apartment they share with
an army of cockroaches and the occasional mouse. Velasquez, who
works as a janitor and parking lot attendant, wonders where in the
world they will go if they have to leave their $550 a month home.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Elsa Ruano, a 51-year old widow, waits as she has
since 1992 for her name to rise to the top of a waiting list for
public housing. She rents out three bedrooms in her three-bedroom
apartment to scrape together $650-a-month. Recently, the landlord
tried to hike Ruano's rent to $1,400, a move thwarted for now
through the efforts of a local community activist.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors say it underscores the need for the state to
devise more creative ways of coping with a problem they predict
will only get worse. Among the initiatives CHAPA's Gornstein would
like to see adopted: a measure that would fast-track the process
that allows cities and towns to seize abandoned homes for use as
affordable housing; and a $4 million a year state tax credit that
would give investors tax incentives for backing the development of
low-income projects.
</P>
<P>
   However, within the Cellucci administration, the report received
a rather frosty reception. ``We weren't overly surprised by the
information,'' said Eric Gedstad, spokesman for the Department of
Housing and Community Development. Gedstad said the state spends
$300 million a year on affordable housing.
