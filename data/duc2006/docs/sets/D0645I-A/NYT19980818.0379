U.S. PLAN WOULD SHIFT MORE WORKING FAMILIES INTO PUBLIC HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and the Clinton
administration are very close to agreement on legislation that
would allow public housing authorities to put more working families
into apartments that in recent years have been reserved almost
exclusively for the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been sought by officials in many cities who
contend that large concentrations of extremely poor people in
public housing projects have shattered neighborhoods, sapped their
commercial vitality and left them devoid of stable families.
</P>
<P>
   For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would
free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year
for families making as much as $40,000 a year. The city's housing
authority considers the bill a necessary first step toward creating
a marketing strategy designed to encourage higher income families
to move into its housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities
greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million
public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over
poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use
federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
</P>
<P>
   The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional
Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the
Republican bill would leave poor people without housing. But Cuomo
has negotiated changes in the bill that have made it acceptable to
many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other
housing measures that are likely to make it easier for
congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept
the public housing bill.
</P>
<P>
   One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers,
which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. If
approved, the increase would be the first in about five years.
Nearly 3 million households now receive housing vouchers. The
second would make federally insured mortgages available to at least
17,000 more home buyers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though both of those measures would make relatively small
increases in public housing resources, Cuomo contends they are
important because the Republican-controlled Congress has
perennially talked of cutting housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for housing authorities said the bill also includes a
provision sought by several cities, including Los Angeles and
Chicago, that would make it easier to demolish aging projects. And
housing officials across the country are pushing for the
legislation because they contend it will help them bring teachers,
municipal workers and other low-income working families into
projects. &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are trying to entice the public to come back to public
housing,'' said George McQuade, a spokesman for the Los Angeles
city Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has historically had a much more broader mix of
income groups in public housing than other large cities, and
housing experts say that diversity has helped make the city's
projects more livable than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But New York officials say that federal rules favoring the very
poor have caused the percentage of working families in the city's
public housing to plummet from half of all tenant households in
1983 to a third today. They contend that if the rules are not
changed, the city's projects will become bastions of deep poverty,
causing the kinds of problems that plague the nation's most
notorious housing systems, like those in Chicago and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public housing was never intended to be an enclave for the
very, very poor,'' said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the New York
City Housing Authority, the nation's largest, with nearly 600,000
tenants. ``Historically, the public housing population reflected
the diversity of the communities, with people who carried lunch
pails, who were role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the 400-page public housing bill have reached a
delicate stage, with a number of thorny details still to be
resolved. But those involved in the talks expressed guarded
optimism late last week that the remaining differences would be
resolved and that a bill would reach the president's desk in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I say it is a certainty? No,'' said Cuomo. ``Am I
cautiously optimistic? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislation would make some of the largest changes
to federal housing policy in many years, the negotiations have
often bogged down over political and symbolic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the proposed changes would represent a
philosophical sea change in federal policy, moving away from
decades-old requirements that housing authorities focus their
resources almost entirely on the poorest of the poor. They contend
the bill would also provide incentives for tenants to find work and
buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that the perception of housing authorities will be
restored to where it was in the '30s and '40s: a place where people
were proud to live,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the
House subcommittee on housing and community development and the
lead House negotiator. ``Where you had teachers, policeman and city
workers living alongside people with no income.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, led by Cuomo, and groups representing public
housing tenants have fought to preserve protections for the very
poor, including a requirement that housing authorities provide a
minimum number of units for the very poor and maximum limits on
rents. Cuomo had argued that an earlier draft of the House bill
would have left 1.8 million senior citizens and children without
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Many housing experts said that the compromise now taking shape
calls for narrowly drafted changes that could meet the political
needs of both sides. On the thorniest issue, for instance _ how to
bring more working families into public housing _ the proposed
changes would pare back federal requirements for housing the very
poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes would be incremental enough that they probably
would not be noticed for years because turnover in most housing
authorities is low and waiting lists are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see any swift changes in composition,''
said Richard Nelson, executive director of the National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the compromises, some advocates for the poor say the
housing bill would still hurt very low-income families because it
would reduce the number of units available to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor folks would almost never have an opportunity to get into
public housing if the current provisions are passed,'' warned Ed
Williams, a founder of the New York City Public Housing Resident
Alliance, a tenant advocacy group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current federal rules strictly limit the number of vacant
apartments a housing authority can rent to the working poor,
defined as families earning more than 50 percent of a region's
median annual income. In New York City, the limit is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has also required housing authorities to
give preference to the homeless, people spending more than half
their income on rent, victims of domestic violence and people
displaced by government action. Those preferences were suspended
last year, but remain on the books.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill is expected to abolish the federal
preferences, allow local housing authorities to set their own
preferences and increase the number of units available to working
families by between 5 and 10 percent a year, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not change current eligibility rules, under which
public housing is available only to people earning less than 80
percent of a region's median income.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New
York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units
for higher income families provided they exceeded federal
requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is also pushing a provision that would require housing
authorities to integrate higher income tenants into the lowest
income projects, to prevent authorities from segregating the
poorest tenants in the worst buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the bill will probably repeal a requirement
that links rent increases to increases in income, a rule that
Republicans say discourages people from working.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more contentious unresolved issues involves a
proposal by Lazio to allow mayors or county executives to assume
direct control of poorly run housing authorities, upon the
permission of the housing secretary. Housing officials and Cuomo
strongly oppose the idea, and are pushing a plan that would
restrict such takeovers to only the most troubled authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that has not been clearly resolved involves a
proposal to allow tenants in family housing projects to own pets.
New York City and other large housing authorities object to the
proposal, warning that vicious dogs could terrorize tenants and
housing police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the bill was likely to leave the issue in the
hands of local housing authorities. But many housing officials
oppose that idea because they fear that political pressure from pet
owners will force them to allow pets in projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the negotiations have been complicated by
the fiercely competitive relationships entangling three of the
major players, all New Yorkers: Cuomo, Lazio and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, chairman of the Senate banking committee, which oversees
housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Lazio are considered potential rivals for the seat of
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan if he chooses not to run in 2000.
D'Amato is responsible for helping to unseat Cuomo's father, Gov.
Mario Cuomo, in 1994. And D'Amato is widely thought to consider
Lazio an overly aggressive upstart from his political backyard of
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tensions with Lazio, some officials said, D'Amato,
who traditionally has been very active in shaping housing
legislation, has ceded responsibility over negotiations to Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee on
housing and community development.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to all three New Yorkers said their personal relationships
had no impact on the housing negotiations.
