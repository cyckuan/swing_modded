CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS AGREE TO CREATE MORE RENT SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Senate and House negotiators reached agreement
Monday on a bill that would make rent subsidies available to more
poor families and allow more home buyers to qualify for federally
backed mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which seems assured of passage by Congress and of
President Clinton's signature, would create about 90,000 Section 8
vouchers, or federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. It
would also raise the loan limits on federally insured mortgages to
$197,621 from $170,362.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts HUD back in the housing business,'' Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that both the rental-subsidy provision and the higher
ceiling for mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration
would have wide impact in New York City and other metropolitan
areas, where there are long waiting lists for housing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the creation of 90,000 rental vouchers was especially
important, because no new Section 8 vouchers have been authorized
since 1994. Nearly three million households now receive housing
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, HUD negotiators had thought they might
persuade lawmakers to authorize 15,000 new vouchers. Authorization
of the far higher number left housing officials ``ecstatic,'' as
one put it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the higher mortgage ceiling would benefit about
70,000 families, many of them members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the HUD portion passes more or less intact, the
housing agency's funds for the fiscal year that began last Thursday
would increase about $2 billion, to $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had pushed for measures to prevent housing agencies
from separating working families from the very poor, and thus
fostering racial as well as economic segregation. Republicans had
pushed for measures to help the working poor who live in public
housing. Cuomo, saying the bill met both needs, praised negotiators
from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the Banking Committee's
housing subcommittee, said the House Republican leadership had
eased the way for the bill by combining it with the appropriations
bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
