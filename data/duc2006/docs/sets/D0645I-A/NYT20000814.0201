&HT;     LAZIO TOUTS HOUSING POLICY IN CONTEST WITH FIRST LADY

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His campaign for the U.S. Senate was still in its
infancy and Rep. Rick Lazio needed to show that he, too, could make
serious policy speeches on the hustings _ a favorite tactic of his
Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So the four-term Republican congressman from Long Island turned
to his pet project _ public housing _ while speaking to a crowd of
municipal leaders in Saratoga Springs in June. It was not a
particularly exciting topic, and several in the crowd fell asleep
during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But it highlighted Lazio's mainstay in Congress since 1994, an
area of expertise rarely associated with Republicans, in which he
is widely credited with working on both sides of the political
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton challenges the effectiveness and outcomes of Lazio's
work on public housing and welfare reform. Some of the mandates to
come out of the Republican-led Congress _ and, particularly, out of
the House Banking and Financial Services' housing subcommittee that
Lazio chairs _ are described by the first lady's campaign as
``draconian'' measures that would eliminate public housing for some
of America's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   In his first campaign policy speech _ and one of the only ones _
Lazio envisioned publicly financed communities of people with
diverse incomes. He also spoke enthusiastically about giving states
more power over federal aid, a familiar Republican theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who are working next to people who aren't
working,'' Lazio said. ``We don't want to concentrate poverty.
That's a failed formula of the past, the concentration of poverty,
in some cases the super-concentration of poverty. These are the
things we should be looking at in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe in a strong federal partnership on housing
and economic development _ I believe we should be there. ... I just
don't believe we should micro-manage every decision for the local
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after two years of work on the idea, Lazio successfully
pushed through Congress revisions to the nation's public housing
law, which had not been substantially updated since 1937. The law,
hailed as one of the Republicans' most significant legislative
successes of the 1990s, was signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's measure establishes block grants to states for federal
housing assistance, requires public housing tenants to perform
community service and integrates those communities with
economically mixed residents.
</P>
<P>
   But it also forces residents to meet higher income standards for
a subsidized home. Under Lazio's law, the majority of units _ 65
percent _ in a public housing complex are allotted to residents who
make up to 80 percent of an area's median income. Residents who
make up to 30 percent of the area's median income would qualify for
only 35 percent of the available apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the poorest families will have less space in
public housing than those who make more money. Lazio maintains this
provides an incentive for residents to find work. Hillary Clinton
charges that it could strip federal aid from the very people who
need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``believes that mixed-income housing is critically
important, and is in fact one of the reasons New York has amongst
the best public housing systems in the nation,'' according to a
statement released by her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, while some have supported draconian efforts to move
large numbers of low-income people out of public housing, Hillary
has supported a more balanced approach,'' the campaign said. ``As
we focus on addressing the homelessness problem, we shouldn't be
pushing more low-income families out of public housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, did not say how exactly she would change
Lazio's law.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also voted against capping rent for public housing tenants
based on their incomes. Clinton staunchly rejects the measure,
which would allow a tenant's rent to keep rising the more they
earn. Such a stand, critics have said, hints at the conservative
credentials Lazio adopted when the Republicans took over Congress
in 1994, despite his apparent moderate change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lazio voted for a ``Contract With America''
provision that would have severely limited Medicaid, part of an
overall rolling back of subsidized benefits in the push to overhaul
the welfare system. He eventually voted for the Welfare-to-Work
bill signed into law in 1996 by President Clinton after the White
House rejected two welfare reform bills approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, too, supports the Welfare-to-Work law, although
she has said it has not been wholly successful everywhere. ``The
fact is that with the welfare law the president signed, many
communities, though not all, are now moving people to permanent
work,'' she said recently. ``Clearly some places in the country are
doing it a lot better than other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lashed out at Lazio last month for what she said
was his refusal to expand a Federal Housing Authority insurance
program that would have made it easier for more first-time home
buyers to secure mortgages. Lazio did support expanding the FHA
program, but not to the extent House Democrats wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two agree on key areas, such as ensuring housing for
the elderly and veterans, providing transportation for
welfare-to-work participants to help them get to jobs, and severely
limiting food stamps if ``able-bodied'' recipients refuse to find
employment.
</P>
<P>
   And in at least one way, Lazio reached beyond the Clinton
administration to provide more benefits to welfare recipients: his
1998 public housing overhaul raised spending for veterans and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development by $400 million more
than what the Democratic White House initially requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says Republicans don't have an urban policy?'' Lazio said
after the measure passed.
