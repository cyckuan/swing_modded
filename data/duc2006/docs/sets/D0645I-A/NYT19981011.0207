EDITORIAL: A WIN-WIN ON HOUSING

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress, the new
majority has struggled with the Clinton administration over the
issue of low-income housing. Last week the two sides came together
and passed a measure that blends conservative and liberal concerns.
It is a major achievement for both the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long wanted to give low-income working people a
greater share of subsidized housing, while Democrats wanted to
favor the poorest of the poor, who have no resources to obtain
shelter at market rates.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had a point. Housing projects need to include stable
families with working adults who can serve as role models for other
residents. When homelessness exploded in the 1980s, too many
apartments in some projects were turned over to extremely indigent
families, tipping the community balance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' proposed solutions went too far. One
particularly bad idea was to change the income mix eligible for
rent-subsidy vouchers, a program that does not suffer from the same
problems as traditional housing projects. Unlike public housing
residents, who live in a closed community, people who receive the
vouchers are dispersed throughout the private housing market.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of housing advocates, the final bill creates
90,000 much-needed new vouchers and requires that 75 percent go to
the poorest of the poor. The bill relaxes some of the income limits
for housing projects to make room for more of the working poor,
although many units must still be reserved for the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 40 percent of project residents would have to
have incomes at or below $15,000, but other residents would be able
to make up to $40,150.
</P>
<P>
   Other compromises were equally sensible. The Republicans got
concessions aimed at rewarding effort, including very modest
community service requirements. Democrats got additional controls
to make sure that allowing more high-income families does not lead
to racial or economic segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill bows to the animal lobby's demand that all public
housing residents be allowed to keep animals, but officials in
cities like New York, where vicious dogs have long terrorized
residents of some large projects, will now apparently be able to
impose reasonable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, N.Y., the Republican point man on housing issues, have
represented two poles in this long struggle. This bill is a win for
both men. Cuomo and his predecessor Henry Cisneros have given what
was known as the federal government's worst-run bureaucracy some
credibility with Congress. Lazio has finally won his long battle to
make public housing a bipartisan issue.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans will always have an ideological objection
to federal housing subsidies, Lazio has always argued that many
others can be brought around, once they are convinced that the
system is well run and aimed at encouraging self-sufficiency. We
believe he is right, and this bill may be a big step in that
direction.
