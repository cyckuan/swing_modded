   WASHINGTON _ A study of American cities by the Clinton
administration says the strong national economy has left most of
them in their best financial shape in decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, ``The State of the Cities 1998,'' also finds
that the nation's urban centers are still suffering from chronic
problems afflicting the poor _ unemployment, inadequate housing and
substandard education _ that could grow worse over the next five
years as hundreds of thousands of city residents move off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   To help the welfare recipients as well as the low-income wage
earners they will be competing with for employment, the
administration has asked Congress to approve an array of new and
expanded programs as part of the 1999 fiscal year budget for what
the White House calls ``the most wide-ranging budget for cities in
more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of the request comes from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which is seeking $1.8 billion in new
spending beyond the appropriation of $24 billion it has received in
each of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the Clinton economy has meant real progress for
America's cities,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and
urban development. ``The president's urban agenda is helping cities
to continue to recover from years of decline and making them better
places to live and work. This is a mid-term report card with an A
grade for cities, but there is still homework to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100
billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get
additional money for new programs. Among other reasons, Republicans
in both houses are eager to use some of the surplus to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional aide familiar with the housing budget
negotiations that are now under way predicted that Congress would
likely authorize new spending for core programs, like additional
vouchers to allow inner-city residents to live closer to jobs or
transportation lines. But money for new ``bells and whistles''
programs, he added, will be harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is to be presented by Cuomo this weekend at
the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual convention in Reno, Nev.,
provides ample evidence that the country's economic growth in
recent years has dramatically improved conditions in cities of all
size around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major findings are a 10.4 percent increase in
employment in cities over the last five years, and a 34 percent
increase in new low-skilled jobs from 1994 to 1995, compared with a
13 percent increase from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains pale beside job growth in suburban areas, the
report says, a disparity that triggers a domino effect of adverse
consequences for cities. As urban problems like crime and poor
schools steadily persuade many middle-class residents to leave for
the suburbs, commercial investment follows, draining cities of
their job base and tax base.
</P>
<P>
   The report contends that the people who are hurt most are the
lowest-wage earners, who have fewer job opportunities and, often,
no practical means of transportation to reach jobs in the suburbs.
The report contends that over the next five years, their ranks will
increase by 353,000 as current welfare recipients join the search
for work.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent study of 74 urban areas by the conference of
mayors, the administration's report says that employers are likely
to find at least two applicants for the same low-paying job over
the next five years, and some cities, like Cleveland; Newark, N.J.,
and Providence, R.I., are projecting 10 or more more.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people
with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would
stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational
programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city
residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is not working at the low end,'' said William
Apgar, a senior housing department official who wrote the report.
''For those people, we need to have an extra push. The good news is
that cities are clearly doing better, but the hard-core issues are
not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the most ambitious of the programs proposed by
the Administration and their projected costs:
</P>
<P>
   _ The housing department is seeking $400 million for a new
Community Empowerment Fund, which would be used to leverage $2
billion in private-sector loans to create 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The department is also requesting $283 milion in new
low-income housing vouchers to make it easier for 50,000 welfare
recipients to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Department of Education wants $1.5 billion over five years
to create Education Opportunity Zones in high poverty areas and
$7.3 billion over the same period to hire new teachers to reduce
the class size in grades 1 through 3.
