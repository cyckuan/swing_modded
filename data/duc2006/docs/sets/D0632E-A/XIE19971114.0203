ULAN BATOR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
continue supporting the economic and political reforms in
Mongolia, a U.S. senior official said here.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Susan Shirk, who was on a visit to Mongolia
between November 12-14, made the remarks while meeting with
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Prime Minister
Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan.

She said that the United States was satisfied with the
development of relations and cooperation with Mongolia during the
past ten years after the two countries set up diplomatic ties.

<P>
The U.S. is also willing to cooperate with Mongolia in the
field of environmental protection, Susan added. She also revealed
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would probably visit
the Asian country.

Enkhsaikhan was grateful to the U.S. support for his country's
reforms and considered Susan's visit as a good beginning for the
U.S. delegation afterward.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. government attached
great importance to the strategic status of Mongolia, which led to
rapid development of the relations between the two countries.

<P>
So far, Mongolia has received more than 70 million U.S. dollars
of economic and technological aid from the United States, and the
two sides had signed an agreement on military exchange and
cooperation.
