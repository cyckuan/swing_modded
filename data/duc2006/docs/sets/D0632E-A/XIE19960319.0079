ULAN BATOR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will provide free technical aid worth 400,000 U.S. dollars
to Mongolia to help improve the living conditions of the country's
poor.

An ADB representative, after signing the agreement here with
Mongolian officials, told reporters poverty is one of the issues
obstructing economic restructuring in Mongolia and the bank hopes
the assistance will help solve the problem.

Montsame News Agency today said the assistance will go to the
Mongolian Women's Foundation for Helping the Poor.

A poverty alleviation program set up by the Mongolian
