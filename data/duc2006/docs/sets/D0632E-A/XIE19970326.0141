<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first French cabinet
minister visiting Mongolia has brought in a grant of 20 million
French franc (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Corinne Lepage, France's minister of environment, told a press
conference today that the assistance is earmarked for hydro-power
and environmental protection projects in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the official aid program, Lepage said at the end
of her two-day stay, she had signed a protocol with Shukhar
Altangerel, Mongolia's minister of external relations.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed with her Mongolian counterpart Tsohio
Adyasuren on cooperation in environmental protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, Lepage met with Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan,
and attended the opening ceremony of a French cultural center at
the Mongolian Foreign Languages Institute.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan reportedly told Lepage that while Mongolia has rich
natural resources and France owns advanced technologies, the two
could work together to complement each other's advantages.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope to further the bilateral cooperation in
culture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries has had diplomatic ties since 1965,
it was during President Ochirbat's tour of France last April that
they agreed on the reopening of French embassy here and their
relations took an upturn.
