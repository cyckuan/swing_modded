<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will give priority to
developing its relations with China and Russia, President Nachagyn
Bagabandy said today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that developing relations with China and Russia has
been and will always be the primary principle of Mongolia's
foreign policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president praised China for its fast economic development,
and said China's role and reputation on the world stage have
increased day by day.
</P>
<P>
He said China has become an important force in maintaining
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, and
Mongolia will "further develop its cooperative relationship with
China, which is beneficial to both sides."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy, who was sworn in as Mongolia's new president Sunday,
said that in recent years Mongolia has expanded its cooperation
with China, and the two countries have enhanced mutual
understanding and trust between them.
</P>
<P>
He added that the legal basis for developing the relationship
between the two nations has been further consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The official visit to Mongolia in April by Qiao Shi, chairman
of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, is
an important step toward a closer relationship and cooperation
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is willing to promote the good-neighborly ties of
cooperation with China in the spirits of equality and mutual
benefits and in accordance with international norms and a
friendship agreement signed in 1994, said the president.
</P>
<P>
"Mongolia pursues an open foreign policy of non-alignment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In developing foreign relations, he said, it is highly
important for Mongolia to create a sound outside environment,
overcome difficulties arising from the transformation of economic
structures, and to promote national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, Bagabandy said he will give priority to
curbing inflation and stabilizing currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the prices and currency exchange rates are kept
stable, can the country ensure that more investments will flow in,
people's income will rise and people will enhance their confidence
in the future."
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy vowed to give particular attention to fighting
unemployment and poverty, which have become the most serious
problems of the country.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that by June, 64,200 Mongolians had
lost their jobs, but the actual number of unemployment had reached
200,000.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce poverty and unemployment, Mongolia has to
take macro-control measures to stabilize economic situation,
increase investment, revitalize national industry, agriculture and
animal husbandry, and fully support private productive activities,
commerce and trade, he noted.
