U.S. ACTS TO TIGHTEN PROTECTION OF WETLANDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday proposed new
rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from
development, a response to what administration officials called a
recent rash of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the last two years, some 20,000 acres
of wetlands and an additional 150 miles of streams had been
destroyed because of what they portrayed as a loophole opened by a
court decision three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, to take effect after a 60-day period of public
comment, would close that loophole by adding greater detail to
regulations that specify what kinds of wetlands development require
an environmental impact review by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to
fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal
district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the
District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, both
courts held that developers did not need to obtain a federal permit
to excavate, drain or ditch a wetland as long as they did not dump
soil on the property in question. The EPA had sought as early 1993
to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental
review, but that approach was rejected by the courts, which ruled
in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners in that case was the National Association of
Homebuilders, which Thursday expressed strong disagreement with the
new rules. ``This is a bad decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Susan
Asmus, ``and it is not consistent with the previous court rulings
or with the Clean Water Act.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own announcement, Carol Browner, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said: ``Today's proposal will
allow us to go as far as we can through administrative reforms to
close this loophole and protect wetlands. The action we take today
strengthens the protection of vital resources for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly the Sierra Club hailed the decision as an important
strengthening of environmental safeguards. ``Limiting this loophole
should protect the streams and wetlands that are home to thousands
of birds, fish and other wildlife,'' said Robin Mann of the club's
National Wetlands Committee. ``Streams and marshes protect our
communities by acting as a natural sponge, soaking up water that
would otherwise flood our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials warned that the action would not in
itself be sufficient to guard against destruction of wetlands, and
called on Congress to strengthen the Clean Water Act further.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes,
swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land
and bodies of water. These areas play important roles in filtering
and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and
in harboring fish and shellfish populations.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's announcement Thursday vividly described the areas'
significance. ``Destruction of wetlands,'' the statement said,
``can increase flooding and runoff potential, harm neighboring
property, cause stream and river pollution and result in the loss
of valuable habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1700s, the agency said, over half the nation's
wetlands have been lost to development and other activities. Seven
states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original
wetlands.
