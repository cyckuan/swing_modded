<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Wetlands Protections  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of deliberations, the Clinton
administration next week will impose tougher requirements on
developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands,
according to sources familiar with the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilders said Friday the new rules are unneeded and will
stall economic development, but environmentalists welcomed the
tighter restrictions, saying construction under old rules led to
the loss of thousands of acres of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for
Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated
internally for more than four years and were spurred by an
environmental group's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements will take effect in June, according to the
Army Corps' final draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 172-page regulatory overall will require developers to seek
special, individual permits to build if they want to fill in a
wetland of one-half acre or more. Prior to a lawsuit by the Natural
Resources Defense Council in 1996, the cutoff was 10 acres, a
standard the Army Corps later reduced to three acres.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also will end developers' use of a
streamlined ''nationwide permit'' process for most construction,
meaning that specific permits will have to be approved for each
project.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilders have complained that this new process will delay
construction and require unnecessarily stringent review. They argue
that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form
new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mitchell, a Maryland builder who is president of the
National Association of Home Builders, predicted ''a dramatic
negative effect on the homebuilding industry'' because of delays
and more stringent wetlands protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by a group of landowners and developers and
the National Association of Counties estimated the cost to the
economy of the new permitting process at $300 million a year.
However, the Army Corps has estimated the additional cost at closer
to $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of
having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of
disappearing wetland acres.
</P>
<P>
   Although specific numbers are in dispute, environmentalists say
the country, nevertheless, is losing as much as 100,000 acres of
wetlands annually. They maintain a fifth of those losses have been
due to the Army Corps building permit policies.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called
nationwide Permit 26, which applies to development, including home
construction and road building, and replace it with individual
permits as the Army Corps now is going to do.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the nationwide permitting system amounted to giving
''rubber-stamp'' approval to construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been the single largest source of permitted wetlands
destruction in the country,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Association of Home Builders argues that
wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands
than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the group argues, the nationwide permitting
system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects
without environmental damage. The average time to get an individual
permit approved was more than a year, compared with about a month
for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects,
the group estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The new reliance on individual permits, with a one-half-acre
wetlands threshold, ''means more regulations, delays and costs,
less flexibility'' for developers, said Mitchell.
