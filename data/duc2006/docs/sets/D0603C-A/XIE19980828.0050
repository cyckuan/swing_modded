<P>
China will no longer consider the interests of tree-cutters
when building hydroelectric power station on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze and will not leave log channels for them.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all
water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry
development along China's major rivers must be assessed in
accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no
projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Ecological damage has been a source of this year's
floods. Water levels on some sections of the Yangtze and at
Dongting Lake have reached record highs, even though the flow was
below record levels.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration said in a
report that serious damage to lakes, pools, and wetlands, a
decline in vegetation's ecological function, and the resulting
soil erosion have all contributed to the floods.
</P>
<P>
The administration is doing a more detailed study of ecological
problems along China's major rivers and is trying to suggest ways
of easing the problem.
