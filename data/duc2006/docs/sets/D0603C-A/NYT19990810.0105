<P>
   Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of
the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly
retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams,
swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the
Corps' records indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with
protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible
violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2
percent of permit applications for major wetland projects. In 1992,
the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according
to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters
goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they
feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one
field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid
time-consuming, costly enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps
offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7
million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55. During
that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as
the region's economy prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and
enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects
a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so
there are fewer attempts to damage them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget
freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to
1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor
issues and allowing state regulators to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've substantially increased environmental
protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the
headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.

   But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to
enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has
become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said
Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility,
who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve
developments she felt should have been turned down. ``A program
without enforcement is an invitation to break the law without
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group
for government employees concerned about environmental issues,
provided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other
documents obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the
Freedom of Information Act after employees complained of a
precipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife
Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom
for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do
not have strong enforcement programs. He said New England states
generally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough
Corps can help stand up to powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't
organize it the way it is. But given where we are, we would be in
real bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie
said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government
tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are
nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. Americans
destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that
these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing
floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap
water.

   Clinton steps in
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of
wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating
100,000 acres more than are destroyed. The main tool would be the
restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the
Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two
agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of
Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together
share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that
governs wetland development.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland
enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in
Boston. At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million
more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by
Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the
Corps is often an obstacle to development.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton
does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly. Almost half of
the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses
and individuals to challenge Corps decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less
comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA. The Corps, best
known as the builder of public works and flood control projects,
objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in
1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because
of a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also
cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility review. Orders to
restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109
since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to
5,141 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps
employee said. ``What's the use of getting a permit if people can
do it without a permit?''
</P>
<P>
   A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the
whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases
to avoid. According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do
nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a
reported violation is substantial. Even with some major violations,
the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case''
if another agency will not take over.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Work overload
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the
office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun
transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is
overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by
one full-time and one part-time staff member.
</P>
<P>
   But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes
sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger
legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle
prosecution of flagrant cases.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement
overlooks big improvements at the Corps. For instance, he said the
Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland
damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit,
three times smaller than the previous minimum size.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement
that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is
more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005. Our part of
that is that we believe we should continue to administer the
program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands
created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows
half of them fail. Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage
Studet cites does not include illegal activity.

   Criticism of Corps
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility
said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of
controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries. Even in
the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is
more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one
Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the
rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has
lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for
the crop. The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly
granted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to
offset the damage.
</P>
<P>
   New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each
project received proper review before it was approved, saying
critics ``are rushing to judgment. We certainly were knowledgeable
that the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean
we are going to roll over. We are very careful not to give special
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up
wetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate
12 positions during the last four years. ``We're doing more with
less,'' he said.
