<HEADLINE> Burlington County GOP leader seeks cranberry bog permit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Burlington County Republican leader who
used 22 acres of protected wetland in the Pinelands to expand
harvesting operations may soon be off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield DeMarco, former Burlington County GOP chairman and a
generous contributor to state Republican causes, has applied for a
newly created state permit that would give the expansion
after-the-fact state approval.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the
acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before
undertaking the expansion. The state Department of Environmental
Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him
of the violation.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as
$10,000 per day. At that rate, the potential penalty now exceeds $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, said DEP officials have
given no indication that they plan to impose anywhere near the
maximum potential penalty against the cranberry grower.
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Peter Page said the department is negotiating with
DeMarco over how much to assess in penalties, but he said DeMarco
could have been eligible for a state permit had he sought one.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with DeMarco's possible settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say DeMarco is a well-connected political figure in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   DEP Commissioner Robert C. Shinn is a Burlington County native
and a political protege of DeMarco's. Page said Shinn has excused
himself from the case, citing appearance of a potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Paulsen, chairman of the Burlington County GOP, is manager
of the Trenton office of Capehart &AMP; Scatchard, the law firm
representing DeMarco's application.
</P>
<P>
   State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms
involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than
$200,000 last year. Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey
Republicans $517,000 - including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I think this is special-interest money and
special-interest regulatory privilege,'' Bill Neil, director of the
conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions. ''This is a sorry
chapter in New Jersey policy history.''
</P>
<P>
   Drollas said DeMarco's political ties have nothing to do with
the application.
</P>
<P>
   Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in
the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective
maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed
to be off limits to development because of their value as a
wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
</P>
<P>
   Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10
acres in any year. That means DeMarco's 22-acre expansion will have
to be phased in under permits issued over the next three years.
