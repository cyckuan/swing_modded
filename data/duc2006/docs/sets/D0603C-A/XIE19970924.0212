<HEADLINE> Yunnan Effectively Protects Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Local sources report that
effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands,
Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of
flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge
sewage and conserve water, according to experts. Wetlands are thus
ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild
plants and waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is
divided into two major sections -- Beihai Marshland and Qinghai
Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and
bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory
birds.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992,
and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued
wide-ranging regulations to protect the area.
</P>
<P>
Planned afforestation has been carried out in the reserve and
surrounding areas in recent years, with strict regulations in
place to prohibit poaching. The local governments at all levels
have also extended great efforts to teach people to cherish the
natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.
