THREATENED FROG TO GET EXTRA PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is
believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get
extra protection from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to an order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San
Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in
31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the
frog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in
California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia
Foulk.
</P>
<P>
   The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the
largest native frog in the West. It breeds in wetlands, streams,
ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70
percent. Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult
red-legged frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where
some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are
designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal
permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their
projects. The Fish and Wildlife Service has to sign off on those
permits, attesting that the development will not have an adverse
effect on the threatened species, as defined by the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity
in Berkeley, said that a major pressure point where development and
the red-legged frog may collide is in Contra Costa County where
several big subdivisions along Danville and Tassajara creeks are in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that
designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered
species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it. The
agency can fine developers who knowingly trash a critical habitat,
but as a practical matter, she said, mitigation measures such as
altering the footprint of a development, or the land on which a
building will be constructed, usually satisfy the agency's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is less of a protective measure than
environmentalists would like, ``it's a positive step and might
bring about the recovery of a listed species,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The red-legged frog was listed as threatened in 1996 under the
Endangered Species Act. At that time, the Fish and Wildlife Service
concluded that designating a critical habitat was ``not prudent,''
because it would not benefit the species and might make it more
vulnerable to habitat vandalism and unauthorized collection. Alsup
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Center for Biological Diversity as a plaintiff in
the complaint against the Fish and Wildlife Service were the
Jumping Frog Research Institute of Calaveras County and the Center
for Sierra Nevada Conservation.
