BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Conserving China's wetlands is a
national priority, said Zhen Rende, director of the wildlife and
forestry department of the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Headed by the ministry, 17 ministries and commissions are
formulating the systematic action program to guide the country's
conservation and use of wetlands, Zhen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the International Workshop on Wetlands which opened
today in this sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, he
announced that the program includes the establishment of wetlands
nature reserves, protection of species, spreading of scientific
findings and training of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the
earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other
shallow water land.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood
prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of
organisms.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was
established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971.
</P>
<P>
To collect the comprehensive information on China's wetlands
resources, China has organized several large-scale investigations
in the past few years and ran several training classes in Jiangxi,
Shandong provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions for the
administration of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China has more than 63
million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9 percent of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the
wetlands were useless mud. Now more and more people have
recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and
the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent
task.
</P>
<P>
The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by
China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and
Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands
 and water birds in Beidaihe.
