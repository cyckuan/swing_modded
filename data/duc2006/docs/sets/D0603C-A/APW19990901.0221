	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- A temporary dirt logging road carved across a  
half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest 
ski area, in trouble with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Tom Allender, resort planning director, and his crews  
built the road to access an 885-acre expansion into undeveloped 
backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had  
done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in 
the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation  
last month. The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to 
$27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the 
Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through 
wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake. But the EPA's  
Steve Ireland rejected that defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United  
States without a permit, it is a violation,'' he said. ``It's worse 
if they knew they were breaking the law, but whether it was 
unintentional doesn't change anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road,  
leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut 
timber and no way to remove it. It may have to be burned on site. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so  
logging trucks could remove the timber without rumbling through the 
tourist-clogged village. Allender said he became confused when 
building it because surveyors had left three proposed routes marked 
with ribbons through the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial  
effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the  
project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't 
adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx. 
Last fall, a group calling itself Earth Liberation Front claimed 
responsibility for an outbreak of fires at the resort that caused 
$12 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix  
the damage to the wetlands.
