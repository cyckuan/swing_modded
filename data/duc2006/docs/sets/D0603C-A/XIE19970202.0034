<HEADLINE> Uganda Promotes Wetlands Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has made progress in
protecting its wetlands since an international convention on
wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The convention, an inter-governmental treaty launched at
Ramsar, Iran, on February 2, 1971, partly aims to the
conservation of wetlands as habitats for migratory water birds
and enhance international cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
The day, adopted by a conference on wetlands held in Brisbane,
Austria in March 1996 as World Wetlands Day, was marked with a
theme "Wetlands and Community" in Masaka District, 120 kilometers
southwest of capital Kampala today.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to
raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need
of conservation.
</P>
<P>
The country has also developed a national wetlands policy,
including the designation of Lake George's wetland, southwestern
Uganda as a convention site, the research and evaluation of
wetlands for facilitating their wise use.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, in February, 1996, set up a hot line for the
public to report environment abuse and announced that new
draining of swamps for economic development is no longer allowed
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Netherlands offered Uganda funds for restoring
some swamps in the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's wetlands cover an area of about 29,600 square
kilometers and make for 12 percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains
into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda's wetlands has decreased in acreage, mainly
due to human activities including grazing, brick-making, reduced
vegetation, rice planting and hunting especially of antelopes and
water birds.
</P>
<P>
Large tracts of wetlands in the country currently have been
drained into paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala and Kabale District bordering on Rwanda, many
swampy areas have been drained for farming and house
construction. enditem
