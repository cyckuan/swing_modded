EDITORIAL: PROTECTION FOR THE WETLANDS

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have
promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the
100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help
prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for
endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food
chain. They have succeeded in beating back the big threats,
including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later,
the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these
valuable acres to private interests almost overnight. But they have
been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers,
which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on
developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter
regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep
chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites. The rules would
require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all
projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the
current minimum of three acres. This change could make a big
difference. Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are
disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year,
many of them lost to development on small parcels. Regionally, the
rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of
acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are
threatened by small-scale development.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton
administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that took the Corps to court. The rules also
represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an
arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit
26. Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative
efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic
permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres
of wetlands. In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three
acres. But even these stricter standards have allowed the
disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several important steps remain. Developers and contractors have
denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to
resist legislative attempts to overturn them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce
the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way. This will
require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development
proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules. The
administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs
for these additional enforcement responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to
cheer. The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental
stewardship, has acted responsibly.
