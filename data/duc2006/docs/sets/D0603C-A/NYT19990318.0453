NYC DROPS PUSH TO RESTRICT LAND NEAR RESERVOIRS 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ After repeated efforts to persuade the federal
government to strictly limit building on marshes around New York
City's upstate reservoirs, the Giuliani administration reversed
itself this week, saying the wetlands needed no special
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials
from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city
officials against private environmental groups and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special
restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's
water.
</P>
<P>
   The change was outlined in a March 15 letter from Environmental
Protection Commissioner Joel Miele to the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which is updating federal rules for wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups and Democratic city officials assailed
the move and accused Giuliani of putting his possible race for the
Senate, and his need for Republican support outside the city, ahead
of his responsibility to protect the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, denied there was
any political motive behind the change. One of Miele's deputies
made the original recommendations, and Miele never approved them,
Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota defended the city's new stance, saying the city's water
supply was already sufficiently protected from pollution. ``Anyone
who makes the argument that these new rules would protect the
watershed any further, that's just false and cheap politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The city reversed its stance on the new restrictions after the
original recommendations angered Republican state legislators and
county officials, who called Giuliani and Miele to complain that
tighter rules would stifle development.

<P>
   Without a strong recommendation by the city for special rules
around the reservoirs, several environmental lawyers said, the
stricter standard are less likely to be adopted by the Army Corps
of Engineers, particularly because upstate communities have sent
the agency extensive comments of their own, opposing such a move.
The agency is responsible for issuing permits for filling in small
tracts of wetlands and thus can limit development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme and radical action to withdraw recommendations
like this,'' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for Riverkeeper,
an environmental group that strongly supported the Giuliani
administration two years ago when it committed to an ambitious plan
to protect the water supply. ``We're worried that water quality is
being traded for political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide
system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify
areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and
need protection.
</P>
<P>
   The city's original written comments, by Dr. William Stasiuk, a
deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental
Protection in charge of the water supply, recommended that the
strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the
2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual
applications required for any filling or construction affecting
more than one-third of an acre of wetlands. The general standard
used by the Federal agency requires an application and review only
for any project filling more than three acres of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Stasiuk said extra protection was needed because ``further loss
or degradation of the remaining wetlands in the watersheds may
jeopardize regional water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   But when his comments were circulated in upstate communities
last month, local officials called them a ``sneak attack'' on the
rights of residents around the reservoirs to develop their
property. Stasiuk declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several city officials sent Giuliani letters
criticizing the retraction of Stasiuk's original wetlands
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, they said the city's reversal increased the
chances that the water supply would slowly be degraded, eventually
forcing the city to build a $6 billion filtration plant to remove
pollution that could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by
the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the
reservoirs deserve special protection.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Miele defended the change in the
city's position, saying there was no need to saddle communities in
the watershed with extra federal restrictions because his staff
already had the right to stop any action that might pollute the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Miele acknowledged that the city's options were
somewhat limited. Two years ago, it signed an agreement with
communities around the reservoirs that ended their longstanding
legal challenges to the city's pollution regulations around the
watersheds. In return, the city began spending hundreds of millions
of dollars to help the communities keep the water clean, and it
acknowledged their right to continue to grow economically.
