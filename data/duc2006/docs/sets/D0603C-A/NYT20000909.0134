DEVELOPERS FACE TOUGHER BUILDING RESTRICTIONS ON NEW YORK CITY
WETLANDS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Thursday tougher
restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of
an acre, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess
counties, said Joseph Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for
any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a
region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a
Hudson River environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are critical little pieces,'' he said. ``There are lots
of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control.
They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's
near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking
water system.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have
been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around
the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal
regulations, adopted last spring _ and tougher than previous ones _
will continue to apply.
