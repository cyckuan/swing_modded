GROUPS SAY CRANBERRY GROWERS MISLEAD ON ACREAGE

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Cranberry farmers have been quietly expanding
into more and more unregulated acreage, even as they have sought
federal approval to use sensitive wetlands, environmental groups
assert.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation came as one of the state's largest growers, A.R.
DeMarco Enterprises, was charged this month with illegally
expanding into 22 acres of regulated wetlands in Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
   That charge by the state Department of Environmental Protection
_ which could mean heavy fines for the owner, Garfield DeMarco, a
former Burlington County Republican leader _ cast further suspicion
on the industry in the eyes of some environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The $25-million-a-year cranberry industry has thrived for over
200 years in the state's pinelands on the fringes of natural
wetlands, where swampy conditions and a web of streams, dams and
ditches allow farmers to flood growing areas easily and cheaply
with the water that is essential to the crop.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New Jersey, the most urban and densely populated
state in the country, has become the third-largest cranberry
producer, behind Massachusetts and Wisconsin. And many people see
the farming of cranberries, as well as blueberries, both of which
depend on clean water, as compatible with, and indeed an aid to,
wetlands preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The growers say they need to expand into regulated wetlands to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But William Neil, director of conservation for the New Jersey
Audubon Society, asserts that cranberry growers have already been
working far more than the 3,500 acres that they have cited in their
expansion applications.
</P>
<P>
   He said that reports on pesticide use suggested that as much as
4,481 acres of cranberries were being grown in the state, and that
other statistics from the state Department of Agriculture put the
figure at put the figure at 3,900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lee, one of the state's 48 cranberry growers and a
spokesman for the group, denied any deception. He said that he and
other growers had always indicated that they were modestly
expanding into unregulated, upland areas and into blueberry bogs on
their land. Those expansions had added as much as 400 acres to the
state's cranberry inventory in recent years, he conceded, which
would put the total at about 3,900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have done it on our farm to the maximum extent possible
without touching regulated wetlands,'' Lee said. ``This is true of
most of the other farmers. We are all tapped out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the growers, most of whom are part of the large Ocean
Spray cooperative, had not hidden expansions from the public, as
Neil asserted. He said they had always told regulators that they
were converting blueberry bogs to more lucrative cranberry
production wherever possible, and extending growing areas upland,
away from the wetlands, when it did not require extensive
redirection of water.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations by Neil came about three weeks after the state
and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that they were
close to approving conditions under which growers could expand into
300 acres of wetlands over the next five years without seeking
specific permission for each expansion as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The draft agreement on what is called the ``general permit''
could be approved later this month. But it is being opposed by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as ``the most environmentally
damaging proposal'' considered by regulators over the last five
years. Echoing this sentiment, environmental groups like the
Audubon Society have asked federal environmental regulators to
reconsider their support.
