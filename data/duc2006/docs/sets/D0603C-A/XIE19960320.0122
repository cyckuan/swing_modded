<HEADLINE> New International Wetlands Protection Body Formed </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a new
International conservation body announced today was vital to the
wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told
at the Ramsar meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands International was launched at the Ramsar
Convention conference held in Brisbane, a port city in
Northeastern Australia, with the participation of some 1000
delegates from about 120 countries, The Australian Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands
for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands
Research Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing
the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership
between government and non-government interests to work for the
goal of wetlands conservation.
</P>
<P>
Hill told the conference that relations between Wetlands
International and Australia have been strengthened to the point
that a formal agreement would be signed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Asian delegates to the international Ramsar conference called
on the governing bureau to cut costs and move its headquarters out
of Switzerland to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Swami Singh Boparai, the Asian regional representative, said
that as the infrastructure is available less costly in the
developing world, the bureau secretariat can consider moving to a
developing country so that it can have within the same budget more
manpower and more activity.
</P>
<P>
Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries
were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and
fauna. Malaysia has estimated that its wetlands contributed 10
percent of its GDP although this percentage may have declined
slightly as industrialization increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more
than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the
administrative bureau based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Previous Ramsar conferences have been held in Italy, France,
the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland and Japan. The vital
importance of wetlands to Asia has led India to bid to host the
next Ramsar meeting in New Delhi in 1999.
