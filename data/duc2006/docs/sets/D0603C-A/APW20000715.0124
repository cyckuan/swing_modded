<HEADLINE> Wetlands, Sewer Projects Aid River  </HEADLINE>

   IMPERIAL, Calif. (AP) -- It is known as one of the nation's
dirtiest waterways, an 80-mile drain that catches raw sewage and
industrial waste from the Mexican border city of Mexicali and mixes
it with agricultural runoff from the irrigated fields of the
Imperial Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of hand-wringing and bad publicity, the New
River is getting the kind of attention that could end its
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   A federally financed project to create artificial wetlands that
would cleanse millions of gallons of river water is nearing
completion, and the U.S. and Mexican governments last month
announced $50 million in financing for badly needed upgrades to the
Mexicali sewage treatment system.
</P>
<P>
   The combination could go a long way to removing much of the
pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the
Salton Sea, the largest lake in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually, with what we're doing and what they're doing we'll
clean up a lot of the problems with this river,'' said Leon
Lesicka, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and chairman of a task
force coordinating river cleanup projects.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of significant improvement in the river could be less than
four years away, said Eugenia McNaughton, an environmental
scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a workable problem and we are working on it,''
McNaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the progress is visible only along the river's banks at
two sites near Imperial and Brawley, about 100 miles east of San
Diego, where workers are carving berms and ponds for the artificial
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will
plant bull rushes and other wetland plants. They won't use New
River water out of concern for the workers' health, Lesicka said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the
border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the
surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes
and throat after a few minutes of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants float down the river to avoid the Border
Patrol, knowing agents are reluctant to follow them in. Polio,
tetanus and tuberculosis have all been found in the river,
according to the Imperial Irrigation District, the valley's main
water agency.
</P>
<P>
   The river was formed from Colorado River flooding between 1904
and 1906. Waters breached a canal and turned a usually dry creek
bed into a river that flows from about 20 miles south of Mexicali
to the Salton Sea, a lake with no natural outlets that is choking
on its high salinity.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved $3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to
filter the contaminated water through a process known as
bioremediation. An additional $25 million of federal funding
through the North American Development Bank is the U.S.
contribution to the sewer upgrade in Mexicali, a city that has
grown to an estimated 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Irrigation District, which also is part of the task
force and is building part of the wetlands, will consider adding
more wetlands sites to help filter the water, possibly expanding to
the nearby Alamo River, another Salton Sea tributary, said agency
spokeswoman Sue Giller.
</P>
<P>
   In the artificial wetlands being built, water will flow into
collection ponds, where silt and minerals will settle to the
bottom, then pass through a series of reed-covered berms before
returning to the river again. Biologists will monitor the
collection ponds over three years to see how they affect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy way to explain why the cleanup has taken so
long, said Marie Barrett, a biologist involved with the project and
a lifelong valley resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we realized we had a problem, it took us a long time to
get going,'' she said. ''But now we're actually doing something and
it's so exciting.''
