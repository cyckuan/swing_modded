<HEADLINE> Russia' Putin Off to Powerful Start  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- A string of victories in parliament have
solidified President Vladimir Putin's authority and appear to be
setting the stage for a calmer, more conciliatory era in Russia
after the frenzied confusion of the Boris Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office as acting president in December, Putin has
persuaded once-combative lawmakers to do two things they
steadfastly refused to do under Yeltsin: approve the START II
nuclear disarmament treaty and fire Russia's top prosecutor.
Lawmakers also approved the nuclear test ban treaty on Friday at
Putin's urging.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks invincible. The president's powers are already great,
and now it seems the legislative branch is ready to support him --
or afraid to oppose him,'' said Alexei Chaplygin, an analyst with
the Center for Civil Society Studies, a Moscow think tank. ''It's
very popular to like Putin now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin could just be enjoying a honeymoon after
his election by a wide margin last month. He could face more
bruising debate, for example, when he finally presents his plan for
the crucial and touchy issue of restoring Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, observers predict Putin will probably have little
trouble getting what he wants -- whatever that turns out to be.
While he talks of stamping out corruption, reviving Russia's global
clout and trimming taxes, he is vague about how he would realize
those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has a key advantage that his predecessor lacked: majority
support in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma. The
Communists and their allies who dominated the Duma for years lost
their majority in December parliamentary elections, and were
replaced by centrists who generally back Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Putin has done so far is clean up after Yeltsin. It
was Yeltsin who signed START II in 1993 then fought with the Duma
for years over ratification, and Yeltsin who first tried to fire
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were all Yeltsin's issues. Does that mean Putin will
continue Yeltsin's policies? Who knows,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk,
deputy director of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   One policy Putin appears determined to pursue is nuclear
disarmament. As soon as the Duma ratified START II, talks began in
Geneva on further cuts of warhead stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin is treading cautiously. He insists Russia will pull
out of any arms control pact if Washington follows through on
amending the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to build a limited
anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia will ensure its security as it sees fit,'' said
chairman of the Duma's defense committee, Andrei Nikolayev. ''The
ratification of START II has created a unique situation for
maneuvering by the Russian president,'' both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism may prove the strongest common ground between Putin
and parliament. Legislators of all political stripes embrace
Putin's goal of restoring Russia's international influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a strengthening of cooperation could only have come about
because of nationalism. The Duma still has a very nationalist
majority. Putin will use that nationalism and that majority to
exercise pressure on (Russia's) international partners,'' Kremenyuk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is seen as a cool-headed consensus-builder, unlike the
temperamental, fervently anti-communist Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met almost no resistance with his request Wednesday that
the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, fire top
prosecutor Skuratov. The house generally supports the government,
but defiantly refused Yeltsin's repeated requests to fire Skuratov
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which is made up of regional governors, appears
eager to stay in Putin's favor. Analysts say the governors are
worried that Putin will slash regional leaders' powers if they
prove too unruly.
</P>
<P>
   Even Skuratov, who says Yeltsin's inner circle was trying to
remove him to thwart his investigation into alleged Kremlin
corruption, seemed unfazed by dismissal at the hand of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Skuratov warned that Putin may not tackle high-level
graft because of his close ties to Yeltsin's scandal-marred
administration. Putin has promised to fight corruption, which
plagues every facet of Russian life and is a key obstacle to
economic progress.
