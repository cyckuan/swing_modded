<HEADLINE> Putin Book Offers Glimpse Into Man  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin, a steely enigma
to most Russians, lets his guard down a little in a book of
interviews released Monday, less than two weeks before the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The book also includes interviews with his wife, two daughters
and friends, offering a personal side to a man who is all-business
in public. It even shows him in a candid photo moment, grimacing as
he gets a smooch from his poodle.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a 16-year veteran of the KGB and later head of its main
successor, the FSB, appears carefully controlled in public, but
says in the book that there were some impulsive currents in his
early life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't join the Pioneers, the Communist youth group
in which virtually all Soviet children were members, until the
sixth grade, he says: ''I was a hooligan, not a Pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   And he reveals that in college he had some serious love affairs,
including one that was leading to marriage -- until he got cold feet
after rings and wedding finery had been bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked like the last scoundrel, but I decided it would be
better to do that now than for her and me to suffer later,'' he
says in the book, entitled ''From the First Person -- Conversations
with Vladimir Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Vagrius, had planned to put 500,000 copies up for
sale, but pulled back after being told by election officials that
selling the book would violate Russia's election law and even lead
to Putin's dismissal from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Vagrius head Gleb Uspensky said Monday that the publishing house
decided to print just 50,000 copies and sell all them to Putin's
campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The book discloses nothing that is likely to undermine Putin's
huge lead in opinion polls ahead of the March 26 vote. He has
consistently recorded support of around 60 percent, compared with
about 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Communist Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   It also does much to reinforce the image of firmness that
apparently is Putin's strong suit with voters, especially his tough
stance on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he maintains the offensive against Chechnya was
necessary to save Russia -- and, possibly, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was confident that if we didn't stop the extremists, we
would face the threat of Russian turning into another Yugoslavia,''
Putin says. ''Disintegration of such a vast country would trigger a
global catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rise from little-known bureaucrat to acting president
coincided with the Chechnya war. He was appointed prime minister by
President Boris Yeltsin in August, shortly Chechen rebels attacked
the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who took over the presidency when Yeltsin abruptly
resigned Dec. 31, denied that he was riding the war into the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining a tough tone on Chechnya, Putin reiterated in
the book his recent statement that Russia may consider joining
NATO, albeit adding that the country's admission would be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they would fear the destruction of NATO,'' he said.
''We are too powerful a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, asked to name historical figures he admires, first said
Napoleon Bonaparte. Then he added former French President Charles
de Gaulle and German Chancellor Ludvig Erhard.
</P>
<P>
   The new personal revelations aside, many of Putin's positions
remain unclear, including detailed proposals on how to address
Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he promised to strengthen protection of foreign
investment in Russia, but warned that the country could not rely on
outside money alone to spur its sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov has repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to present
a detailed platform.
