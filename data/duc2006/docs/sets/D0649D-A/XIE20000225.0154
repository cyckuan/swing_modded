<HEADLINE> Putin Publishes Election Program in Open Letter to Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin said here Friday that Russia needed a tougher
struggle against crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Putin made the remarks in an open letter to the voters about
his program for the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"As we have been talking for years about fighting crime, that
evil was continuing to entrench itself everywhere. A whole
republic, a Russian region, Chechnya, was taken over by the
criminal world and turned into a terrorism fortress. But we
attacked the gangsters and defeated them. This was the first step
towards the preeminence of the law, to the dictatorship of a law
that treats everybody equally," he wrote in a letter which was
published in the Friday issue of Russian newspaper Izvestiya.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the terrorist and criminal is now hiding, he cannot
hope to find refuge in Chechnya. A terrible blow has been dealt at
the gangster world," Putin adds.
</P>
<P>
The letter consists of two parts: "Our Problems" and "Our
Priorities".
</P>
<P>
Russia's greatest problems are the loss of will power, the
state's loss of will to bring to completion what it has started,
hesitation and the habit to put off the most difficult activities,
Putin writes.
</P>
<P>
This results "in the ancient evil -- crime -- being driven deep
into Russia." "It has gone so far that a whole republic, namely
Chechnya, succumbed to the criminal world," Putin says.
</P>
<P>
He is sure that "it was necessary to meet the challenge on the
enemy's field and to rout him there."
</P>
<P>
Russia's second "big problem", Putin believes, "is lack of firm
and universally recognized rules."
</P>
<P>
"Order requires rules. And it is best for those who are now
busy juggling concepts, claiming that lack of order means genuine
democracy, to stop seeking dirty tricks and scaring us with the
past," it says.
</P>
<P>
The state must set firm and generally accepted rules to ensure
legality and democracy in all spheres including the economy, Putin
says.
</P>
<P>
"The state must begin with itself. It must set equal rules and
comply with them," he stressed. "Only an efficient and strong
state can afford to live by the rule of law, and individual is
freer in a stronger country," he says.
</P>
<P>
The third problem is that the state is insufficiently aware of
its resources, Putin notes.
</P>
<P>
Putin prioritized "the fight against our own poverty."
</P>
<P>
The debt to the elderly should be reimbursed. "It's not just a
social but a political and moral task," he says.
</P>
<P>
Putin admitted that money is needed to "do away with
humiliation by poverty," but "a further ballooning of our already
large social security budget is not the right method."
</P>
<P>
On Russia's foreign policy, Putin emphasizes that "the external
policy should be shaped in the national interests of our own
country."
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the priority of domestic goals over foreign goals
should be recognized, he writes.
