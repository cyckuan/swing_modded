<HEADLINE> Putin Pushes for 1st-Round Election  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- With his standing in the polls dipping, acting
President Vladimir Putin urged voters Saturday to elect him with a
clear majority to avoid a second round, but denied that he's
worried about winning.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign trip to the southern city of Voronezh, Putin was
cautious about the outcome of the March 26 election, saying he
would prefer a clear decision to avoid a runoff. But he said his
call was based solely on a desire to save the country the expense
of a second-round vote.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show support for Putin down by 2 to 3 percentage
points compared to the 60 percent he had received in recent weeks.
Putin's nearest rival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov,
trails with about 20 percent, while most of the other candidates
barely show up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I count on success, but it's not of major importance in which
round to win. It's the result that matters,'' Putin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Putin said the first round of voting will cost
about $5.3 million. If a second round is necessary two weeks later,
it will cost an additional $3.5 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nearly as much as all the pensions paid in the Moscow
region,'' Putin said in an interview with the Mayak radio station
aired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said if he wins, there will be no room in his
administration for the business moguls who amassed so much
influence under Boris Yeltsin that they became known as Russia's
''oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a class of oligarchs will cease to exist,'' he said. ''We
will work with all layers of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The centrist Unity political party, which strongly backs Putin,
issued a call Saturday to young people to vote for Putin, urging
them not to be apathetic or assume the election outcome is a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ''has a historic chance to pull Russia out of crisis and
lead the country on the path of dynamic and stable development,''
the movement said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, whose tough stance on the war in Chechnya has buoyed his
popularity, said he will not repeat the mistakes of the last
Chechen war, when Russian forces were defeated by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 withdrawal from Chechnya was a mistake, he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ''We have already left
once,'' he said. ''I do not want to call it a crime or give my
assessment of the fact, but it was a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said most of the rebel forces in Chechnya have been
eliminated, and some Russian troops could soon be withdrawn. But he
said rebels could still unite into groups and commit terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means that we will leave the amount of armed forces
necessary to deal with these issues,'' he said.
