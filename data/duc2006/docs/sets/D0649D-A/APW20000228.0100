<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Targets Corruption  </HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist Party head
Gennady Zyuganov on Monday agreed on at least one thing in their races for the
presidency -- Russia has to eliminate its oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   Corruption reaches into the highest levels of government in Russia, where a
powerful, wealthy elite has formed while many ordinary people have sunk into
deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is crucial for us to create equal conditions for all, so that nobody
can attach himself to the power and use these advantages for himself,'' Putin
said in a meeting with workers in his campaign for the March 26 election.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov meanwhile told a news conference that he is fighting ``fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, employing some colloquially colorful phrasing, also said Russia needs
``not simply to knock off (corrupt officials), but to know who must be knocked
off and in what way,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin and his predecessors have talked tough about tackling corruption, but
none have followed up with action against high-level functionaries suspected of
bribe-taking, kickbacks and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
	   Government policies are widely believed to be manipulated by a group of
``oligarchs'' -- powerful tycoons with close government connections -- who are
widely despised in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has not yet released an election program, although he published an
open letter to voters last week, promising to build a strong state, combat
crime, protect private property, streamline the government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Putin again said he would not nationalize private assets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guarantees of property rights are not subject to any revision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Zyuganov -- who is trailing a distant second behind Putin in most
opinion polls -- criticized Putin's lack of a detailed platform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are few specific proposals, mostly good intentions,'' Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
	   His own platform remains little changed since his losing 1996 presidential
bid, calling for partial nationalization of oil and natural resources companies
to raise pensions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm fighting the fat cats, the security regime and all the misinformation
that comes whenever there is an election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uncertainty about Putin's personal views and political program does not seem
to have sapped his electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released Monday by the independent Romir agency indicated that about
nearly 60 percent of Russians were ready to vote for Putin, with 23 percent
planning to back Zyuganov. The poll claimed a margin of error of about 4
percentage points.
