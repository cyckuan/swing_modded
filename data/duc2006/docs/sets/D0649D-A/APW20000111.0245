<HEADLINE> Putin To Raise Russian Pensions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's government will boost pensions by 20 percent as of
Feb. 1, acting President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday in an apparent appeal to
voters ahead of March presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's last pension hike, a 15 percent rise, came in October.
Officials at the time promised a 12 percent increase in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said the raise was a routine response to higher-than-expected tax
collection at the end of last year, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We make decisions about increasing pensions every year,'' Putin said. ``As
a result of the government's work in the fourth quarter, we managed not only to
fulfill, but also significantly exceed our promises.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement comes 10 weeks before the March 26 presidential election,
which Putin is heavily favored to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Boris Yeltsin, Putin's predecessor, cash-strapped federal and local
agencies often delayed pensions and salaries for several months. But revenues
from high world oil prices have helped the government pay out pensions in recent
months. Russia is a major oil exporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Pensions currently average the equivalent of $17.50 a month, below the
official poverty line, and are the only income for many elderly Russians.
Pensions also often lag behind inflation, which was 36.5 percent in 1999.
