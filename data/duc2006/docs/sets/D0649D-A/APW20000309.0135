<HEADLINE> Putin To Unveil Economic Program  </HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The economic program that acting President
Vladimir Putin has said he will unveil before this month's
elections will combine liberalization measures with stronger state
regulation, the man heading its development said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand, we need deregulation, but, on the other hand,
the state's role must be increased,'' German Gref, the head of the
Center of Strategic Research think-tank, said on Echo of Moscow
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is widely considered to be a shoo-in in the March 26
balloting, despite his vague stance on how to address many of
Russia's complex economic problems. He has promised to release the
program before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been recording support of about 60 percent in
pre-election opinion polls, against about 20 percent for Communist
Gennady Zyuganov, his nearest challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning by all 12 candidates has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Gref, who worked alongside Putin in the St. Petersburg city
government, said the government must streamline control over its
assets and strengthen its traditional functions, such as law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he argued, the state must stop meddling in
every aspect of private business and requiring permission for every
small step. ''We must end an omnipresent state control of
businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graf said his think-tank regularly reports to Putin and receives
his guidance.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say when the program will be unveiled. Zyuganov has
repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to release his program.
</P>
<P>
   Gref said that Putin's program will be aimed at creating
conditions for steady economic growth that would bring Russia back
to the ranks of major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who chaired a Cabinet session Thursday, used the occasion
to promise that the government will pay expenses of several hundred
World War II veterans from the former Soviet republics who are to
come to Moscow in May to take part in celebrations marking the end
of that war.
