<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Resignation Seen As Move to Boost Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and
many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, announced by Yeltsin over the national
television, also sent the Russian stock market soaring and the
ruble, the national currency, stumbled against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made up his mind to step down Thursday night and
skipped the state dinner in the Kremlin to consider the move, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His resignation is expected to further boost the approval rate
of Putin, who has seen his popularity skyrocketing over the past
few months amid a federal military campaign against rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already transferred the so-called nuclear button
briefcase to Putin, government spokesman Mikhail Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
The transfer is a constitutional procedure, as following
resignation Yeltsin ceased to be the commander-in-chief of the
Russian armed forces. These functions will now be performed by
Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin, Yeltsin's appointed successor, has announced that he
would participate in the next presidential race, now moved to
March with Yeltsin's succession.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, a new presidential election
must be held within 90 days following the early resignation of a
sitting president.
</P>
<P>
"Having resigned, Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) gives Putin an
absolutely real chance to become the future Russian president,"
said Boris Nemsov, leader of the pro-Kremlin Union of Right-Wing
Forces.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin has left as impressively as he came. This was done
not only impressively but also with fine timing: after the
parliamentary elections and before the New Year," Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government election blocs made a strong showing in the
contest for the 450 seats in the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) on December 19, a result also seen as a plus to
Putin's bid to run for president.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, also expressed the
belief that Yeltsin's resignation will pave the way for Putin's
race into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"There are three months until the elections and I do not see
any serious opponents to Putin," Interfax quoted Stepashin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin left the Kremlin at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT) and
went for his country residence in Gorky-9 near Moscow.
