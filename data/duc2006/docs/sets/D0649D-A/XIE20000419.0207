<HEADLINE> Roundup: Putin Visit Sheds Light on Russian Foreign Policy Orientation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin returned to Moscow early Wednesday after a three-day working
visit to Belarus, Britain and Ukraine, a visit that showed
Moscow's foreign policy priorities on ties with the CIS countries
and the West.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which groups 12
former Soviet republics, is Russia's backyard and strengthening
relations with fellow CIS member states has all along been a top
priority in Russian foreign policy. It is only too natural that
Belarus and Ukraine, two major CIS members, were put on the list
of Putin's first foreign trip after winning the March 26
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the least critical among Western countries of
Russia's military campaign in its breakaway republic of Chechnya
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, during a recent visit to
Putin's native St. Petersburg, expressed London's willingness to
cooperate with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
For a Russia that is now keen to improve and develop relations
with the West, it is sensible for Putin to choose Britain as the
first Western country to visit.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is Russia's most staunch ally inside the CIS. A treaty
on a union state between Russia and Belarus went into force on
January 26, marking the start of the establishment of their union.
Although the two neighbors still have to work out a unified system
of currency, taxation, the customs, border control, defense and
nationality of their residents, Putin's visit would boost the
progress of the two country's integration.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Minsk, Belarus' capital, Putin and
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko discussed bilateral
ties and the implementation of the union treaty, reaching broad
agreement on cooperation in defense, military technology and
economy, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Most observers see London as the most important leg of Putin's
three-nation tour. As a major Western country, Britain enjoys
close relations with the United States. At a time when France and
Germany distance themselves from Moscow over Chechnya,
strengthening ties with London is of "special significance" to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both Putin and Blair expressed satisfaction with the outcome of
their talks, which touched bilateral ties, Russian economy and
Chechnya. Britain said Putin's London visit represents the
establishment of brand-new strategic relations between the two
countries. The Russian side described Putin's trip as a "key step
forward" in its effort to improve its ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is also one of Russia's strategic partners, but their
ties were marred by many problems in the energy and industrial
sectors. Against the background of intensified efforts by the West
to draw Ukraine closer to its lot, Putin's trip became all the
more important.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, Ukraine owes Gazprom,
Russia's state-owned natural gas monopoly, 2.1 billion U.S.
dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, Putin and Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma told reporters that the two countries could, through joint
efforts, solve the problems hindering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, on his part, said their strategic partnership
determines that the two countries would have fruitful
collaboration in political and economic fields, despite the
outstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
Russia's new foreign policy concept has not been made public
yet, but in his election platform, Putin said he would formulate
foreign policy from the standpoint of national interests.
</P>
<P>
Putin's latest visit and the State Duma's recent ratification
of the long-delayed START II nuclear arms reduction treaty with
the United States offered one a glimpse on Russia's foreign policy
orientation.
</P>
<P>
They indicate that Russia's top foreign policy priorities would
include improving and developing ties with and seeking economic
assistance from the West, repairing and strengthening ties with
other CIS countries to safeguard Russia's "vital interests" in the
so-called near abroad.
