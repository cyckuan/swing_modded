<HEADLINE> First Russian Candidate Registered  </HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the
first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though
polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released Tuesday showed 58 percent of respondents would choose Putin
if the vote were held now, to 15 percent for Zyuganov, Putin's leading opponent.
The nationwide poll conducted Jan. 31 by the All-Russia Opinion Research Center
had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Central Electoral Commission approved Zyuganov's candidacy in a
unanimous vote Tuesday after reviewing the required 500,000 signatures of
support he had submitted, commission spokesman Artyom Golev said. It also
approved his property and income declarations.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the documents filed for his candidacy, Zyuganov has two
apartments and earned $17,000 in 1998-99. He also reported having two bank
accounts, one with $570 and the other with $80. As a member of parliament he
receives a free apartment, car and other perks.
</P>
<P>
	   The income is low by Western standards but is similar to the reported
incomes of other Russian politicians -- and significantly more than that earned
by most ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov, who came in second to incumbent Boris Yeltsin in the 1996
presidential election, predicted Tuesday that the campaign would be unfair. He
said some candidates had easy access to the media while others were denied it --
an indirect reference to state-controlled television channels, which tend to
give Putin blanket, favorable attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist chief also warned that the election results could be
falsified. He repeated his claim that the results of the December parliamentary
elections had been fixed in six regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current authorities are not capable of running elections honestly,''
Zyuganov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is to consider Putin's registration on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, a longtime KGB agent with little governing experience, has been vague
about his electoral platform but is widely liked for his law-and-order image.
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Tuesday, he said, ``One has to be tough and
demanding. ... People are tired of weak government.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also dismissed fears voiced often in the West that he would lead Russia
toward dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply convinced that there will be no development, no future at all
in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of press,'' he said.
Those freedoms ``guarantee the state won't slide into the mire of
totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-nine people have announced their intention to run in the election.
Prominent candidates include Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But the levels of
support for candidates other than Putin and Zyuganov were all in the single
digits, according to the Opinion Research Center poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Another poll, studying reasons for Putin's broad popularity, showed that the
majority of respondents like the 47-year-old Putin for his relatively young age
and good health -- in contrast to the ailing, 69-year-old Yeltsin, who stepped
down Dec. 31. That poll was released by the ROMIR polling agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has been vague about his electoral platform. When asked again about it
Tuesday, he promised to reveal details at a later time.
