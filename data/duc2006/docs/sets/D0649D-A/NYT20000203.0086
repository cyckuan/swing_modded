   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Today the law school campus at the old
Leningrad State University, which is located on the 22nd Line of
Vasilyevsky Island, is dotted with cozy little cafes and
restaurants. But some three decades ago the nearest eatery offered
watery slop that simply went by the name of coffee, and it was
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a twentysomething, bright Vladimir Putin, who is
now Russia's acting president, majored in law there, after
finishing secondary school in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the rambunctious students used to buy cheap
fortified wine in a cellar shop nearby and drink it at home in
their kitchens. True, we don't yet know whether Putin had ever been
observed thus amusing himself. Today the university alumni mostly
recall the energetic prime minister's athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during his undergraduate days Putin actively engaged in
what were at the time exotic martial arts: sambo and judo. In 1974
he won the Leningrad judo championship, earning a title of
Candidate Master of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   While still a sophomore, Putin was entrusted with forming a
college sambo team to compete in a University championship. Because
experienced wrestlers were few and far between, Putin persuaded a
fellow student, who had just learned a few sambo throws and holds,
to take part in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed, but the championship matches ended in
tragedy: Putin's friend injured his cervical vertebra and died in
the hospital several days later. It was a serious blow to young
Putin: He withdrew into himself and remained something of a recluse
until graduation. In any event, none of Putin's former classmates
can now boast of an early, close friendship with the acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final year at the university, Putin was approached by a
Leningrad KGB officer, who invited him to collaborate with state
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed at once,'' Putin recalls in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be said that in those years it was common practice to
recruit future security officers, as well as ordinary informers,
from the ranks of college students. To all appearances, however,
Putin was offered duties more advanced than just informing on his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the latter recall that shortly before graduation,
Putin became the proud owner of a Zaporozhets mini _ a luxury
automobile at the time. Putin personally explained that he had won
the car in a lottery, but few people believed that.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he graduated cum laude in 1975, Putin, along with two
other graduates, was assigned to work as a junior officer at the
KGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. For a long time he worked in
Germany as a KGB undercover agent. Later on, when he was discharged
into the reserve, he got a job at Leningrad University as the
pro-rector's assistant for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 he became an adviser to Anatoly Sobchak, chairman of the
Leningrad city council, and in 1992, chucking his KGB career, Putin
accepted Sobchak's offer of a full-time job at Smolny, the city
hall, becoming head of the St. Petersburg mayor's office External
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence officer turned public figure in St.
Petersburg _ it was news. And Putin practically never turned down
journalists' requests for interviews either. True, Putin's comments
were not particularly popular with readers. In print, he had the
reputation of being articulate but vague.
</P>
<P>
   Some rather cynical journalists dubbed him ``the Smolny gray
eminence.'' In St. Petersburg law-enforcement structures he was
nicknamed ``Stasi.'' Ill-wishers called him simply ``the KGB man,''
and everyone instantly recognized the reference.
</P>
<P>
   It was of course Sobchak who introduced Putin to big-time
politics. They first met on the way to Vasilyevsky Island and in
the mid-1970s, Professor Sobchak was teaching law at the University
where Putin was an undergraduate. Yet they did not become really
close until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They say it was Rector Merkuryev of Leningrad University who
recommended Putin to Sobchak as a highly efficient person. Over the
10 subsequent years Putin lived up to that recommendation: He
followed Sobchak like a shadow to official receptions as well as to
more artistic functions such as concerts by the pop star Alla
Pugacheva, who was greatly admired by the Sobchaks, even though
Putin himself preferred the Mariinsky Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Soon no decision at the city hall was made without Putin's
knowledge. Sobchak, who rarely trusted anyone and who often changed
his opinion about the people around him, seemed to trust Putin
absolutely, saying he was the man one could depend on in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, during a rebellion by the deputies after
President Yeltsin had dissolved the parliament, a contingent of
combat tanks stormed the building. In that atmosphere of chaos,
Putin prudently met the mayor at the airport with a reinforced
security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's
orders, the St. Petersburg NDR (``Our Home Is Russia'') office.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996 Putin ran Sobchak's election campaign and
also sued Alexander Belyayev, who was then the chairman of the
Legislative Assembly. At the height of a gubernatorial election
campaign, he alleged that Sobchak and Putin owned real estate
abroad and kept large amounts of money in foreign banks. Belyayev
had to apologize and soon disappeared from the St. Petersburg
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Sobchak's defeat in the gubernatorial election, Putin
flatly refused to work with the new team, saying that ``it would
look like an act of treachery.'' Sobchak's recent triumphant return
from self-imposed exile in Paris was largely attributed to Putin's
increased clout.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, only a short while ago it was rumored in St.
Petersburg that Putin might become the next governor. Yet,
responding to my question about the likelihood, Sobchak said that
Putin's potential was much bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's former colleagues at Smolny recalls that he
always acted in an admirably manly style: ``If he was friends with
someone, that was great luck, but those he was down on were in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when moving into a new office, Putin never initiated
any redecoration jobs, which never failed to stun some of the
bureaucrats. Thus in St. Petersburg, when he first entered Putin's
office, Sergei Tkachev, the office's former occupant just appointed
chairman of the Smolny External Relations Committee, could not hold
back his astonishment: ``Why didn't he have the furniture changed
at least?''
</P>
<P>
   Putin liked meeting with his friends at a suburban dacha which,
incidentally, burned down as soon as he moved to Moscow and has not
been rebuilt. His wife with two daughters immediately followed her
husband to Moscow. Putin's parents are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in St. Petersburg, Putin has just a handful of friends, and
also his wife's relatives. And of course, the Neva River, the
Mariinsky Opera House and Vasilyevsky Island too.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin is a hero to anyone it is to the military. By his
edict, the defense budget will now have more money for guns and
less for nuclear bombs. At a government cabinet session on Jan. 27,
Putin said defense spending this year will be 50 percent higher
than last year. A bigger defense budget, he stressed, was a
``conscious choice,'' not related to the recent events in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem here runs deeper and it has to do with the fact
that the military has been underfunded for many years in a row,
which has led to negative consequences for the country's defense
capability,'' Putin summed up. He is the first Russian leader in
recent years to state bluntly that Russia intends to put more money
into weapons production and its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Putin's habit to carefully select the venue and
timing for such statements, his address at the cabinet session was
a well-calculated move that clearly had a specific target audience
_ above all, the Russian armed forces, who remain desperate for
support, and the outside world, which is concerned more about the
security of Russian nuclear stockpiles than about tanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years, the defense production and
arms-procurement program has been approved in January. Previously,
neither the Defense Ministry, which places production orders, nor
the defense production enterprises knew what to produce, or in what
volumes, until summer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, 80 percent of all funds was spent on the
Strategic Nuclear Forces, with conventional weapons programs _
given the chronic underfunding of the defense sector _ getting just
a pittance. This year, according to Ilya Klebanov, vice premier in
charge of the military-industrial complex, 30 percent of the
defense budget will be spent on the nuclear forces while the
remaining 70 percent, on conventional weapons systems. Considerable
sums will be spent on R&AMP;D projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin denies the new defense budget is linked to the
war in Chechnya, there is a link. The war has apparently affected
the military's kitty. After the outbreak of the second military
campaign in Chechnya, the state disbursed, as a matter of urgency,
an extra 4 billion rubles for arms procurement programs and
immediately raised the question of increasing the share of defense
spending in the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   True, the government has yet to find the money _ not just on
paper. Before the operation in Chechnya began, the defense sector
received only 46 percent of the earmarked funding, whereas by the
end of last year this figure had grown to 86 percent, which is an
all-time record in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Putin remains a unique candidate on the scene. For the
first time since the 1917 Revolution, the next head of state in
Russia could be a person born in a capital city _ in Putin's case,
in Leningrad on Oct. 7, 1952. And not in snobbish Moscow either,
but in Europeanized St. Petersburg.
