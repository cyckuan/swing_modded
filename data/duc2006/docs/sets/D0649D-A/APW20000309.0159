<HEADLINE> Putin's Presidential Campaign Slick  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer

   IVANOVO, Russia (AP) -- For a candidate who insists he's too busy
being president to campaign, Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of
time on the road, running one of the slickest election campaigns
Russians have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the vast country on trips described as official
business, the acting president has reached out to interest groups,
building support for the March 26 presidential election -- and
giving himself an apparently unbeatable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the executive must prove their worth by their
concrete deeds, not advertising,'' Putin told reporters, insisting
that he was not campaigning on a visit this week to Ivanovo.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working with Russia's disillusioned voters, who
are tired of empty promises after a decade of democracy following
the Soviet collapse. Putin's image as a tough leader who can get
things done goes down well with voters, even though he rarely
offers specific policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a master of his word, who doesn't give empty promises,''
said Lyuba Belova, 34, a worker at the New Ivanovo weaving plant,
which Putin visited. ''So what if he's a former KGB man? That means
he's a well-disciplined person, and discipline is what our country
needs most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's 11 rivals seem almost invisible. The acting president
has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion
polls say.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin's activities as
president and his trips to the provinces, there are few signs that
Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election. Putin has
not accepted Zyuganov's challenge to debate him and issues have
barely surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 election, when Boris Yeltsin defeated Zyuganov
by dwelling on fears of a Communist comeback, few people take the
Communists seriously anymore. Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and named
Putin acting president, giving him a big edge at winning a full
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only elderly people nostalgic of the old times will vote for
Zyuganov,'' said Yelena Rusova, another worker at the weaving
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' platforms are vague, with Putin and his rivals
all pledging to ensure economic growth,improve miserable living
standards, combat corruption and crime, and restore Russia as a
great power.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov talks about rolling back market reforms and reviving
Soviet-era economic controls. Putin says he will go on with market
reform, while boosting state economic oversight to ensure everyone
gets a fair break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice isn't between Putin and Zyuganov. It's a question
of to be or not to be for Russia,'' the Communist chief said
recently, adding that Putin's program ''is murderous for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of economic experts, including reformers, has been
working out an economic program for Putin, but it's not clear when
it will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it would be offered to the public even before the
election,'' Putin said on a recent trip, then quickly added:
''Surely, before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has focused on reaching out to the country's various
interest groups, such as local government officials, farm workers
and factory crews, showing interest in the problems each segment
faces.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivanovo, a major textile center 190 miles east of Moscow,
Putin was targeting two groups at once -- industrial workers and
women. So many women work in the city that it is known as ''The
City of Brides.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit coincided with International Women's Day on Wednesday
-- a national holiday when women traditionally receive gifts and
flowers. Putin spoke about reviving the textile industry, then
complimented his mostly female audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The official purpose of this trip is to attend an official
meeting dedicated to prospects of light industries, but the real
reason is to visit Ivanovo ... the women's capital -- on the eve of
March 8,'' he said Tuesday as the hall burst into applause. ''We
owe everything to women.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin prefers to address big official gatherings and rarely
seems comfortable chatting with people, rarely going out to press
the flesh. Not that the voters seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a lot of work to do, he has no time to lose,'' Belova
said as Putin rushed through her workshop without stopping to talk
to any of the admiring workers.
