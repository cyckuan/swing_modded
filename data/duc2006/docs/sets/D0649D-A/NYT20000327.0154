 &HT;    VICTORIOUS PUTIN REMAINS VAGUE ON PLANS TO RESTORE RUSSIAN

<P>
   MOSCOW _ An energetic-looking President-elect Vladimir Putin
arrived at work Monday to meet with government leaders, but instead
of triumphant speeches about his election victory, Putin shed no
light about which way he'll lead the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of expectations is very high. People are tired and
struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but
miracles don't happen,'' he said. ``A lot of things that will lead
to many controversies need to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials
named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic
presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov finished in second place
with a stronger-than-expected 29 percent, and liberal Gregory
Yavlinsky was third with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's victory has been expected since former
President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on Dec. 31, the novice
politician appeared unprepared with the first tough tasks of
office, namely nominating a new prime minister and Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's chief of staff, Dmitry Kozak, said Putin would wait to
publish his economic plan and list of ministerial candidates until
after his inauguration, which the Central Election Commission
tentatively scheduled for May 5. Putin cannot officially call
himself president until that time.
</P>
<P>
   Putin gave no hints Monday as to who he favors to head his new
government, saying only that cooperation is needed from all
political parties and that the results of the elections will have
to figure into his decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this signalled Putin's willingness to make room
for political opposition in the new government, especially the
Communists, with whom Putin's parliamentary bloc already has a
strategic alliance in the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Putin extended an olive branch to his rivals,
Zyuganov spent the day vilifying the elections as a sham, full of
gross violations. ``They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to
cheat citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's election commission as well as the head of the team of
international observers led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, denied the allegations, saying if
minor irregularities occurred they would not change the overall
results.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE's special representative in charge of the observer
mission, Helle Degn, characterized the elections as fair ``to a
certain degree,'' calling into question biased media coverage of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 47, a virtual unknown in the Russian political world
until becoming prime minister in August, received flattering and
blanket coverage by the country's most influential broadcasters _
state-run television stations ORT and RTR _ throughout the
three-month campaign, which began after former President Boris
Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned on Dec. 31. Putin's opponents,
meanwhile, found themselves the target of negative attacks on TV,
or simply not shown at
</P>
<P>
   all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's successful manipulation of the media, to forward the
government's war in the rebellious republic of Chechnya and to
publicize his preferred campaign image of a tough-talking,
effective leader, is one of the many reasons detractors fear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's full of words _ promises to end corruption, promises to
build our society again _ but we don't know who he really is or who
stands behind him,'' said Alexei Slavin, a Russian voter who chose
``None of the Above'' on the ballot sheet as a protest against
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The former KGB officer's victory came as a relief to many
Russians after Yeltsin's poor health and the legacy of corruption
allegations within his family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people from Yeltsin's Kremlin administration widely
considered to have tight relations with the country's so-called
``oligarchs'' still held their jobs Monday morning. This fact
causes concern among anti-Putin observers that the country was in
for not a new era, like Putin promised voters, but four more years
of the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see him get rid of the rot (the oligarchs and their
Kremlin connections). Then maybe I'll change my mind'' about him,
said political analyst Lilia Schvetsova from the Moscow Carnegie
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has expressed uncertainty
over how vigorously Putin will pursue democratic change, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that his words have the
right tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians evidently want to live in a more orderly society. The
United States will watch closely to see how former intelligence
officer Vladimir Putin will try to instill this order as
president,'' she said in an interview with CNN. ``I think we're
going to have to see'' how strong Putin's commitment to democracy
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, born Oct. 7, 1952, is a fluent German speaker. He is
married and has two children.
