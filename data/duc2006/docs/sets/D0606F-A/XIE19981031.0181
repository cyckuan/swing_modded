BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday
called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger
because of the climate change.
</P>
<P>
The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the
measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less
contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must
commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF
independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
</P>
<P>
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up
threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate
change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
</P>
<P>
He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the
forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid
climate change.
</P>
<P>
The WWF, the biggest organization in the world for the
conservation of nature, has 4.7 million employees who work in 96
countries in the world. The organization also has a status of
official observer in the United Nations.
