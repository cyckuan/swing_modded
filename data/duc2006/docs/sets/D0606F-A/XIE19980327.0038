<HEADLINE> UNEP Helps Africa Cope with Climate Change </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) has undertaken various activities in Africa to
address concerns of the continent in connection with climate
variability and change, a UNEP official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here at the UNEP headquarters, Alex
Alusa, program officer of UNEP atmosphere unit, said that UNEP
had organized seminars to help African leaders in planning and
preparing for droughts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc Working Group on the El Nino has been set up to
review state of the science on El Nino and provide El Nino
information to African countries as part of an Early Warning
System, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects
of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate
variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts
of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of
countries.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the
Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as
long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are
allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming
will occur and occasion changes in the climate system."
</P>
<P>
The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean
ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause
significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species
distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Many organisms in the deserts are already near their tolerance
limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under hotter
conditions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread
poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and
over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Although adaptation options theoretically are available, Alusa
said, in practice the human, infrastructural and economic
response capacity to effect timely response actions may well be
beyond the economic means of some countries.
</P>
<P>
As farming depends entirely on the quality of the rainy season
in most African countries, increased droughts could seriously
impact the availability of food for the continent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP official, a warmer environment could
open up new areas for malaria and increase the incidence of
yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Africa was expected to be at risk primarily
from increased incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced
nutritional status.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer also addressed the press
conference, saying that he was committed to making UNEP an
integral voice for the environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Global Environment Facility (FEF) had
given UNEP a total of 750 million U.S. Dollars to combat forest
fires in Indonesia and Brazil.
