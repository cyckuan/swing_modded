<HEADLINE> Insurers Call for Quick Cuts in Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Insurance companies warned here on
Tuesday of enormous economic costs if global actions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions come too slowly.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by about 60 insurance companies in a
position paper they presented Tuesday to an international
negotiating conference on climate change resumed in Geneva on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The insurers expressed their concern that while the effect of
climate change on the frequency or severity of extreme weather
events remains unknown, it is clear that even small shifts in
regional climate zones or storm patterns could lead to increased
property damage.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that climate change could potentially
have large implications for investment activities as society
anticipates and adapts to new climate regime.
</P>
<P>
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions
to reduce the risks of climate change. According to them, the most
efficient precautionary measure is an early and substantial
reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
They also urged governments to promote scientific research that
will establish what threshold level of atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases should be considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the insurance industry is
currently under stress from a series of "Billion Dollar" storms
since 1987. This has led to dramatic increases in claims, reduced
availability of insurance, and higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
"When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to
worry, so should we," commented Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Exective
Director of the UN Environment Programme.
</P>
<P>
"While some industries think more about the costs of taking
action against climate change, insurers know from experience how
expensive it can be when people fail to protect themselves
adequately from risks," she added.
</P>
<P>
How fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the focus of the
latest negotiating conference, known officially as the second
session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
In the treaty, which was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro, industrialized countries agreed to take measures
to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. But some environmental reports said almost none of them
will meet that target.
</P>
<P>
While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are
calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major
industries in some countries are urging their governments to take
a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs
and growth before the problem is better understood.
