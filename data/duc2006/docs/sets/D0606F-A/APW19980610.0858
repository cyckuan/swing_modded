	   Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause
the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average
global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the
next century, a new scientific study predicted recently. Using
recent technological advances in climate modelling and new
scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief
scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made
three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic
Ice Sheet. In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would
raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing
major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest
issue of the scientific journal Nature.' In the other scenario, the
internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting
to slow down.
	   With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole,
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a
large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,''
Oppenheimer said. Changes in ocean temperature and circulation
expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large
ice sheet, as early as next century, he said. The West Antarctic
Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when
scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases
might cause its disintegration. Greenhouse gas emissions -
including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and
oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the
warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
	   In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the
United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global
temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius
during the next century. Last year, scientists declared 1997 the
warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years
set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that
greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature. Over
time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the
increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves,
and droughts, the scientists said. To deal with this threat 38
industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in
Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by
about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
	   While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of
scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of
the collapse' or melting.' But Oppenheimer warned that, as
countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the
potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large
and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date. Conflicting
scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice
caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said. Until recently,
scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as
a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting. Similarly the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the
past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating
ice, he added.
	   In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these
new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of
two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that
had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of
local atmospheric warming. While most scientists agreed that the
ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt
and what the consequences would be. In an effort to simplify the
controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the
three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively
unstable sheet of ice. Each of the three most likely possibilities
varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded
to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice
shelves in the area. Using the climate change predictions of the
Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas
emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible
scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
	   While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the
twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process
could begin in as early as 50 years. Some reports said the process
already had begun. In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that
internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the
melting to slow down.
