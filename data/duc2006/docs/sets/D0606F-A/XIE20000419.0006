<HEADLINE> Arctic Town Sinking as Result of Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arctic town of Sachs Harbour
in Canada on the west coast of Banks Island is slowly sinking into
the sea as a result of global warming, the National Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Climate change in the past decade has brought milder winters,
warmer summers and a later freeze-up to soften the permafrost that
supports the Arctic town.
</P>
<P>
Rosemarie Kuptana, an Inuit leader, was quoted as saying the
situation has made it difficult for hunters to travel over an
increasingly muddy landscape.
</P>
<P>
"If this rate of change continues, our lifestyle may forever
change because our communities are sinking with the melting
permafrost," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kuptana is leading an international project to collect Inuit
observations about climate change in her hometown of Sachs Harbour.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest reaches of the Arctic, she said that
experienced hunters have fallen through unusually thin ice. The
region is also seeing the appearance of species such as robins,
barn swallows, beetles and sandflies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Inuit locals have begun to suffer allergies from
white pine pollen, which has never before reached Banks Island.
</P>
<P>
She urged more attention to the issue of global warming, saying,
"What happens in the Arctic environment is what is in store for
other regions of the world."
