   WASHINGTON _ Global warming is not making some people in the
nation's coldest state happy.
</P>
<P>
   As higher temperatures melt some of the ice in Alaska, natives
who live in or near the Arctic Circle said here Wednesday they are
worried that their way of life will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Golongergen, 43, a community development worker in
Savoonga, an island town in the Bering Sea, said at a news
conference that as the ice melts, hunting gets more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sons who are being taught, hands on, by their
father, uncles (and other elders) to hunt walrus, seal, whale,
birds and fish,'' she said. ``But this year the ice packs left
sooner. There was very little game for them to hunt, (which) cut
short our food supply'' and the time that her sons had to learn
``how to continue this way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We do not really understand the science or the
politics of environmental change, but it affects our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kulowiyi, 76, a whaling captain also from Savoonga, said
ice around the village is slowly getting thinner year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never go out (to hunt) this year by walking on the ice,''
he said. ``It's too dangerous for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So in order to hunt, the men must travel 50 to 80 miles from the
village, which makes the trips expensive for them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy ``Kalee'' Kreider, director of the U.S. global warming
campaign for Greenpeace, an environmental organization which
sponsored the news conference, said, ``In most of the lower 48
states, ice is seen as bad. That's not the way things are seen in
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report on global climate change released by Greenpeace
said that as the seas warm up and glaciers melt, animals such as
walruses seals, and caribous move north to colder temperatures.
These animals are a staple food for villagers in the Bering and
Chukchi Seas region near Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The report said some plants are dying as tundra dries out
because permafrost, ground that is frozen all year, is thawing and
water is draining off. Kreider also said the pesky sprucebark
beetle has moved further north as temperatures climb. She said it
has already ``devastated a huge swathe of forest in southern Alaska
(and) ... as far north as Fairbanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cited interviews with natives in eight villages in
the Bering and Chukchi Seas.
</P>
<P>
   Kreider said Greenpeace expects Congress to hold hearings in
January on the Alaskan climate change and that some of the people
quoted in the report will testify.
</P>
<P>
   She urged U.S. approval of the so-called Kyoto Protocol, an
accord reached by negotiators around the world last December that
would require industrial nations to make significant cuts in carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the
world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also said that upper Arctic ice, which had been 2
meters (6 1/2 feet) to 3 meters (just under 9 feet) thick, now
averages about 1.5 meters (under 5 feet) or less.
