WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Long-term climate change
such as global warming could have major impacts on human health,
the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker,
Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

Writing in the Washington Post Monday when the Fourth Session
of the Conference of the Parties to U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change begins in Buenos Aires, the U.S. scientist said that
global warming chould affect everything from energy use and
transportation to water resource management and agriculture to
international trade and development.

Baker said that over the past century, greenhouse gases have
increased steadly: fossil fuel combustion now accounts for about
85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time,
agriculture, changing land-use patterns and deforestation are
playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases. Since 1860, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent.
Overall emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing at about
1 percent each year, he said.

On the risks of a warmer world, Baker said that a relatively
small change in mean global temperature can lead to a large
change in extreme events. This year's El Nino has increased
rainfall, flooding and droughts. Increased duration and
frequency of heat waves would heighten mortality rates, and the
potential for transmitting serious infectious diseases would be
increased, Baker said.

According to a scientific assessment, the globally averaged
temperature will increase about 2 to 6 degrees by the year 2100.
The related rise in sea level will be about 6 to 37 inches. With
50 percent of the U.S. population and 50 to 70 percent of the
global population currently living in coastal areas, future sea
level rises, alterations in storm patterns and higher storm
surges could have devastating effects. Even with current global
populations, a 20-inch rise in the sea level without adaptive
measures would directly threaten 92 million people, wrote
Director Baker.
