<HEADLINE> Ocean Warming May Threaten Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by  
global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their 
Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as 
early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not  
statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said 
Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research 
Institute in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean  
waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among 
salmon. It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species 
that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't fully realize what's happening ... but these are the  
sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, 
head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National 
Department of Fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced  
that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the 
possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine 
ecosystem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the  
reasons remain in dispute. Some scientists argue it reflects 
broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but 
others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, 
including the El Nino phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had  
dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists 
said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and 
the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in  
Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year. 
Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia 
have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he 
said. And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to 
spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the  
warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their 
energy and strength. ``We're starting to see a very troubling 
perspective on this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998  
produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific 
waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in 
the food chain. The reduced size of returning salmon and the 
decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader  
global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced 
northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific 
habitat. While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, 
``the early stages are already here,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be  
cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever 
recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, 
suggesting a broader climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry.
