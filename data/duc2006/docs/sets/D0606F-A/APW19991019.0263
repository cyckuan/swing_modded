	GENEVA (AP) -- Cities including New York and Tokyo may face  
flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought 
and Australia's Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is 
done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature 
warned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group urged governments meeting in Germany  
next week to honor earlier pledges to cut emissions of carbon 
dioxide -- one of the main greenhouse gases -- by implementing tough 
energy-saving policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence for the warming of our planet over the last 200 years  
is now overwhelming,'' said a WWF statement. ``With no action to 
curb emissions, the climate on earth over the next century could 
become warmer than any the human species has lived through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said China's Giant Panda and the Arctic polar bear were among  
the species at risk of extinction from global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain's  
University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate 
change scenarios over the next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
	It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters  
of an inch to four inches per decade. This would threaten low-lying 
U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami 
with flooding. The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka -- among 
others -- would also be at risk, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Large areas of the Amazon would become more susceptible to  
forest fires. Drought would also likely affect Argentina, southern 
Mexico and Central America. Rising sea temperatures by 2010 
threatened the very survival of the Australian Great Barrier Reef. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists generally agree that temperatures are rising -- with  
1998 being the warmest year on record. But there is no consensus on 
how much man is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the precise contribution of human activities to  
global warming cannot yet be stated with confidence, it is clear 
the planet would not be warming as rapidly if humans were not 
currently emitting about 6.8 billion tons of carbon into the 
atmosphere each year,'' said the WWF report. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1997 agreement reached in the Japanese city of Kyoto,  
industrialized nations agreed to reduce their carbon dioxide 
emissions by five percent between 2008 and 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from 150 countries meet later this month in Bonn  
to work on ways of implementing the Kyoto deal prior to a November 
2000 meeting in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton signed the Kyoto agreement, he has not  
sought its ratification because of widespread opposition in the 
Senate. Critics say it will cost too much to implement while 
developing countries will be allowed to let greenhouse emissions 
grow.
