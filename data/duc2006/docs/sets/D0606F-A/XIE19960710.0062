<HEADLINE> Climate Change Posing Threat to Human Health </HEADLINE>

GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is likely to disturb
various natural and ecological systems, posing serious threat to
human health, said a report jointly released Tuesday by relevant
United Nations specialized agencies at a session on global warming
issue.
</P>
<P>
"In destablizing the world's climate and its dependent
ecosystems, we are posing new and widespread risks to human
health", said the report, which assesses potential health
consequences of human-induced climate change, while conceding that
much more research needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly
quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases
such as carbon dioxide. The least direct health effects would be
those due to socioeconomic disruption caused by environmental
deterioration, the most direct would be those caused by heatwaves,
storms and floods.
</P>
<P>
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as
the climate is getting warmer and wetter. Experts predict a 1-3
centigrade degree growth in global mean surface temperature by the
year 2100, and that we would have higher sea level, more heavy
rainfalls, more floods, more bushfires, as well as longer and more
severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
Hot weather would lead to up to several thousand extra
heat-related deaths annually by around 2050 in many big cities
worldwide. The increase would outweigh the decline in
winter-related mortality.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects
due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon
agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
</P>
<P>
Climate change allows disease vectors to extend territory,
helping infectious diseases spread and kill more people. In the
next century, it would increase the global incidence of malaria by
50 to 80 million additional cases annually, and the vulnerable
population would rise from the current 45 percent to about 60
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of food-and water-related infections such as
cholera would also grow, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical
regions, following changes in water distribution, temperature and
the proliferation of microorganisms, the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some
types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the
increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as
cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
</P>
<P>
In some regions, warmer and wetter climate could also lead to
higher concentration in air of various pollens and spores with a
possible impact on allergic disorders, such as hay fever and
asthma.
</P>
<P>
Sustained stratospheric ozone depletion -- a factor closely
related to climate change, which leads to increased exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, would cause increased cases of skin cancer,
and possibly of ocular lesions, such as cataracts.
</P>
<P>
It may also impair human immune system, said the report, which
was released at the July 8-19 session in Geneva of the Conference
of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
