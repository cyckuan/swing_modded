<HEADLINE> Global Warming Badly Hits Mediterranean: greenpeace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Global warming weather will
critically undermine efforts for sustainable development in Lebanon
and other Mediterranean literal states, the Greenpeace
Mediterranean has said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Daily Star today quoted a report issued by Greenpeace
Mediterranean in Lebanon on Thursday entitled "Climate change and
the Mediterranean region" as saying that climate change will add
to existing problems of desertification, water scarcity, and food
production in the region.
</P>
<P>
As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans
expand. The level of much of the Mediterranean could rise by
close to one meter by 2100, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the worst affected areas will be
the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in
Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level.
</P>
<P>
It said that the first impact of climate change will be
felt in the Mediterranean water resource system. Reductions in
water availability would hit southern Mediterranean countries the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and
Lebanon, water availability is already near the 1,000 cubic
meters per person per year benchmark for water scarcity, and
the report warns that live-stock production would suffer as
rangeland deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
The 55-page report added that rising carbon dioxide (CO2) will
also introduce new threats to human health, ecosystems and
national economies.
</P>
<P>
As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and
severity of drought could increase across the region.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures could rise by over four degrees centigrade by
2100 over many of the inland areas and by more than this
over the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The report called on all Mediterranean states to immediately
demand industrialized countries adopt legally-binding obligations at
the Kyoto Climate Conference in Japan next month to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by
2005.
