<HEADLINE> Report: Global Warming a Threat  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Global warming could fundamentally transform a
third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this
century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an
international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, researchers for the World Wide Fund for Nature
-- known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada
-- singled out the Arctic and northern latitudes as the most
vulnerable to the changing climate. They estimated 20 percent of
the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus
and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce
and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the
atmosphere is not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and
other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the
atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come
under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,''
said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of
the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where
climate change is expected to occur fastest, could lose 70 percent
of their habitat -- a level that rises to 82 percent for Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   In several countries -- including Russia, Sweden, Finland,
Estonia, Latvia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia -- and
in seven Canadian provinces and territories, more than half the
existing habitat is at risk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of
Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah,
Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The projected habitat changes and species extinctions would not
be limited to northern latitudes, however. Coastal and island areas
would be at risk from warming oceans and rising waters, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains
contentious. According to a study published in the July issue of
the Dutch journal Climate Change, Arctic temperatures in the late
20th century were the warmest in four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But, critics of the global warming theory argue there's little
evidence that forces other than natural temperature swings are at
work. They have also argued that while ground monitors have shown a
sharp increase in Earth's temperatures, satellite and weather
balloon observations have shown little or no warming -- a
discrepancy that has still not been fully explained.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of
environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including
air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea
ice, glaciers and plant growth.
</P>
<P>
   They said parts of Alaska and Eurasia had warmed ''alarmingly''
-- by as much as 11 degrees -- during winter months during the last
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a
major warming is affecting the Arctic environment,'' said Michael
T. Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington,
which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report -- written by Markham and University of
Toronto professor Jay Malcolm -- used computer models to simulate
global climate and vegetation change under a variety of conditions.
Its projections are based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere doubling from pre-industrial levels by the year
2100.
</P>
<P>
   And even that estimate is optimistic, the report said. Current
concentrations of carbon dioxide -- the gas primarily responsible
for global warming -- are about 30 percent higher than
pre-industrial levels, and could hit double the pre-industrial
level by 2050, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of habitat would place many plant and animal species in
a race for their lives, and scientists do not yet know whether they
would be able to migrate fast enough to outrun the change. The
report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to
migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''A considerable portion of the globe could eventually become
devoid of tree cover,'' the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the most vulnerable species are those who live
in isolated or fragmented habitats, including the Gelada baboon of
Ethiopia; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the monarch
butterfly, which spends its winters in Mexico; and the spoon-billed
sandpiper of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The report is designed to pressure politicians ahead of
November's international climate-change summit in the Dutch city of
The Hague, at which politicians will attempt to ratify the 1997
Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many countries are trying to find loopholes in the Kyoto
agreement,'' said Andrew Kerr of the WWF's Climate Change campaign.
''They should know that the problem is much more of an immediate
threat than they realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Markham: ''Speed kills. We're night-driving on a mountain
road with the lights switched off.''
