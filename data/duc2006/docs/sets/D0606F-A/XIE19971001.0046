<HEADLINE> World Scientists Call for Action on Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 world senior
scientists at a summit here today called on world leaders to act
immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of
human-induced global warming.
</P>
<P>
A consensus declaration "World Scientists' Call for Action at
Kyoto," signed by more than 1,500 scientists, was presented to the
U.S. government at the Summit on Climate Change in Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no doubt about the conclusions of the scientific
community: the threat of global warming is very real and action is
needed immediately," said Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, chairman
of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "It is a grave error to
believe that we can continue to procrastinate."
</P>
<P>
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world
leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to
negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the
climate.
</P>
<P>
The scientists meeting today was held six days before a White
House conference to propose global actions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The scientists' declaration urged all government leaders to
demonstrate a new commitment to protecting the global environment
for future generations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stated that global warming is underway and the
overuse of fossil fuels is partly to blame. It said that climate
change is projected to raise sea levels; increase the likelihood
of more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts; and endanger human
health by greater exposure to heat waves and encroachment of
tropical diseases to higher latitudes.
</P>
<P>
Further, the declaration said, climate change is likely to
exacerbate food shortages and spread undernutrition by adversely
affecting water supplies, soil conditions, temperature tolerances,
and growing seasons.
</P>
<P>
Climate change will also accelerate the appalling pace at which
species are now disappearing, especially in vulnerable ecosystems,
it said, adding that possibly one-third of all species may be lost
before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent since
preindustrial times. Over the same period, atmospheric methane has
risen by 145 percent, mostly from agricultural activities like
growing rice and raising cattle.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the earth's average surface temperature will
increase by 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years, in
addition to the increase of 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius that has
already occurred since 1860.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that even if people stopped emitting
heat-trapping gases now, the climate wouldn't stabilize for many
decades because of the gases have already been sent into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
They hold that a strong treaty will be the "first step to
protect future generations from dire prospects that would result
from failure to meet our responsibilities toward them."
</P>
<P>
This is a wake-up call for world leaders. Never before has the
senior scientific community spoken so boldly on the urgent need to
prevent disruption to our climate," said Nobel laureate Dudley
Herschbath, professor of chemistry at Harvard University.
