WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Global warming in the 21st
century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the
United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased
risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion
of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says.
</P>
<P>
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The
Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides
the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global
warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued
growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average
temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit
by 2100.
</P>
<P>
Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought
will vary widely from region to region, and some natural
ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands
and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some
may disappear entirely, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the
availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to
rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon
dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are
likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on
computer models and historical data, and "American society would
likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts."
</P>
<P>
The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out
by nine federal agencies. The analysis was based largely on two
computer simulations of future climate that often produce very
different or even antithetical results.
