   LONDON _ Global warming could wipe out many species of plants
and animals by the end of the 21st century, the World Wide Fund for
Nature said in a report issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, known in the United States as the World Wildlife Fund,
paints a devastating picture of the ability of species from Arctic
polar bears and walruses, to New England sugar maple trees, to
survive unless they can migrate quickly and adapt to their new
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly at risk, the report says, are species that are rare
or live in mountainous or isolated places. Among those singled out
as vulnerable are the gelada baboon in Ethiopia; the monarch
butterfly, which spends winters in Mexico; the Australian mountain
pygmy possum; the northern spruce in New York state, and the
spoon-billed sandpiper, which breeds in the far northeastern
reaches of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, up to 70 percent of the natural habitat
could be lost, and 20 percent of the species rendered extinct, in
the Arctic and northernmost areas of places like Canada, Russia and
Scandinavia, where warming is predicted to be most rapid.
</P>
<P>
   Places farther to the south, including parts of Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan, could lose more
than half of their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the report says, more than a third of the
existing habitat in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado,
Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas could be
irrevocably altered by global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on the often used, but disputed, assumption
that by the year 2100 there will have been a doubling of the
emissions of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere from the level at
the start of the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid rates of global warming are likely to increase rates of
habitat loss and species extinction, most markedly in the higher
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,'' the report says.
``Extensive areas of habitat may be lost to global warming and many
species may be unable to shift their ranges fast enough to keep
up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jennifer L. Morgan, director of the World Wildlife
Fund Climate Change Campaign in Washington, some species would have
to migrate at a rate 10 times faster than after the last ice age in
order to survive into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climate change is coming at us much faster than many habitats
are going to be able handle,'' Morgan said. ``The speed of change
caused by the change in climate is greater than most ecosystems are
going to be able to adapt to.''
