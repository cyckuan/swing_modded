<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Waning Antarctic Ecosystem </HEADLINE>

CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists warn
that a deteriorating marine ecosystem in the Antarctic and
sub-Antarctic regions foreshadows further natural disasters caused
by global warming.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Macquarie Island near the Antarctic note that
elephant seals and penguins were starving off because of feed
shortage caused by shifting ocean currents and climate changes in
the region, today's Age newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological records show that the average annual ocean
temperature near the island has increased to 5.4 degrees from 4.5
degrees in 1912.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Smith, leader of Australian scientific teams on the
island, said that the annual temperature on Macquarie Island was
rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Macquarie Island is a barometer, it's a measuring device for
large-scale global changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Global change is now a certainty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Higher ocean surface temperatures caused by the greenhouse
effect of the global atmosphere will alter the direction of ocean
currents. As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change
as the marine ecosystem is disrupted. Elephant seals and penguins
population are collapsing as their prey stocks are moving away
from the Antarctic waters.
</P>
<P>
Scientists on Macquarie Island found that the number of
elephant seals and rock hopper penguins has dropped by half in the
past few years. Similar things have happened on Heard Island,
5,400 km west of Macquarie Island. Worst still, the rock hopper
penguin population on Campbell Island near New Zealand has crashed
by 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Hull, a zoologist at the University of Tasmania in
Australia, also found the unprecedented fact this week that 16
percent of eggs of rock hopper penguins on Macquarie Island were
infertile.
</P>
<P>
She said that this was an indication that female penguins were
not getting enough food during their foraging in the ocean. If
food continued to disappear from the ocean, bigger penguins might
also be affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the decline in rock hoppers might be an indicator of
the ecological impact of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Scientists on Macquarie Island fear that a one-degree change of
global temperature would completely change one of the biggest
ecosystem in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the sunniest December ever recorded on the island
halted all major streams on it.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the slightest hint of change at
Macquarie is a clear signal that something significant is
happening in the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean stretches like
a belt around the globe. It is wedged between the Antarctic in the
south, and the Australian, South American and African continents
to the north.
</P>
<P>
"It saddens me to see, in a pristine environment like this, the
deterioration of the natural ecosystem," Smith said.
