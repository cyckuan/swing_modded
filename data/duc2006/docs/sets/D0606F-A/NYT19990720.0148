<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like an omen from the Book of Revelation, a
wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over Colorado late
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been more appropriate. The cloud _ a
harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global
warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields
ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are increasingly convinced that carbon dioxide gas
from the burning of fossil fuels is at least partly responsible for
the marked warming of recent years. And the warming is
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean
chemist Peter G. Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute in Monterey. ``In the next decade, we might see the same
amount of warming that we saw over the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest
projections suggest that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels
could rise one to three feet around North America. Heavier rain and
higher seas would increase coastal damage during storms.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pacific ecosystem, especially fish that benefit much of
the West Coast economy, could be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of data showing there are big changes in marine
ecosystems from the tropics to the poles,'' said biological
oceanographer James P. Barry of the Monterey Bay Institute. For
example, ``if you look at the record from 1992 to now, there's just
been a precipitous decline in salmon stocks _ they're smaller and
have less fat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ An ominous absence of icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping
lanes off Newfoundland might be an early warning sign of global
warming, Science magazine reported July 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York City will suffer repeated flooding in the next
century as global warming raises the sea level, soaking subways and
turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, said a report issued
jointly on June 29 by the Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming might seem like an unreal issue to residents of
Northern California: They are shivering through one of the chillier
summers in long memory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such short-term coolings can't obscure the long-term
signal that it is getting warmer all over the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   New projections of global warming indicate it might be even
slightly worse than originally foreseen. Previously, scientists
expected an average planetary temperature rise of 1.4 to 6.3
degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years. Now they're looking at
a rise of 2.3 to 7.2 degrees, said Tom Wigley, a climatologist at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   That 1-degree difference in projections might seem slight, but
it equals the increase in average global temperature over the last
century, Wigley said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the worsened climate projections is the increased
success in controlling another pollutant: sulfur dioxide. While
carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide cools it. Until
recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would
counterbalance global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hope is fading as nations establish tighter controls on
sulfur dioxide emissions, Wigley said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level
rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study
written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global
Climate Change in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the next century, the rates of rise in temperature and sea
level might occur up to seven times as fast as in the 20th century,
the Pew study adds.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower
atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, professor Gary Thomas of the University of Colorado at
Boulder forecast that as the upper air cooled, beautiful
noctilucent clouds _ common in polar latitudes _ would appear at
southerly latitudes. The clouds are wispy and silvery-blue,
composed of very small ice crystals. They resemble cirrus clouds,
but are far higher, some 50 miles up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 50 miles in the sky over Boulder, a silver-bluish
noctilucent cloud drifted overhead. It is the farthest south such a
cloud has been recorded, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The southerly drift of noctilucent clouds may be the miner's
canary of global warming, a signal of bad times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing are some dramatic effects that are far
greater than what the models are predicting'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and
divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control
measures could hurt a vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are astonished that some members of Congress continue to
ignore warnings from the scientific community,'' said Walt Oechel,
a biology professor and director of the Global Climate Change
Research Group at San Diego State University. ``Climate scientists
from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is
real and could greatly disrupt society.''
