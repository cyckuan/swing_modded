<P>
   Evidence continues to accumulate that the frozen world of the
Arctic and sub-Arctic is thawing, and the findings are spotlighting
two increasingly important questions:
</P>
<P>
   Can what is happening in the Great White North touch off sudden
shifts in climate that will transform weather and disrupt life
throughout the Northern Hemisphere? Is the Arctic a key to the way
in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region
climatic changes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh
water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting
Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere
precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North
Atlantic region, including Europe and eastern North America, is
controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward
from the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier, and
therefore heavier, surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the
vicinity of southern Greenland. It is replaced by warm water from
the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region. Without it, the
relatively mild climate of England, for instance, might be as cold
as that of northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing
Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken
the heat-bearing conveyor belt. This could result in a sudden,
long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature, a
climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the
hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists reported that the current did indeed
weaken or stop at least twice in the past, plunging the region,
which each time had been warming, into cold comparable to that of
an ice age.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, focusing on the present, last week produced
the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the
thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas,
a potential source of fresh water that, once it melts, could help
weaken the heat conveyor.
</P>
<P>
   A third research group, using computerized simulations of the
ocean-atmosphere system, concluded that the present-day thawing of
Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural
causes. The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global
warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like
carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like
coal, oil and natural gas. And they said the rate of sea-ice
melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of
the heat-trapping gases continued at today's rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have
shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the
relatively recent geological past, according to a study reported in
the current issue of Nature by Dr. Carsten Ruhlemann of the
University of Bremen, Germany, and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   By examining chemical clues in ocean sediments, they determined
that in each case, the western tropical North Atlantic was
relatively warm while waters farther north were relatively cold _
as would be expected if the conveyor stopped or weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shutdowns occurred as the world was coming out of
the last ice age. The North Atlantic region's rebound was twice
interrupted by sudden reversions to glacial conditions, once around
15,000 years ago and again around 12,000 years ago, before settling
into the relative warmth that has prevailed for the last 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   The first reversion to glacial cold coincided with an invasion
of the North Atlantic by vast quantities of fresh water in the form
of icebergs, which were released from North America as temperatures
warmed.
</P>
<P>
   Another influx is believed to have touched off the second
reversion to cold, called the Younger Dryas event. That event set
off far-flung reverberations. The climate of the Middle East dried
out so much that food became scarce, forcing the invention of
agriculture, many scientists believe. The New York region became so
chilly that cold-weather trees like spruce took over the landscape
from species like oak.
</P>
<P>
   Could an influx of fresh water brought about by global warming
make that happen again? Recent studies lend the question new
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In one, reported in the December issue of the journal
Geophysical Research Letters, scientists analyzed data collected by
sonar aboard nuclear submarines and found that the floating ice
cover of the Arctic Ocean has become about 40 percent thinner than
it was two to four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another, reported in the current issue of the journal
Science, researchers led by Dr. Ola M. Johannessen of the Nansen
Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway, used
satellite data to measure the area of the Arctic ice sheet. They
found that the perennial ice cover had shrunk by 14 percent over
the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The third study, by nine researchers headed by Dr. Konstantin Y.
Vinnikov of the University of Maryland, analyzed data from five
different sources and found that sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere
as a whole had decreased by about 7 percent in the last 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models of the ocean-atmosphere system reconstructed
this trend accurately, said Dr. Alan Robock of Rutgers University,
a member of the research team. The model simulations also
determined that the trend was much larger than what would be
expected to result from the climate system's natural variability.
This assumes that the models can reproduce natural variability with
some accuracy, an assumption that many experts question.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Robock said, the study provides ``strong support
for the theory that humans are causing the climate to change.''
</P>
<P>
   If the climate is indeed warming because of human activity, many
scientists say, the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic
could increase. Melting ice in the Arctic is not the only potential
contributor. Water from melting glaciers in Greenland and other
Arctic and sub-arctic islands could also contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, scientists reported that the southern half of the
Greenland ice cap was melting back by about two cubic miles a year,
enough to cover Maryland with a sheet 1 foot thick.
</P>
<P>
   (Runoff from melting glaciers contributes to a rising global sea
level. Melting sea ice does not; like an ice cube in a glass of
water, its change in state does not raise the water level.)
</P>
<P>
   A third contributor to an influx of fresh water could be
increased precipitation. A warmer atmosphere causes more water to
evaporate from the oceans, and some scientists believe that some of
this increased atmospheric moisture would be transported to the far
north, where it would produce a heavier runoff of fresh water into
the North Atlantic. This alone, some computer models indicate,
would be enough to weaken the North Atlantic heat conveyor
drastically in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   How much fresh water might be necessary to halt, slow or weaken
the conveyor is a crucial question that scientists cannot yet
answer. Nor do they know how close the world might be to an abrupt
change in the conveyor's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any accurate assessment out there that
would tell us,'' said Dr. Peter Schlosser, a geochemist at the
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   If a warming atmosphere pumped enough fresh water into the ocean
to shut down the conveyor, what would it mean? Schlosser and others
say the magnitude of the resulting climate change might be
different from those observed in the last glacial cycle. But, he
said, ``It might put the system into a state that might be a
precondition for further change.''
</P>
<P>
   What might such a change entail?
</P>
<P>
   Temperature and precipitation patterns could be drastically
altered, much as El Nino alters them, and Schlosser says the
alteration's effects would probably be felt throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. But exactly how the patterns would change and therefore
what their down-to-earth effects would be, he said, is an open
question.
