   Fragrant Night Bloomers
</P>
<P>
   Q. I love fragrant plants, but I don't like bees! Is there
anything I can grow that will perfume the garden without attracting
insects?
</P>
<P>
   A. Perfume that doesn't attract insects would be a horticultural
oxymoron: putting out the come hither for pollinating bugs is a
flower's raison d'etre, and perfume is a large part of the mating
dance. But you can have a fragrant garden low on bees by planting
flowers and shrubs that open their blossoms at night.
</P>
<P>
   Choices range from the small, inconspicuous, but mighty perfumed
annual known as night-blooming stock (Matthiola bicornis) to the
many cultivated varieties of Brugmansia, a tropical tree that can
grow to 10 feet and has been showing up in nurseries under the name
angels' trumpets. All parts of Brugmansia are highly poisonous, but
there's no denying the plant's appeal. Its huge flowers blare
tropical sweetness from dusk until almost sunup. White is the most
common color, and usually the most fragrant, but Brugmansia also
comes in yellow, orange, peaches and pinks.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it from the modern cultivars, which have been
bred to stay open during the day, but old fashioned flowering
tobacco (Nicotiana alata) has a very strong night perfume, and so
does its much taller, more architecturally splendid cousin, N.
sylvestris.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates include moonflower vines, night-blooming
jasmine, evening primrose and the oddball Pardon Me, a day lily
that doesn't get going until the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Brugmansia and matthiola are widely sold. Pardon me (and other
fragrant night bloomers) can be mail ordered from Snow Creek
Daylily Gardens, P.O. Box 2007, 330 P Street, Port Townsend, Wash.
98368, (360) 385-1738, catalog, $3. Pardon Me is also sold by
Abundant Daylilies, H.C. 78, Box 187, Star City, Ark. 71667, (870)
628-4820, free price list.

   The Potato Beetle Wars
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! Colorado potato beetles are destroying my potato
plants. I've been trying to go the organic route, handpicking them
every day. It's not working. If I don't do something soon, I'm
afraid the plants will die.  &QL; 
A. Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to give the miserable creature its
proper name, is among the most difficult garden pests to control,
organically or otherwise. Don't panic. Potato plants can take a lot
of defoliation and still produce a decent crop. But do take action,
employing multiple strategies for best results.
</P>
<P>
   Start by applying a dose of the organic gardener's friend,
Bacillus thuringiensis var. san diego (or var. tenebrionis). It is
effective at killing small larvae, though only after they've
consumed some of it. This means spraying thoroughly (and
repeatedly) according to the directions that come with the stuff.
It also means you're still stuck with larger larvae and adults.
Those can be killed with rotenone, a comparatively mild botanical
poison permitted for use by organic gardeners. Neem extract
(Azadirachtin) is also on the organic list. Well-stocked garden
centers and farm supply stores will usually have these products.
</P>
<P>
   Handpicking is still very useful, if it includes crushing the
clusters of bright orange-yellow eggs that hide under the leaves.
It costs nothing, it doesn't pollute or kill any other creatures.
It keeps populations down and soothes gardeners, who if they have
potato beetles, also have frustrations and aggressions that need
release. Unfortunately, it's not perfect. No matter how thorough
you are, you always miss a few, and you don't have to miss many to
lose the war. A single female can have 10,000 decendants by the end
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage (for the beetles) of numbers like these is the
chance at resistant mutations. No matter which controls you use, a
few will be resistant, and those few will be multitudes ere long.
That's why it's important to attack on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to infestation, Colorado potato beetles can live a
full two years. But they won't stay around where there's nothing to
eat, so the final, or first, line of defense is late planting. If
they don't find any potato, eggplant or nicotiana leaves when they
emerge from the ground in spring , they'll leave. More will appear,
but if you can thwart that first wave, subsequent ones will be much
smaller.
</P>
<P>
