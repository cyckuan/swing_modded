<HEADLINE> Spiders Help Farmers Harvest More Grain in Hunan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Spiders once were considered
disgusting for their dangerous, ugly appearance. However, for
local paddy growers in the Dongting Lake area in central China,
spiders have become their best friends for killing pests.
</P>
<P>
Some paddy land has been idle to set up safety for spiders. "If
the spiders can pass the winter safely, the pests will not be a
threat to the crops," says a local farmer.
</P>
<P>
Chinese books written 2,000 years ago read, "All are happy when
spiders are flourishing." A spider eats five-to-six insect pests
every day, a local expert says.
</P>
<P>
The lake area is the first in China to study pest control with
spiders. Many local villages have benefited ecologically.
</P>
<P>
"The area used to be plagued by pests," recalls Liu Hui, a
local expert in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, "and chemicals
had been used as the only weapon to fight them."
</P>
<P>
The amount of chemicals used was drastically reduced after
spiders were introduced, which has resulted in better quality of
farm products, according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the natural technology has become
popular in the area and is expected to be adopted by farmers in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, local people want to gain something from their
invention. Xiangyin County plans to turn its vast spider-guarded
farmlands into a new destination for tourists, and a school for
outside farmers who are eager to learn the cost-effective natural
technology.
