 &HT;    FINCA IRLANDA, Mexico _ A humming bird is singing among lush
green coffee trees in this forgotten corner of paradise, while a
spectacular blue butterfly makes a quick pass through a group of
wild-orange trees and yellow orchids.
 &HT;    Welcome to Finca Irlanda, an organic coffee farm in the heart of
the Sierra Madre mountains in the Soconusco region of the southern
Mexican state of Chiapas. More than 30 years after Mexico exported
the world's first shipment of certified organic coffee from Finca
Irlanda, the organic movement is growing faster than any other in
global coffee markets.
 &HT;    What started as a pioneer movement by German immigrants to
Mexico in the 1920s has today become a worldwide phenomenon for
coffee farmers, who are desperately looking for better and more
stable prices in volatile markets.
 &HT;    With certified organic coffee trading at premiums of 30 percent
to 50 percent more than the price offered for futures contracts on
the common arabica beans, farmers are eager to join the movement.
Especially since farmers around the world, particularly in Latin
America, where some 65 percent to 70 percent of all the world's
coffee is grown, have, over the last few years, suffered a string
of difficulties. The culprit? Low prices, which in recent months
have dipped to less than US$1 per pound, with production costs of
up to 90 cents per pound.
 &HT;    ``This last season, we have been selling our coffee at prices of
$1.60 a pound or above, generally about 30 percent higher than the
market price,'' says Walter Peters, the son of Finca Irlanda's
founder and its current manager.
 &HT;    Soon after Peters' father bought the farm in 1928, the coffee
market _ along with all the others in the wake of the crash of '29
_ became very volaile. To avoid the price dips and the use of
hazardous chemicals, the elder Peters decided to start producing
naturally grown coffee. He sought out the era's only existing
certifier, Demeter Bund in Germany, so that he had independent
proof to justify his claims of natural production and higher
prices.
 &HT;    While other Mexican coffee farmers in the Soconusco area at
first were highly skeptical of the late Peters' growing techniques
and use of organic compost, they soon realized that in years of low
global prices, the production at Finca Irlanda remained
economically viable.
 &HT;    ``Everybody here in the region at first thought that Mr. Peters
had some rather strange ideas,'' says Tomas Edelman, owner of the
neighboring Finca Hamburgo. ``But then, after some years with very
low prices, they realized that his production was much more stable
in an economic perspective, because he had a sustainable price.''
 &HT;    Today, hundreds of coffee farmers _ large and small _ across
Mexico, Central America and the rest of the world are joining the
growing international trend of certified organic. ``Because of
Irlanda, you have tens of thousands of other farmers growing
organic coffee,'' says David Griswold, president of Sustainable
Harvest, a small U.S. importer of select beans for the U.S.
specialty market.
 &HT;    According to Griswold, organic coffee is the fastest-growing
segment in the United States. The total U.S. market of organic
product _ including coffee _ is worth $6 billion. ``Since the
beginning of the 1990s, you've seen really explosive growth of
organic coffee,'' he says.
 &HT;    A recent report from the London-based Association of Coffee
Producing Countries reports that, at 3 percent per year, organic
coffee consumption is growing almost twice as fast globally as that
of any other kind of coffee. Yet, it still accounts for just 1
percent of the some 20 million 132-pound bags of coffee consumed on
average every year in the United States, the world's largest
consuming nation of java.
 &HT;    As pioneers of natural production, Finca Irlanda is still light
years ahead in the movement now racing through the markets in the
United States, Europe and Japan.
 &HT;    There are plenty of critics of the organic movement, whose
members question whether these products really deserve higher
premiums at market and whether they are cultivated any different
than regular coffee beans. Those criticisms are quickly shot down
by coffee people such as Griswold.
 &HT;    ``Without inspections and certification, there would not be
premiums for growers, as people would simply relabel their coffee
as organic,' regardless of the origin,'' he says. ``Certification
is a necessary step to ensure consumers get what they are paying
for, which is a coffee grown without chemicals.''
 &HT;    According to a certificate from Demeter Association, which is
one of only a handful of large certification agencies, an organic
farm must prove ``no use of synthesized fertilizer, pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides or fumigants'' while using only ``organic,
naturally produced fertilizer.''
 &HT;    To ensure that producers are growing coffee without chemicals,
farms are visited and reevaluated every year. Standards must be
followed for 36 months before certification can be considered,
while soil tests are taken to trace any possible unauthorized use
of chemicals. Demeter also demands that a producer must operate ``a
balanced farm ecosystem [and] crop diversification, which provides
a favorable environment for animals and birds.''
 &HT;    A trip through Finca Irlanda is a mind-blowing experience, with
nature and coffee existing in total harmony with each other.
Oftentimes a visitor will be more interested in the colorful flora
and fauna in the tropical rain forest than the quick injection of
caffeine gained by a sip of the brew from the juicy red berries
once they're roasted. It is also quite an adventure. ``Watch out,''
Peters shouts to a small group of visitors, as he points to a
1.2-meter-long frog snake that slithers gracefully through the
grass ahead.
 &HT;    At Finca Irlanda, many studies conducted by universities and
biologists over the years have found an impressive number of
varieties of both animals and plant species at its 790 acres of
land. Only 667 acres are used to grow coffee, while the remaining
123 acres have been maintained as a 100 to 130-feet high tropical
rain forest. ``A team of researchers from the University of
Michigan in the United States found more than 80 species of ants in
just one area of the farm,'' Peters says.
 &HT;    Peters says other research teams have detected 87 species of
spiders, more than 50 different species of tropical trees and 63
butterflies in just one particular plot of the farm. And of the
more than 8,000 plant species existing in Chiapas, more than 500
can be found within the farm land of Irlanda, he adds.
 &HT;    Peters, himself a devoted ornithologist, also estimates that
there are more than 200 different tropical birds living within the
farm. Hundreds more come to visit every year during the winter
migration of thousands of birds from Canada and the U.S.
 &HT;    That the coffee is grown in harmony with nature shows in the
lower average yields of about 4,989 pounds per acre, versus 7,484
to 9,978 pounds per acre in an average non-organic coffee farm with
intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
 &HT;    The yield is also lower because tropical trees growing between
the coffee trees reduce the density of coffee trees per hectare.
Shade-grown techniques also limit the plant's direct exposure to
the sun while allowing for flora and fauna to live alongside.
 &HT;    The organic compost is the most important aspect of natural
growing, Peters explains. ``When the first investigators came to
the farm in 1964, we realized we had to enrich the compost instead
of only making it by the pulp left after processing the coffee,''
he says.
 &HT;    Finca Irlanda now has a production of more than 1,000 tons of
organic compost a year. Besides the pulp, the compost includes
cattle manure, weeds, sugar cane bagasse, dolomite and milled
granite, most of which are produced at the farm.
 &HT;    Peters says all farm diseases or other problems are treated with
``natural enemies.'' For example, the area's volcanic soil is
enriched with dolomite limestone to lower the natural high soil
acidity. Coffee rust, a fungus that attacks the leaves and
eventually causes the trees to die if left untreated, is limited by
severe pruning. And the coffee broca, a worm that eats the berry
from the inside out and can cause losses of up to 20 percent in an
infected tree, is treated with the natural fungus entomophagous
fungi, or beauvaria bassiana, which is developed in cooked rice at
the local agricultural research stations and sprayed once every
year on all trees in areas potentially infected.
 &HT;    While many believe the movement for naturally grown products is
just a passing fad, Peters feels that organic coffee will continue
to increase its market share among consumers worldwide. ``The trend
of ecologically friendly and sustainable grown coffee is here to
stay,'' he says. ``And there is room for growth, even if that
growth comes slowly.''
