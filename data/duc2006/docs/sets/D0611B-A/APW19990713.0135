<HEADLINE> New Weapon Against Cranberry Pests / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Who knew sex could be such a powerful weapon  
against hungry cranberry-eating pests? 
</P>
<P>
	A new pest-fighting weapon interferes with the moths' mating  
rituals, resulting in fewer of the dreaded Sparganothis fruitworm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moths are going to have to take lots of cold showers,'' said  
Jeffrey LaFleur, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry 
Growers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	With 14,400 acres of bogs, Massachusetts is the second-largest  
producer of cranberries in the nation, producing 1.8 million 
barrels a season. Wisconsin produces 2.5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The fruitworms can be devastating to a cranberry crop, infesting  
and destroying up to 50 percent of a bog in a bad year. They burrow 
into the fruit, munching their way from one to the next, rendering 
the cranberry useless as food or drink. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest antiworm device uses the insect's own pheromones,  
which control sexual desire, to lead the bug astray. 
</P>
<P>
	Moths mate around this time of year, producing eggs that turn  
into the worms that feast on cranberries between late summer and 
early autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists were able to replicate the pheromones released by the  
female moths to attract males for mating. The pheromones have been 
bottled in liquid form, for all practical reasons an insect 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
	The liquid is then mixed into a cranberry bog's irrigation  
system, sending the moths into a blind sexual tizzy. 
</P>
<P>
	The males smell the females, but because the scent is  
everywhere, they can't find the potential partners (unless, of 
course, they are fortunate enough to bump into one). 
</P>
<P>
	The result: fewer eggs are laid, and that translates into fewer  
of the berry-eating worms, said LaFleur, who sounds positively 
gleeful as he discusses the insect's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the pheromones leave off, the worms' predators -- such as  
wasps -- take over. LaFleur predicts the fruitworm could disappear 
from Massachusetts cranberry bogs over several years. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, a handful of growers are testing out the pheromone  
on several hundred acres of Massachusetts bogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The product is nontoxic to other species and to humans, said  
LaFleur, whose organization represents about 80 percent of the 
cranberry growers in the state. 
</P>

	HAYS, Kan. (AP) -- A smaller wheat crop in northwest Kansas,  
combined with dismal prices, means trouble for many farmers here 
who were hit hard by hail before the harvest began. 
</P>
<P>
	And even in southwest Kansas, where the harvest was more  
bountiful, many farmers are opting to sell at low prices rather 
than store their crops. 
</P>
<P>
	At Garden City, the Johnson Co-op is already full and piling  
grain on the ground -- with corn harvest expected in just 60 days. 
The elevator has been shipping grain for storage to terminals in 
Kansas City, said grain accountant Jerry Popejoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have already sold 25 percent of their grain at the  
Johnson Co-op, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scott Co-op in Scott City has also seen heavy selling, with  
farmers there selling 20 percent of their harvest rather than store 
it in hopes that prices will improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Strecker, general manager of the Scott Co-op, said  
farmers are selling so much because of loan deficiency payments. 
There are no incentives to hold the grain.
