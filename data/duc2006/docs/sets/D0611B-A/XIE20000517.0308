<HEADLINE> Anti-Pest Insects Sell Out in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has sold out of ladybugs
and other varieties of pest-eating insects, as residents of the
Chinese capital have opted for a cheap and environmentally-
friendly means of pest control.
</P>
<P>
The city's supply of several million ladybugs had been housed
by the Biological Prevention Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Science for use in scientific experiments. But they
went on sale when the prevalence of plant pests in the city in the
first four months of the year created public outcry, today's
Beijing Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, tens of thousands of insects kept by
the Chinese Academy of Forestry Science also became hot items in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Beijing's parks and work units are battling pests
with bugs. The Temple of Heaven Park, Beijing's first park to use
the pest-control insects, initiated the method in 1991. The park
has brought in a large quantity of insects to kill tree pests this
year and the results have been good, according to park officials.
</P>
<P>
A researcher with the biological prevention institute of the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science said his institute has
bred over a dozen species of insects for pest control in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
He said the anti-pest insects can also be applied to crops, and
for vegetable and fruit tree growth, and will help to improve the
quality of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Ladybugs are less expensive than pesticides, selling for a few
cents apiece.
