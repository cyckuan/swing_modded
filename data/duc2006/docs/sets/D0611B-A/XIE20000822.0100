<HEADLINE> Biodiversity Farming Helps China Combat Rice Blast, Up Yields (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40,000 ha of farmland was planted in this mixing pattern
in the prefectures of Honghe and Xishuangbanna in the province,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan plans to expand the acreage to 70,000 ha next year, and
nine provincial areas in China, the country's major rice-producing
areas, also plan to introduce the technique following satisfactory
experiments of their own, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian Development Bank, one of the sponsors of the
program, plans to introduce the technique to countries such as
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In their latest issues published on August 17 or August 18, the
weekly science magazines Nature and Science each published a paper
by Professor Zhu and his colleagues on the experiments.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State
University in Corvallis and a co-author of the paper, explained
that different types of rice blast attack different varieties of
rice.
</P>
<P>
In a monoculture field of rice, the blast can spread "like a
fire through a field of dry grass." The fungus has a harder time
finding a compatible host in a mixed environment.
</P>
<P>
In his commentary on the experiments published by Nature,
Martin Wolfe, a plant pathologist and research director of the Elm
Farm Research Center, an organic farming research center in
Britain, supports the approach.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the staple grain for about 3 billion people, mostly in
Asia, or half of the world's population.
