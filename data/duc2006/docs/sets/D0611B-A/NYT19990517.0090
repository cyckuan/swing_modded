FLEA BEETLES HARM VARIETY OF VEGGIES

<P>
   Q: Something is chewing small holes in the leaves of my
vegetables. I have looked closely to try to find an insect, and
something appears to hop away when I move the leaves. Any clue as
to what this is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flea beetles are minuscule insects _ adults are about 1/16
inch long and black or greenish-black _ that appear in spring and
leap among plants and chew numerous, small holes in leaves. They
hop like fleas, therefore their common name. If there are enough of
them, they can do considerable damage. Leaves may wilt and turn
brown, and the plant may die.
</P>
<P>
   There are several species of flea beetles that damage vegetables
and ornamentals. Among those that visit here are the tobacco flea
beetle, the potato flea beetle and the eggplant flea beetle, which
prefer nightshade-family plants such as eggplant and tomatoes. You
may find flea beetles in your arugula, broccoli and corn, as well.
</P>
<P>
   This pest is an accidental import, thought to have arrived in
North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
Adult flea beetles hibernate in the soil, then lay eggs in the soil
or around the base of a plant. In a week or so, larvae are feeding
on plant roots before pupating and emerging as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, flea beetles recently visited our garden,
peppering the leaves of two fuchsias with so many small holes that
they left mere outlines of the foliage. If you are an organic
gardener, you need quick hands to catch and squish these agile
pests, as they bound away with the slightest hint of your approach.
They can slip underneath a leaf before you bat an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied, and this, coupled with
their acrobatic ability, makes it tough to easily nab them with a
pesticide. The pesticide needs to make good contact with the
beetles, so you may be looking at more than one application. Some
of the chemicals commonly used around the garden target the pests.
So do products that contain neem, a botanical pesticide. Rotenone
and pyrethrum products can work, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to eliminating as many of the enemy as possible with
speedy fingers, the organic gardener has additional options: Use
row covers to keep the pests off spring vegetables; repel them with
garlic and hot pepper sprays; or capture them on white or yellow
sticky traps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you give me some advice on the care of my bearded iris?
I have four different beds with different varieties and differing
amounts of sunlight. All bloom poorly.
</P>
<P>
   What fertilizer should I use? When and how often? Do these
irises require an acid or alkaline soil? I water them regularly
from early spring to late summer. Then they get only rainwater
until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   When I separate them and give them to friends, these irises
bloom quite well.
</P>
<P>
   A: I am not sure which bearded iris you have, but I have found
the easiest to be the large-flowered, fragrant ``early purples,''
believed to be a form of ``Iris x germanica,'' or German irises.
``Iris x albicans,'' the cemetery whites, are another group of more
easily grown bearded iris.
</P>
<P>
   I have learned from growing these that they prefer to be planted
shallowly, demand good drainage and like sun. And, as you've found,
division encourages better flowering. This is often necessary every
three years.
</P>
<P>
   A well-prepared, raised bed of soil enriched with compost or
well-rotted manure is important, as well. These irises tolerate a
soil pH between 6 and 9, preferring a soil that is slightly
alkaline.
</P>
<P>
   I understand a low-nitrogen formula, such as a 6-10-6, is best,
as too much nitrogen can lead to rhizome rot. Apply such a
fertilizer in the fall and after flowering. An application of a
superphosphate in late February, before flowering, can be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   I also have found these bearded irises to be surprisingly
drought-tolerant once established. Give them adequate moisture, but
don't overdo it, especially if the soil is slow to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My magnolia is dropping leaves. What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Magnolias, although called ``evergreen,'' must drop old
leaves to make room for new. Those in our neighborhood are shedding
like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   By late winter, magnolia leaves, having been on the tree for a
growing season, often look weary. They may be scorched, and even
have fungal spots. Then, in late April and May, the tree drops
these leaves. If your tree is replacing these with fresh, healthy
leaves, don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Magnolias may also drop leaves at other times during the year.
Keep trees watered well. The roots are especially shallow, and
long, hot summers are tough. A layer of organic mulch beneath the
canopy is a good idea as it helps preserve soil moisture and keeps
soil temperature down. It also boosts the soil when it breaks down.
