   TECATE, Mexico _ Enrique Ceballos is showing two visitors
through the organic gardens at Rancho La Puerta, a spa here on the
Baja peninsula just across the border from California. As he talks,
he picks his supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the holes in the Swiss chard?'' he asked. ``People don't
normally buy it because of the holes. I prefer to eat the holes
than the chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he makes a little joke: ``If you are lucky, you get extra
protein from the bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are very few blemishes on the rows of chard and
lettuce, spinach and cabbage, even though chemicals are never
sprayed in this three-acre garden. Ceballos' work is guided by one
principle: ``In nature, all is in balance, and if you kill part of
that balance it damages the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He also applies that belief in cultivating the olive and fruit
trees at the resort, and in tending its beehives. In summer, 90
percent to 95 percent of the fruits and vegetables served to Rancho
La Puerta's 150 guests have been grown by Ceballos and his staff;
in the winter, the proportion drops to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, 44, a biologist from Tecate with a master's degree in
ecology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, intended
to be a wildlife manager. But 14 years ago he was persuaded to work
at the ranch by Sarah Livia Brightwood, the daughter of its
founders. She wanted to restore the organic garden her father had
planted 50 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about healthy living at the ranch, you should be
eating healthy food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The garden had lain fallow for 25 years, abandoned when a
nematode problem overwhelmed the crops. The worms were still there
when work began, but new strategies have been developed for dealing
with them. For example, a crop of a species of marigold that is a
nematode suppressor was planted. The marigolds did their job so
well that other crops could be planted near them. The area of
heaviest nematode infestation is now planted with fruit trees that
are resistant to them, and with herbs and flowers the pests aren't
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Being an organic farmer requires sensitivity, creativity and
observation to decide what is planted, and when, where and how; to
know such things as which weeds should be left and which pulled,
and what companion planting accomplishes. Following are some
lessons learned from a stroll in Ceballos' garden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flowers are essential in a vegetable garden because they
attract beneficial insects like praying mantises and ladybugs,
which eat aphids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basil and tomatoes are planted together because the herb
repels worms that love the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plants in the onion family, like chives or garlic, are planted
with broccoli and cabbage because the alliums discourage aphids
from feasting on the cruciferous vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plants are placed close to one another, to conserve water.
Cabbage is planted with lettuce, which matures first; after the
lettuce is picked the cabbage fills in the spaces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spinach that grows in the wild is transplanted to beds of
cultivated spinach; the wild spinach is more resistant to bugs and
gives the cultivated spinach more of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a form of crop rotation, celery is planted after tomatoes
because tomatoes take a lot of nitrogen from the soil and celery
needs very little.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weeds that are not too aggressive are allowed because their
roots help retain moisture in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos plans to make herbal teas from the new herb garden, and
soon there will be eggs from the organic chickens that have just
arrived. He also makes about 300 gallons of cold-pressed,
unfiltered olive oil from trees in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This farming is a low-tech activity,'' he said. ``It depends
so much on the senses, knowing the cycles of the moon, the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Many spa guests spend part of their stay weeding and planting.
``Some people who live in apartments never have had the opportunity
to feel soil,'' Ceballos said. ``They ask me about the trees
carrots grow on.''
