 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  In this time of eye-popping technology where
kitchen appliances talk to you and the electronic map in your car
chides you for being such a navigational nerd, it is almost
refreshing to hear an unbelievably low-tech way of grape farming.
<P>
   Almost, because the principles of biodynamics, a sort of
``beyond organics'' implies some far-out ideas and practices that
modern folks have long since dismissed as archaic and backward.
</P>
<P>
   Farming by the movement of the planets and the moon, burying a
steer horn packed with manure in the vineyard and spraying vines
with crystals, may sound like weird science but it swayed Jim
Fetzer. He's selling his 100 percent biodynamically-grown grapes to
Fox Creek Winery for the first commercial biodynamic wines.
</P>
<P>
   Fetzer, a member of the Mendocino Fetzer wine family, was once a
traditional California wine-grape grower leaning toward organics.
He now owns Ceago Vinegarden vineyard in Mendocino County, a
certified biodynamic vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Fetzer looked at the evidence of farming the biodynamic way and
how the program replenishes the earth, and was impressed. He found
soils that had become sterile from too many chemicals could be
brought back to health and produce high quality grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can smell the difference in the soil,'' Fetzer says.
``Pick up a handful of dirt from any vineyard and it doesn't have a
smell. The soil in my biodynamic vineyard is aromatic and rich,
with hints of anise and natural elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Although biodynamics is a complex system based on theories
developed in the 1920s by Austrian scientist and philosopher Rudolf
Steiner, many of the practical applications are simple. Biodynamics
does not use chemically synthesized fertilizers, pesticides,
fungicides, fumigants, hormones, antibiotics or growth regulators.
Crop fertility is centered around compost manures, green ground
covers and crop rotation. Weeds and pests are controlled by a
balanced farm ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook Winery is owned by Rutherford Benchmarks Group and
housed in the old Fetzer winery in Redwood Valley, Mendocino.
Winemaker Greg Graziano has taken the biodynamically-grown grapes
from Ceago Vinegarden and produced two exciting wines. While
organic wines in general have met with less than enthusiastic
reviews and sales, these biodynamic wines may turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook 1998 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Chardonnay ($29) is a
lovely wine with floral and green apple aromas, crisp acidity,
citrus accents and subtle oak notes. Some of the 1997 Fox Brook
Chardonnay may still be in the market; the wine benefits from the
extra year in bottle and is more complex with mineral notes.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook 1997 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Merlot ($39) is a
concentrated rich wine with deep black cherry and spice flavors,
excellent balance and a long finish. The wine is bright and packed
with flavor and balanced with nicely integrated tannins. If you've
been avoiding Merlot because it lacks personality, try this one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Green Business
</P>
<P>
   Organic grape growing and biodynamics represent a strong
commitment to pro-environment farming, but protecting the
environment goes beyond farming. Recently, the Sonoma County Board
of Supervisors awarded Green Business Certificates to Davis Bynum,
Benziger, Asti, Chateau Souverain, Kendall Jackson-Vinwood Cellars
and Trentadue for ecologically friendly business practices.

BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A Corking Good Year &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the myths that seems to circulate around the wine
industry every year or two is a shortage of high quality natural
cork for wine stoppers. Jochen Michalski, president of Cork Supply
USA, says not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winemakers can look forward to a stable supply of high quality
corks as a result of another good year for the cork harvest,'' he
says. The 1999 harvest from Portugal and Spain, the two main cork
suppliers, is slightly lower than last year's but both countries
have had outstanding cork harvests the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The string of good cork harvests also means that prices for wine
corks should not increase. Although the cork is a small part of the
overall cost of a bottle of wine, anything that helps to keep the
cost down is good news.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Riesling Reprieve &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For years, a growing number of wine writers and concerned wine
drinkers have come out against the use of foreign names and terms,
like Champagne and Chablis, on U.S. wines, and most have been
eliminated. One, however _ Johannisberg Riesling _ seems to have
more lives than Morris the cat. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms has issued a ruling allowing the use of the term
``Johannisberg Riesling'' on American wine labels for seven more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Johannisberg is a German place-name and, like Champagne, doesn't
belong on American wines. What's wrong with just plain old
``Riesling?''
