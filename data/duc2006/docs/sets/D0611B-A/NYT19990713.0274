   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ In the quest for great grapes, some growers
along the northern California coast, including the wine industry
leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old
peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow
horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this on a leap of faith. I don't even pretend to
understand all this stuff, but I'm committed because I've seen the
results in my vineyards,'' said Topolos, co-owner of Topolos at
Russian River Vineyards near Forestville. He said yields have
increased and grape quality has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in
the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic
agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as
farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that
doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest
control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the
ecology surrounding the vineyard. It works with nature and involves
astronomy and homeopathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the
chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came
with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,''
Topolos said. ``We can't continue to poison our way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and
question its impact on grape quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell
wine,'' said Dr. Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the
University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect
on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine.'' Biodynamics is
so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered
for further research at UC Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000
of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast.
The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and
Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a
fringe movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in
California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association. The
approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens
of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified
biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said. Nationwide, he said,
50 growers have earned biodynamic certification.
</P>
<P>
   Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born
philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with
a system of composting and special preparations that remains the
foundation of the biodynamic farming movement.
</P>
<P>
   Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen,
said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine
grapes will attain superior flavors _ flavors that reflect the
vineyard site, a term the French call terroir. Pesticides and
herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality
specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be
copied anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned
his vineyards from toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine
that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be
duplicated,'' Benziger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using
biodynamic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is
it going to make a better wine?'' asked Mike Gulyash, winegrower at
Glen Ellen's B.R. Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards
for its ultra-premium wines. ``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones
requirement to make a great wine.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape
growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture
encourages _ chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and routine
disking, which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines. The hardest
thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and
spraying when you see a problem,'' Benziger said.
</P>
<P>
   What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers
is biodynamics' strange practices, such as applying herbal potions
by the phases of the moon, spraying microscopic crystals and
burying cow dung in a female cow horn.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Willis, the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards,
said the buried horns, crystals and moon calendar that are part and
parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some
growers to embrace. He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes
and try something new. ``We can argue all day about putting a horn
in the ground, but we know it works,'' said Willis, owner of a
Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in biodynamics is growing, Beedy said. ``We are hearing
from people that organic farming didn't answer all the questions
they had. They had questions about the unseen quality of life and
how to work with the forces of nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan York, a biodynamics expert, manages the vineyards at Jim
Fetzer's Ceago Vinegarden. He is also advising the Benziger Family
Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three
years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years,
said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by
helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can
fend off insects and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces _
``some that we understand and some that we don't'' _ is key to its
success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with
manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice.
It's dug up in the spring. The manure ferments into a
sweet-smelling humus-like material _ Topolos calls it black magic _
that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget
almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   As both an organic and biodynamic farmer, Topolos said there is
some overlap between the two, but that there are real differences.
He said organic farming is more passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organic farming is not doing things,'' Topolos said.
``Biodynamics is quite the opposite. Not only do we do things, we
have to do them on a schedule based on a lunar calendar.''
