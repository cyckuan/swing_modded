 &HT;    Getting back to nature with organic gardening

   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ A growing trend among gardeners today is
organic gardening. Maybe you've thought about starting an organic
garden, but it seemed too overwhelming. It really isn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you can grow a conventional garden, you can grow an organic
one, said Dr. Mary Peet, a professor in the department of
horticultural sciences at N.C. State University.
</P>
<P>
   Organic gardeners don't use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
on plants. When you garden organically, you think of your plants as
part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and
includes the water supply, wildlife and even insects.
</P>
<P>
   Just like you would do if you were starting a conventional
garden, look around your yard for an area that receives 6 to 8
hours of direct sunlight daily. Prepare the site by loosening the
soil with a shovel. Add several inches of compost to it.
Vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers thrive best in raised beds,
which are built 4 to 6 inches above the ground, Peet said. Soil in
raised beds drains quickly so plants never sit in water.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting plants, choose ones that aren't prone to
diseases. Ask your neighborhood nursery and garden center for help
in selecting plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most organic gardeners go through a trial-and-error period,''
said Jeffery Hedgepeth, manager at The Green Thumb Nursery in Rocky
Mount. ``Gardeners usually have to experiment to find the best
crops or plants that work best with their soil conditions. We can
only help point you in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional gardeners control weeds with herbicides, but not
organic gardeners. They arm themselves with mulch. Decaying plant
wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from
the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal
organic matter for your garden soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reuse and recycle,'' Peet said. ``Don't put waste in the trash
when you can put it back in the ground. Live with nature, not
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   A layer of mulch blocks light from weeds and stops or slows
their growth. If weeds make their way to the surface, Peet says,
buy a good hoe and get to work. Conventional gardeners apply
pesticides to the garden to ward off threatening insects. Organic
gardeners don't use synthetic chemicals, but they can take other
steps to protect their garden from pests.
</P>
<P>
   Insects usually attack stressed or sick plants. The best
defenses against insect attack are preventative measures, Peet
said. Grow plants suited to the site and they'll be less stressed.
Don't let plants get too wet, too dry or too shaded.
</P>
<P>
   Many plant diseases are encouraged by constant moisture and too
little air circulating around plants, Peet said. To remedy that,
plan your garden with enough room to accommodate full-grown plants,
because water evaporates more slowly and air doesn't circulate well
among crowded plants.
</P>
<P>
   Organic gardeners work constantly to build nutrient-rich soil.
Peet describes the ideal soil as dark-colored, sweet smelling and
full of earthworms. Gardeners can achieve ideal soil by continually
adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to their soil.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in organically grown food is evident at grocery stores
everywhere. Consumers are reading labels and buying products that
were raised without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.
