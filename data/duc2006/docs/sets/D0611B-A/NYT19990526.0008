LADYBUGS SENT TO WAR TO FIGHT PARK TREE PESTS

   VALLEY VILLAGE, Calif. -- Shaken like salt from their paper
cartons, ladybugs tumbled into the trees Tuesday above suburban
Valley Village Park in the San Fernando Valley to do battle with a
menacing pest.
</P>
<P>
   Workers with the Los Angeles parks department carefully dropped
2 million ladybugs into the park's eucalyptus trees in hope the
red-shelled beetles will eat strange Australian plant lice
attacking the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials and entomologists don't know whether the plan
will work. The invading red gum lerp psyllid, which drains the
juice from eucalyptus trees, is a newcomer to America, and experts
don't yet know the best way to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Regan, chief arborist for the parks department, said
the ladybugs are worth a try. They already have been seen eating
psyllids in the park, and Regan would rather give them a shot at
beating back the infestation than immediately resort to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, we've lost nothing,'' said Regan, as
helmeted workers atop cherry pickers shook $1,700 worth of ladybugs
into the trees. ``We got to try using some kind of biological
control first.''
</P>
<P>
   If they gobble up the invaders, Regan will start dropping
ladybugs into more city recreation areas, probably starting with
heavily infested Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, just about everywhere you go, you'll find them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny psyllid first appeared in America last year and already
has spread through much of California. Los Angeles County
agriculture officials spotted three infested trees just across
Interstate 10 from their El Monte office in June. The pest showed
up in the Bay Area at virtually the same time and has now hit the
San Gabriel Valley and Orange County, said Rosser Garrison, an
entomologist for the Los Angeles County agricultural agency.
</P>
<P>
   The city's worst infestation is in a stand of 70-year-old
eucalyptus surrounding a picnic area in Valley Village Park. Young
psyllids have covered the trees' sickle-shape leaves with sticky
white cones, called lerps, that protect the insects as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   While entomologists say the psyllids by themselves probably
can't kill the trees, they can put them under stress so they are
more susceptible to attack by other insects.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of losing Valley Village Park's eucalyptus trees
worries those who live nearby. In late afternoons, the park is
filled with couples playing with their children and residents
walking their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely park, and people come here for the shade,'' said
Paul Goolnick, who has lived in the neighborhood 10 years. ``If the
trees died, that would ruin the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the ladybugs, which usually feast on
aphids, will eat enough of the psyllids to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nice to have, and they may eat some of the psyllids,
but I don't think you'll see a serious drop in the population,''
said Garrison. He said further studies must be done to find out
what insects attack the psyllids in their Australian home.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hazzard, president of the company that supplied the
ladybugs released Tuesday, said a gardening Web site lists the
specific breed of ladybugs he used as a predator of the invading
psyllids.
</P>
<P>
   Since ladybugs tend to fly during daylight, workers waited until
late afternoon to begin placing them in the trees. Shipped in
cartons that look like pint-size ice cream containers, the red bugs
had been stored in a refrigerator to simulate winter hibernation
and, Hazzard hoped, make them emerge ravenous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from November until now without anything to eat,
so now is the time,'' said Hazzard, of Organic Control, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials will monitor the bug war for the next 30 to 40
days, Regan said. If the psyllids persist, the department might use
a low-level pesticide that can be injected directly into the trees
without leaving a residue.
