auctions in search of bargains, profits and fun, law enforcement

his checks and sent him worthless cars. (Kevin Sullivan/Cox

War II, 120,000 Japanese-Americans were denied due process and
trucked off by federal agents after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,
solely because of their Japanese ancestry. Memories of the harsh
world of the interned Japanese-Americans of World War II will soon
have a focus in a memorial near the Capitol. (Justin Lane/New York

now-vanishing handyman. Nearly 57 percent of single women now own
their own homes, throwing cold dishwater on the accepted wisdom
that homes are the exclusive territory of couples with children.

``Bacchante,'' a marble statue sculpted in 1894 by Frederik William
MacMonnies, on display at the Brooklyn Museum near a sign
advertising the museum's controversial exhibit, ``Sensation.'' City
Hall's lawsuit against the museum over its showing of ``Sensation''
could evict the museum from the city-owned building. If that
strategy succeeds, it could have a remarkable result. The museum,
not the city, owns the artwork. So if the museum were evicted, it
could theoretically pack up all its artwork, the second largest
collection in the country, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
Manhattan, and take it them somewhere else. (Librado Romero/New

CRAVEN-FILMS, 10-20 -- Wes Craven has for a quarter century been
famously producing work less known for brains and normalcy than for
viscera and extremes. ``From the beginning, I had never really
intended to do horror,'' says Craven, whose new movie, ``Music of
the Heart,'' which opens Friday and stars Meryl Streep as a music
teacher in East Harlem, has heart and grit and genuine warmth.

Laurilla, owner of A Different Light bookstore in Chelsea.
``Initially, gay book stores were part of a political movement of
sorts,'' says Laurilla, who believes that his customers ``more than
the general public, have computers at home, which take time away
from reading, but when they want books they buy with quick-stop
shopping on the Internet.'' (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo)

a new comic-style story called ``The Seventh Portal,'' Lee's first
new series since assuming the publisher's seat at Marvel in 1972.
``The idea is that there are seven portals that lead to other
dimensions,'' Lee, 76, explains. ``Mongorr has conquered the other
six; the seventh leads to earth. It's up to these heroes to keep
him from finding it.'' (Kim Kulish/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT22) SAN DIEGO -- Oct. 20, 1999 -- CIR-GAMES-RACE, 10-20 --
Some characters in the Ready 2 Rumble boxing game were modeled on
people who worked on the game at Midway. As a result of a series of
rapid developments, both technological and sociological, minorities
are being represented in more and more computer games as fully
realized characters. But such characters are also raising sticky
issues in the real world about the nature of racial identity.
