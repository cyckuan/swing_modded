 &HT;    SOLARIZED SOIL REDUCES PLANT DISEASES
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH

   WASHINGTON _ When a critical farm chemical is banned by the
Environmental Protection Agency, vegetable farmers in South Georgia
and Florida may have a simple way to rid the soil of plant diseases
and weed seeds _ by cooking them.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service
Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Fla., have
demonstrated that sheets of clear plastic laid over the soil trap
enough solar heat to kill most of the harmful organisms.
</P>
<P>
   For years farmers have used methyl bromide to destroy weed seed,
plant diseases and nematodes, the microscopic worms responsible for
billions of dollars in crops losses, in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chemical is known to destroy ozone when it
evaporates from the soil and floats to the stratosphere. As a
result, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will
ban its use in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O. Chellemi, an ARS plant pathologist at the Ft. Pierce
laboratory, has shown that the plastic traps heat in the soil in a
greenhouse effect. Employed for at least six weeks during the
summer, the system can kill off weed seeds and diseases that would
otherwise wreck a winter crop, Chellemi said.
</P>
<P>
   The system has its limitations. For example, it cannot be used
for spring crops because the plastic must lie on the soil for at
least six weeks prior to planting, and in the winter before spring
crops are planted there is insufficient heat for the system to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Chellemi applied the treatment to four commercial farms
in Florida. On three of the farms, yields on solarized fields
ranged from 96 to 123 percent of those from methyl bromide-treated
fields. A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm, operated
by Vero Beach organic grower Kevin O'Dare, because O'Dare does not
use methyl bromide or any other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough for it,'' O'Dare says of the plastic
treatment, which Chellemi calls ``solarization.'' The weed purple
nutsedge was close to taking over the 10 acres of O'Dare's Osceola
Organic Farm when he turned to solarization.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, he said, ``our production was up 30 percent,
our labor was down 75 percent, and our profits were up 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The solar sheets are not a perfect replacement for methyl
bromide, notes University of Florida horticulture professor Steve
Olson, who has collaborated with Chellemi.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is not particularly effective against the
nematode that causes ``root knot,'' he said. These worms burrow
into plant roots, and intercept nutrients moving up to the plants
stems and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has worked with tomato growers Dale and Greg Murray of
Decatur County, Ga., on a solarization approach that also use small
amounts of approved chemical to destroy the nematodes.
