HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing solar summit here
this evening adopted a program on the development and utilization
of solar and other renewable energy sources in the 10 years to
come.
</P>
<P>
According to the "program on solar energy 1996-2005", 253
projects will be launched in various countries during the 10-year
period to demonstrate the technical feasibility, economic viability
and social and political acceptability of solar enrgy.
</P>
<P>
These projects are divided into five categories, namely, the
rural electrification program, the global education and training
program, the water desalination and purification program, the
information and communication program, as well as the industrial
policy, market penetration and technology transfer program.

<P>
Of these projects, some are identified as high-priority
national projects and the others are high-priority regional
projects and global projects of universal value.

The program says the World Solar Commission, which drew up the
program, will accomplish these projects through mobilizing a
concerted global effort with the continued cooperation and
commitment of various governments, international organizations,
bilateral and multilateral funding institutions, non-governmental
organizations, the private sector, research organizations and
universities.
</P>
<P>
These projets were all put forward by various governments at
the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization in the past three years and decided by the
World Solar Commission.

Chinese energy experts attending the summit said the program
on solar energy is the most important document in the development
and use of renewable energy sources in the next 10 years.

They said the energetic implementation of the program will greatly
increase the level of developing and using the renewable energy
sources and actively promote the preservation of the environment and
