LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A solar panel manufacturing
plant will be completed construction in six months in the capital

The paper quoted the company's director Vic Ranchhod as saying
in Lusaka Tuesday that the plant, which will cost one billion
Kwacha or 500,000 U.S. Dollars, will manufacture solar panels to
facilitate provision of solar power to the Zambians.

With an initial capital of 400 million Kwacha (about 200,000
dollars), the firm has already provided solar energy systems to
36 of its 120 customers who have made enquiries in the last 10
weeks.

Apart from power installations, the company will also sell
solar panels, inverters and batteries which have been imported
from South Africa, according to Ranchhod.
