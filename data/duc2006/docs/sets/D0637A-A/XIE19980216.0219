<HEADLINE> Tibet Gets Solar-Powered Streetlights In Its Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Streetlights that are powered by
solar energy have become a new feature in Lhasa, capital of Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, people on their way to pray will stop and
look with great interest at the lights by Dragon King Pool behind
the Potala Palace. A special piece of silicon half a meter square
at the top of a lightpole stores enough energy during the daytime
to provide electricity for 68 lights on the roads near the pool
all through the night.
</P>
<P>
The 820,000 yuan (98,700 US dollars) cost of the solar-energy
streetlights came from the Beijing municipal government. It is
estimated that the whole project will cost 15 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has an average of 3,100 to 3,400 hours of sunlight
annually in most areas because of its high elevation and thin air.
</P>
<P>
In order to make full use of the solar energy, the local
government has spent more than 17 million yuan on solar-energy
facilities to heat water, green houses, and solar-energy stoves.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy produces profits of about 80 million yuan each
year in Tibet.
