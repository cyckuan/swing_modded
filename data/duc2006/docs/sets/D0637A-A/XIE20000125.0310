BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- People in underdeveloped
regions of China will benefit from a project developed by the
Canada-based ATS corporation, which is aimed at promoting solar
energy technology for generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government will sponsor the project, said
visiting Canadian Minister of Natural Resources Ralph Goodale
today at a seminar dedicated to meeting China's future energy
demands.
</P>
<P>
The ATS, headquartered in Ontario, is developing special
technology for producing a solar-energy board capable of turning
solar energy into electricity. This technology is particularly
suitable for the regions that are presently without electricity.
</P>
<P>
Goodale is currently leading a large trade and investment
delegation to China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Such high-tech companies as ATS have great potential for
cooperating with China and creating economic and social benefits,"
he said.
