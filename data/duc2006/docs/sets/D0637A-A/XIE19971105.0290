<HEADLINE> Germany Wants to Be World No.1 Provider of Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany today announced its plan
to considerably expand its production capacity of solar cells and
modules in a bid to replace the United States as the world No.1
provider of solar technology.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed today by German Research Minister
Juergen Ruettgers and local governments of two western German
states, the German federal government would provide financial
support to set up a large solar cell factory in Gelsenkirchen in
the Ruhr industrial area.
</P>
<P>
Large capacity expansion is also planned at an existing solar
cell factory in the state of Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the new production capacities, Germany would
be able to cover about one third of world demand for solar
technology in the future, Ruettgers announced.
</P>
<P>
Under a study conducted by the German Shell company, solar
energy is likely to cover 40 to 50 percent of the world energy
demand in about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The current expensive production costs of solar energy are also
expected to be halved within five years through the application of
new technology and mass production of solar cells and modules.
