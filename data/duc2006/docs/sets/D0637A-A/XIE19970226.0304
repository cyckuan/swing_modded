YAOUNDE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The seminar on solar energy
and development opened in Yaounde today with emphasis on the
advantages of solar energy in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Participants mentioned that in most African countries, 70
percent of the population live in rural areas. However, the
living communities are small and isolated with no access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
But they need electricity for pumping water and increasing
production, one of the participants noted.
</P>
<P>
They cannot get it in the conventional way. But with solar
energy, they can have electricity at a very low cost,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy is an important social economic asset especially
in rural areas where electricity is still a rare commodity.
</P>
<P>
Forty participants from around the world attending the seminar
will identify national projects to be involved within the
framework of the world energy program aiming at developing solar
energy in rural zone.
