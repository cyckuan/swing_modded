<HEADLINE> Solar Energy Will Be Widely Used in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Solar energy will be utilized
in a wide range of areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
northwest China, with the adoption of the Sunshine Plan made by
the local government.
</P>
<P>
It will take three to five years to promote the use of solar
energy in both remote mountain and comparatively well-off
irrigated areas, and one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars)
has been earmarked for the first phase of the plan.
</P>
<P>
With 3,000 hours of sunshine a year, Ningxia is one of China's
regions ripe for the use of solar energy, and it has been
developing the use of this energy source since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
At present, thousands of solar powered appliances and dozens of
solar-heated houses are in use in many parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Apart from China's own expertise, Ningxia intends to learn from
Israel, Germany, Japan and other countries which have made great
achievements in the field of solar energy.
