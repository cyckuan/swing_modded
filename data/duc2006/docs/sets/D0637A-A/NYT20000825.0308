 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ A new day may be dawning for the millions of latin
Americans living without electricity, many of whom reside so far
from national grids that connecting these households is
prohibitively expensive for even the region's wealthiest countries.
 &HT;    Solar power, specifically photovoltaic (PV) electricity, has
been growing exponentially over the past decade, with global sales
now surpassing US$1 billion annually and Fortune 500 companies
pouring billions into research and development. Where are the sales
going? The biggest consumers in the developing world are Brazil and
Mexico.
 &HT;    Sunlight, or solar radiation, is transformed into power through
a semiconductor unit, or PV cell. The electricity output using this
method is expected to reach 1,900 megawatts by 2010, with the
United States, the largest producer of solar panels, accounting for
more than 30 percent of the global market. It exports some 70
percent of its production, worth an estimated $250 million in 1999
and an estimated $300 million in 2000. Mexico and Brazil each
individually buy solar panels worth roughly $10 million annually.
 &HT;    There's a good reason that Mexico and Brazil are such big buyers
of solar power. In Mexico, some 5 million people, or about 5
percent of the population, live in villages considered too remote
for grid extension; in Brazil some 20 million live off the grid.
 &HT;    That demand for alternative forms of energy is why solar
purveyors are beginning to focus their attention southward. Leading
solar technology manufacturer United Solar, for example, recently
announced plans to dramatically expand its Tijuana-based PV plant
to a 25-megawatt annual capacity with an eye on the Mexican market.
Belgium industrial powerhouse Bekaert is also getting in on the
action, spending $84 million to buy 60 percent of the plant.
 &HT;    ``To us, the production base is not a means to just having a
Mexican plant, we are very interested in being an important factor
in alternative energy in Mexico,'' says United Solar President and
Chief Executive Stanford Ovshinsky, who recently graced the pages
of Time magazine as one of its ``Heroes for the Planet.'' ``We
didn't go down there to be another border plant, but as a way to
take the first steps into Mexico as well as Central and South
America.''
 &HT;    But providing photovoltaic electricity in less-developed
countries is no easy task, and Mexico is no exception. Even small
systems are expensive to buy and install. And while the real price
is averaged over a 20-year expected lifespan, for most rural
dwellers a lack of upfront capital to meet high start-up costs and
a scarcity of credit represent tough market barriers.
 &HT;    General Motor's Ovonics unit donated 28 solar modules this past
May to the tiny hamlets of El Sabino, El Naranjo and Sicuandi,
which are tucked away in the Sierra Sur mountains in the southern
state of Oaxaca, but the local government still had to spend
$300,000 on installation and related expenses. It will eventually
pay more than $1 million to equip the communities with an
additional 85 modules.
 &HT;    Despite the costs, the Mexican government regards the
photovoltaic method as the best for providing power to remote
dwellers and has undertaken an aggressive rural solar program.
While about 50,000 small home systems have been installed _ 40,000
by the government _ another 250,000 are still needed by rural
dwellers, says Carlos Gonzalez Navarro, head of the department of
rural electrification for the government-run Federal Electricity
Commission.
 &HT;    That's just the beginning. Large systems are expected to meet
widespread use in the eco-tourism industry to power hotels and
other facilities in remote leisure and archeological sites. A
number of hotels and eco-destinations are already using solar power
along the Caribbean coast, including tourist resort Las Ranitas and
condo community Paraiso Tucan, both located on the Riviera Maya
south of Cancun.
 &HT;    While photovoltaic usage is growing in rural areas, it's still
too pricey to gain wide acceptance in town, according to Jorge M.
Huacuz, a solar market expert and researcher at Mexico's Institute
for Electricity Research. ``Most urban applications for solar are
still too expensive to compete with conventional sources,'' Huacuz
says.
 &HT;    That may change someday. Cost reduction has been dramatic in the
past two decades: a 10-fold drop since 1980 to current levels of
around $4 per watt for the panels. The U.S. National Renewable
Energy Laboratory predicts another 50 percent reduction in the
coming decade. In many remote areas, the solar equipment is already
competitively priced: a typical monthly loan repayment or lease for
a small system is currently comparable to average monthly outlays
made by developing-world families for other sources of power,
according to the World Bank, and solar power is safer, cleaner and
more reliable.
 &HT;    Remote water-pumping applications also represent an important
niche for PV solar systems. ``In Mexico, between 10,000 and 15,000
small family farms and ranches could be best served by PV-powered
water pumps,'' Huacuz says.
 &HT;    There are telecommunications applications as well. The Mexican
government, in partnership with Telefonos de Mexico, has installed
more than 12,000 solar-powered phone-repeating stations and
hundreds of emergency roadside call boxes. The government has plans
to deploy another 4,000 to 5,000 solar-powered emergency rural
phones, according to Jorge Silberstein, Mexico's deputy
communications minister. Remote wireless telecom relay stations
could also become significant users of solar systems: Cellular use
in Mexico jumped 128 percent to 7.6 million users last year and is
seen to be continuing its upward trajectory.
 &HT;    According to Huacuz, annual photovoltaic power growth in Mexico
should average 10 percent to 15 percent over the next three to five
years. To date, Mexico has about 11 megawatts of installed solar
capacity, a tiny fraction of the country's 35,000 megawatts of
total energy-generating capacity.
 &HT;    But the sun provides clean, renewable and decentralized power,
an attractive option for rural folk who have waited for years for
electricity to come to their areas. Technological advances, cost
reductions and growing environmental concerns are also beginning to
make it more attractive vis-a-vis other energy options overall.
With its large number of potential consumers, Mexico and the rest
of Latin America represent a bright growth area for solar
marketers.
