<HEADLINE> US Solar Industry in Export Boom </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Harnessing the sun and selling it
abroad, the u.s. solar industry is in export boom and u.s.-made
solar panels are becoming popular in developing countries.

<P>
New York Times Wednesday released a set of pictures which shows
a man from India in front of a solar-powered home, one of 50,000
to be converted; Tibetan herders using panels for electricity; and
in Somalia, a traveling medical clinic using solar energy to keep
vaccines cold in a refrigerator.

<P>
From India and Indonesia to Mexico and Brazil, solar panels
made in America are spouting on thousands of roof-tops, lighting
up jungles, deserts and other hard-to-wire areas of the developing
world that have never been connected to conventional power grids.
</P>
<P>
All this means big business for the companies that make solar
equipment in the United States. Statistics indicate that those
companies are taking in 300 million u.s. dollars, or 30 percent of
the worldwide market, making the United States the biggest center
of solar manufacturing in the world.

<P>
The u. s Energy Department predicts that global sales will jump
by 70 percent over the next five years.
