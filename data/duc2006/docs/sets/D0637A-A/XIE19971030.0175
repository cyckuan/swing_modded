<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt in Drive to Develop Wind, Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing trend in Egypt
to take full advantage of the blessing of abundant sunshine and
swift wind to diversify the country's energy source, said a top
energy official.
</P>
<P>
The development of the two energy resources will add to the
traditional and predominant power generation means through oil
and hydro resources in meeting an ever-increasing energy need,
which is growing at 12 to 14 percent yearly, said Minister of
Electricity and Energy Osman Abaza.
</P>
<P>
Telling foreign reporters at a press conference here Wednesday
evening, the minister expected the share of the solar and wind
energy in the total will increase to five percent by the year 2005
from the current one percent.
</P>
<P>
He boasted his country's perpetual brilliant sunshine and
powerful wind, saying the potential for exploration is vast.
</P>
<P>
Study showed good wind potential along the coasts of the
Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, South Sinai and the
Oweinat oasis area in the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
Investors, both public and private, are vying to inject money
in renewable energy, the minister said, pointing to a national map
to illustrate where giant windmills will be seen over the coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
Research on wind energy started in Egypt in the 1980s, followed
by the establishment of wind farms in such coastal cities as
Hurghada, Ras Ghareb and Zafarana, according to Abaza.
</P>
<P>
The biggest wind project aided by German-Danish expertise is
under construction in Zafarana, almost 200 kilometers south of
Cairo. It will turn out half of the country's non-traditionally
generated energy when it is completed at the start of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy, less exploited than the wind, is now used in the
newly developed areas along the Red Sea, the northern coast and
the areas where electricity is unavailable, he said.
</P>
<P>
But studies have found that the total annual solar radiation
ranges from 1,800-2,500 kilowatts hour (kwh) per square meter,
making Egypt one of the most suitable areas in the world for the
exploitation of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Egypt generated around 54.4 billion kwh of electricity
and consumed 45.6 billion kwh. By the year 2000, it is estimated,
Egypt will need 101 billion kwh annually.
