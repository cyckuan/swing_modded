<HEADLINE> Israel to Help Ningxia Develop Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Israeli
Energy Ministry have agreed to cooperate with the Environmental
Protection Bureau of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region to develop solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The first group of proposals includes forming a Sino-Israeli
center to expand the use of solar energy in the region, and
developing an energy-efficient solar water heater, which would be
especially suited to sunny north China.
</P>
<P>
With reserves of coal, oil and gas, Ningxia is one of the
country's major energy production centers. But the use of
chemical-petroleum has caused serious pollution in many parts of
the region, including the capital city of Yinchuan.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that a quick way to settle the problem is to
replace the chemical energy with solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The region has a large potential for solar energy, with 3,000
hours of sunshine a year and more than 140,000 calories of
radiation energy per sq cm.
</P>
<P>
All previous experiments on the use of solar energy have
failed, due to the lack of advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with Israel should lead to better results, regional
officials believe.
