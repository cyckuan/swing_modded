<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold 1st Solar Boat Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia will hold its first
international solar boat race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 boats powered by non-polluting energy will take
part in the race on Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, national
capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The entrants are from Australia, Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The race is part of the ongoing Australian Science Festival
which was launched by Federal Minister for Science and Technology
Peter McGauran Friday and will end Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Race adviser Hans Tholstrup said that the boat race is a most
exciting innovation in a world-wide search for renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the boats are solar powered, including a lightweight
boat specially designed for the race by a catamaran firm in
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
A trimaran developed by the Australian Maritime Services
Authority (AMSA) is powered by a 1500-watt engine run by 48 solar
panels.
</P>
<P>
A middle school from South Australia also presents its "Sunboat
II" which sleeps seven people and took 100 people over nine months
to build. The 11.2-meter-long boat set a world record recently by
sailing 2,500 km on River Murray.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with solar car, the boat has many advantages
including fewer building costs and speedier commercial returns,"
Tholstrup said.
</P>
<P>
He said that solar powered boats had a more immediate
commercial prospect than solar cars.
</P>
<P>
"Boats for recreation, fishing or even tourist boats may be
used as the sun takes them along for a quiet holiday on a lake,
river or dam. Even ocean travel is not excluded.
</P>
<P>
"The other great value of alternative energy boats is that they
are minimum pollution boats. Waterways restricted previously to
human use or to sail because of pollution may be opened up to
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
David Gray from AMSA said that the race provided his company
with an opportunity to take advantage of emerging technologies,
especially those that solve real world problems.
</P>
<P>
"We are specially mindful of the need to develop renewable
energy and power sources that effectively protect the marine
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia is leading the world in a number of areas of solar
energy research and application. The University of New South
Wales has developed the most efficient ultra-thin solar cell in
the world. The University of Sydney holds the record for the
best-performing high-tech material for solar thermal electricity.
