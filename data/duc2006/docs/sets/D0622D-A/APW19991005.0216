<HEADLINE> West Nile-Like Virus Found in N.J. </HEADLINE>

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Four dead crows found in New Jersey tested  
positive for the West Nile-like virus believed responsible for the 
deaths of at least five people in the New York City metropolitan 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The state health department said Monday this is the first time  
the virus has been identified in New Jersey. The crows were found 
in Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Union counties in the northern part 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to be transmitted by mosquitoes that bit  
infected birds. New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and 
Connecticut have been spraying pesticides to kill as many 
mosquitoes as possible before the first winter chills. Scientists 
are also concerned the virus will move south as birds migrate this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been five confirmed deaths and several dozen cases of  
infection in the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Health Commissioner Christine Grant said residents  
should take precautions against mosquito bites but should not be 
``unduly concerned'' by the test results. There have been no 
reports of New Jersey residents being infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to think that in fact we will see cases in  
New Jersey residents,'' Grant said. ``Diseases like this can have a 
hot spot, a fairly localized outbreak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Centers for Disease and Control Prevention have  
classified the ailment as a West Nile-like fever, a virus never 
before seen in the Western Hemisphere. It is called West 
Nile-''like'' because scientists have not yet identified it with 
certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials initially thought the virus was the more  
dangerous St. Louis encephalitis. Symptoms of both -- fever and 
headache -- are similar, but are generally milder with the West Nile 
virus. In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders 
and death.
