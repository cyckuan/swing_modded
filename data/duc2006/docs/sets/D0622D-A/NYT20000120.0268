 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Virus may catch Georgia, other states off guard

   ATLANTA _ Georgia and other states on the Atlantic and Gulf
Coasts may not be prepared for a resurgence of West Nile virus, the
imported illness that infected 61 and killed seven in the Northeast
last fall and may have spread south with migrating birds, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 17 states and the District of Columbia could be at risk if
the virus rebounds, the agency said in a report released Thursday.
The August outbreak in New York City marked the first time that
West Nile, which lives in birds but can pass to horses and humans
via mosquitoes, had ever been seen in this hemisphere; by the time
cold weather ended the mosquito season, the virus had spread from
Connecticut to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the CDC said the emergency effort to track and
identify the virus placed extraordinary demands on New York and
surrounding states, inhibiting other crucial work by their public
health systems. Before the virus surges again, the agency warned,
the other states at risk should be prepared to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Division of Public Health said Thursday that its
plans are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got several things in place already and we're putting
the finishing touches on a request for assistance to the CDC for
more funds,'' said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker, a medical epidemiologist
with DPH.
</P>
<P>
   Because the virus was not pinpointed until late September _ 20
days after it was misidentified as a different mosquito-borne virus
_ many questions about it are still unanswered. It isn't known, for
instance, how far infected birds traveled along migration pathways,
if New York-area birds carrying West Nile passed the virus to local
birds or whether the virus can persist over a winter season.
According to CDC research, the virus was found in 1999 in crows,
pigeons, and bald eagles; mallard ducks, sandhill cranes and
kingfishers; ring-billed, herring and laughing gulls; broad-winged,
Cooper's and red-tailed hawks, and kestrels; and robins, cuckoos
and blue jays.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report summarized 60 pages of guidelines developed
during a November summit meeting of disease experts convened by the
CDC. It warns that states are likely to be weak in:
</P>
<P>
   _ Surveillance of birds and mosquitoes, to see whether they are
carrying the virus, and reports by veterinarians and doctors of
unexplained neurologic problems in horses and humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laboratory ability to do several levels of blood testing and
virus identification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mosquito control and public education about avoiding mosquito
bites.
</P>
<P>
   _ And expertise on mosquito-borne diseases in state health
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has already identified and addressed some of those
needs, Lance-Parker said. The state health department employs three
scientists specializing in diseases that are passed to humans by
insects or other invertebrates such as snails. It has enlisted
three veterinary diagnostic labs, two in Athens and one in Tifton,
to gear up for required tests. And it has begun an inventory of
mosquito-control programs and resources, since wiping out mosquito
populations stops transmission of West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Lance-Parker said, only four Georgia counties have
long-term mosquito control programs.
</P>
<P>
   If the state's bid to CDC for additional funding is successful,
she added, DPH will also create training programs for district and
county health departments, which would be the first to receive
reports of unexplained diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to improve surveillance for many things: not just
(viruses of the West Nile type), but bioterrorism and pandemic
influenza,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance-Parker declined to specify how much the state will ask the
CDC to provide. The agency, which regularly passes federal
disease-fighting money along to the states, said last month that it
would distribute up to $2.5 million to states for fighting West
Nile.
