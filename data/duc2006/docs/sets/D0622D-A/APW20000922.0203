<HEADLINE> Third crow with West Nile virus found in Baltimore  </HEADLINE>

   BALTIMORE (AP) - A dead crow found in a downtown neighborhood
this week has tested positive for the West Nile virus, making it
the third bird found in two weeks in Maryland with the
mosquito-borne virus.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was found Sept. 18 in the Federal Hill section and
tested in a state lab, Mike Morrill, a spokesman for Gov. Parris
Glendening, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Agriculture planned to spray the
pesticide Permethrin Saturday evening in a 2-mile area around where
the bird was found, including in the Inner Harbor tourist area,
Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is targeting populations of the Culex mosquito,
which has tested positive for the virus in the past.
</P>
<P>
   State officials sprayed the same insecticide Friday at dusk in
sections of Howard and Baltimore counties, where two birds with
West Nile virus were found last week.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Maryland has been hospitalized with symptoms of the
virus, which can be passed to humans through mosquito bites. West
Nile virus can cause fatal encephalitis, usually among children,
the elderly or people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental group expressed concern Friday about the
anti-mosquito spraying, saying the risks of the pesticide outweigh
the threat of West Nile to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chance of humans becoming seriously ill from West Nile
virus is very small,'' the Maryland Pesticide Network said.
</P>
<P>
   The group said pesticides such as Permethrin have been linked to
brain cancer in children. It said several Connecticut communities
have opted not to spray for mosquitoes because of such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   However, state officials said the pesticide is harmless and
residents do not have to stay indoor during the spraying. Those who
still have concerns are advised to leave the spray area or remain
inside, Morrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two people have been tested for the West Nile virus this
year, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, one was suffering from encephalitis; 32 had aseptic,
or viral, meningitis; and others suffered from a variety of
diseases or conditions, said John Sweitzer, an epidemiologist with
the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   None tested positive for West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to encourage physicians to submit samples
for testing,'' Sweitzer said. ''And with this publicity, we think
we're going to get a lot more samples rolling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents finding dead or dying birds are asked to call the
Department of Natural Resources' toll-free hotline at
1-888-584-3110.
