   The bird virus that killed seven New Yorkers last year has now
spread all over the Americas, say U.S. researchers. They warn that
the Gulf coast of the United States will probably see the next
outbreak of West Nile virus. Despite the threat, U.S. authorities
have so far failed to provide the research funding to keep tabs on
the virus in wild birds. The scientists say that scrupulous
monitoring of bird populations is needed, otherwise it won't be
possible to identify and spray high-risk areas with insecticide to
kill the mosquitoes that transmit the virus to people.
</P>
<P>
   The infection is endemic to Africa, Asia and Europe, where it
resides harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according
to Bob McLean, head of the National Wildlife Health Center in
Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the
population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect
enough mosquitoes. In 1997, 527 people in Bucharest were ill with
West Nile virus, and 50 died. There is no specific treatment for
the infection.
</P>
<P>
   The virus may have reached New York last summer in a bird
imported from Israel. However, West Nile expert Zdanek Hubalek of
the Czech Academy of Sciences, suggests it may have originally
escaped from the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York, where in
the 1950s, a strain of the virus was given to 95 terminal cancer
patients as an experimental treatment. But there is evidence that
the New York outbreak last summer which killed thousands of crows,
and caused encephalitis in 61 New Yorkers, seven of whom died,
resulted from a different strain. But what is certain, McLean says,
is that as early as last summer the virus had already spread to an
alarming extent in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had already infected more than half the local geese and
sparrows. That's scary,'' McClean says.
</P>
<P>
   And the discovery of the virus in birds in New York, New Jersey
and Delaware last month has dashed hopes that it would not survive
the winter. John Rappole and his colleagues at the Smithsonian
Institution's zoo in Front Royal, Va., have calculated that the
virus would spread far and wide from New York if there were
susceptible migratory birds congregating on mosquito-infested
wetlands nearby. In this month's issue of Emerging Infectious
Diseases, they and Hubalek report that there are 77 migratory
species there, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, capable
of carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus is probably in every corner of North America by
now'' as well as parts of South America, says Rappole. Another
outbreak could occur anywhere there are enough infected birds,
possibly this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the next outbreak will be along the Gulf coast, where
northern migrants remain concentrated,'' Rappole says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential to capture and test healthy local birds to
know where West Nile poses a threat,'' McLean says. ``Then mosquito
spraying can be targeted to protect people.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean's proposals to screen birds in the coming months have not
yet been funded. Eastern and Gulf states plan to test dead birds
and ``sentinel'' chickens _ caged birds used as an early warning
system. But this is much less sensitive, McLean warns. Caged
chickens are less likely to encounter infected mosquitoes than
free-range birds.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Ostroff of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta told New Scientist: ``Extensive screening of
wild birds in hopes of finding the virus would not be
cost-effective.'' &QL;
