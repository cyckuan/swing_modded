<HEADLINE> State says bird found in Bergen carried West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State health officials Friday said a dead
crow found in River Edge, Bergen County tested positive for the
West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was one of 120 crows so far tested by state officials.
Results were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New Jersey test shows that the surveillance system we have
established to monitor West Nile virus is working as planned,''
Christine Grant, state commissioner of Health and Human Services,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every
county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant. The
virus has not been found in tests of mosquito pools in eight
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, health workers found traces of the virus in 74 crows
and two mosquito pools.
</P>
<P>
   No New Jersey resident was found to carry the virus, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St. Louis
encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in
Westchester and sickened more than 60. It was also blamed for
hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms. In the most
serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain. Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune
systems, are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Birds harbor the disease and many are susceptible to it, but
they cannot transmit it to humans.
