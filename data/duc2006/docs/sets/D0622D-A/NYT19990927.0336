THE DOCTOR'S WORLD: ENCEPHALITIS OUTBREAK TEACHES AN OLD LESSON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When you hear hoofbeats, don't think of zebras.
</P>
<P>
   To doctors, the axiom is a call to focus on common ailments and
not waste time on the exotic. But on those rare occasions when they
do detect a zebra, doctors say they need to take extra steps in
their investigation to make sure they have identified the right
one.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the encephalitis outbreak that is blamed for
at least three deaths in New York City. Earlier this month, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New
York City Health Department said the cause was the mosquito-borne
St. Louis virus, which had never been identified in New York City
before.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend the CDC, responding to findings from laboratory
tests performed by Dr. Tracey McNamara, a pathologist at the Bronx
Zoo, announced that the outbreak was caused by an even rarer zebra:
the West Nile virus from Africa. Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, of the Emerging
Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine,
confirmed the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses are closely related, causing virtually the same type
of inflammation of the brain. But the West Nile virus had never
before been detected in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDC would not have made the diagnosis of West Nile virus as
quickly without Dr. McNamara's persistent medical sleuthing,'' Dr.
Duane J. Gubler, the head of CDC's arbovirus field station in Fort
Collins, Colo., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The change in diagnosis, though not important in terms of the
spraying and other public health measures taken to combat the
outbreak, was scientifically embarrassing to the CDC, the premier
federal agency that is responsible for tracking infectious diseases
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, CDC and other health officials have led a
campaign against the threat of new and emerging infections, warning
doctors to expect more infectious disease ``zebras,'' like the
sudden appearance of old microbes in new areas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, health officials thought they had scored a coup when
they diagnosed the mysterious illness as the St. Louis virus. The
disease is usually found in the Southeastern states, and humans are
usually bystanders in such infections. Birds are the principal
reservoir for the arboviruses, but they do not become sick.
Instead, mosquitoes transmit the viruses to people who may become
ill.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the concurrent deaths of an unusual number of
birds in the city has turned out to be an important but
underestimated clue. Federal and local medical sleuths did not
immediately relate the bird die-off to the human outbreak because
West Nile, St. Louis and similar encephalitis viruses generally do
not kill birds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the CDC is retesting blood and spinal fluid from patients
who had symptoms of encephalitis and who did not show evidence of
St. Louis virus.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings mean that health workers need to investigate a
number of other possibilities, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the
West Nile virus has never been present in the United States,
because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in
earlier outbreaks and individual cases. In testing mosquitoes and
specimens from humans with encephalitis, CDC routinely checks all
types of viral encephalitis known to have caused infection in the
Western Hemisphere, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   There can be considerable overlap in findings from the
laboratory tests unless extra steps are taken to distinguish
between the many types of encephalitis-causing arboviruses. In a
sense they are all one virus, but with many variations that can be
detected in the laboratory. The encephalitis they cause is the same
disease, although there can be subtle differences in the type of
brain damage they produce.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses occur in different geographic areas, and by
scientific custom they are named for the area where they were
discovered. They include Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia,
Japanese encephalitis, and Rocio virus in Brazil and Argentina.
They are distinguished in the laboratory by small differences in
the proteins in the covering of the virus known as its envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't include West Nile, Japanese and other encephalitis
viruses because they have never been known to be here,'' Gubler
said, adding that in the New York outbreak, ``we had tunnel vision
on St. Louis virus, because all the clinical, epidemiological,
laboratory and geographic features pointed to St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson here,'' Gubler continued. ``We've got
to be more open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get past this crisis, we are going to have to go back
and check specimens from CDC and state health departments to see if
it has been here, and if so, for how long.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus was discovered in 1937 in Uganda. Since then
``it has rarely reared its head,'' Gubler said, though outbreaks
and occasional cases have been reported from Israel, France,
Romania and elsewhere in Europe. Presumably the virus was carried
northward by birds migrating from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly two-decade silence, West Nile virus caused a
large outbreak in Romania in 1996. This year West Nile virus
apparently caused illness among humans in Volgograd, Russia, though
Gubler said he had received no reply to an inquiry he has made to
Russian scientists about the outbreak. Lack of communication among
scientists thwarts efforts to learn why a virus is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   When birds began dying in and near the Bronx Zoo, McNamara, the
pathologist there, initially thought they might be due to viruses
that cause avian influenza, Newcastle disease, fowl cholera or
Eastern equine encephalitis, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara sent the specimens to the Department of Agriculture
Laboratory at Ames, Iowa, where scientists eliminated those
candidates as the cause. Because the Ames laboratory lacked the
material to test for the pertinent arboviruses, they forwarded the
specimens to CDC, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   Gubler said scientists also needed to investigate whether the
deaths of the birds indicated that West Nile virus had become more
virulent.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has been shown to stay in the blood of humans longer
than other types of encephalitis virus, so that mosquitoes are more
likely to pick up and transmit it to other humans. But whether such
transmissions occur on a regular basis is not known, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   A main focus will be to prevent a recurrence of the outbreak in
New York next summer. Scientists do not know whether the virus can
persist in infected mosquitoes while they hibernate over the
winter, Gubler said. In the absence of definitive information,
health officials will consider the need to begin control of storm
drains to decrease the probability of infected mosquitoes'
surviving the winter.
