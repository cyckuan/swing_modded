 &HT;    New York encephalitis virus may head south
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Migrating birds may have brought an
encephalitis-causing virus never before seen in the Western
Hemisphere to New York, where the virus has killed four people and
sickened at least 37 others.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are concerned birds carrying the virus may bring
it farther south as they migrate to warmer climates for the winter.
Georgia public health officials say they aren't worried because the
human outbreak has been confined to New York, and it's unclear
whether the virus would pose a threat to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to
the West Nile virus of Africa. Humans are infected through
mosquitoes that have fed from the blood of infected birds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its human victims, the virus has felled scores of
birds in New York and Connecticut _ mostly crows, but also a few
flamingos and an Asian pheasant at the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal animal host for a virus doesn't die from carrying it,
however. The ideal host remains alive so the virus can be passed on
to other species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have some more details about what the bird is and we
can look at migratory directions, all we can do is take the normal
precautions that anyone can do with encephalitis,'' said Tom
Bennett, an environmental health specialist with the Georgia
Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has
sent at least six researchers to New York. Researchers at the CDC's
labs in Fort Collins, Colo., identified the virus and are
conducting further studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be some time before we know how long this virus has
been around or where it came from,'' said agency spokesman Tom
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Since late August, more than three dozen people in New York City
and the neighboring counties of Westchester and Nassau have been
stricken with encephalitis caused by the West Nile-like virus.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are analyzing blood from another eight New Yorkers who
died since August to determine whether they were killed by the same
strain. About 170 cases of illness remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the CDC identified the culprit as St. Louis
encephalitis virus, the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis
in the United States. Late Friday, the agency changed its diagnosis
to West Nile-like virus.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate solution is the same in either case: Kill the
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that all the control measures in New
York and surrounding states are appropriate whether St. Louis or
West Nile-like virus is involved,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia doesn't have statewide mosquito control measures, but
many coastal counties do, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   No human or avian cases of encephalitis have been reported this
year in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, caused by anything
from head injury to bacterial or viral infections. Most people with
encephalitis suffer flu-like symptoms, including fever and
headaches. In some cases, the infection leads to paralysis,
seizures, coma and death. Young children, the elderly and those
with weak immune systems are at greatest risk.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda. West
Nile encephalitis has been reported in Africa, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile encephalitis cannot be passed from person to person,
or from birds to people; the virus must pass through a mosquito. No
vaccine exists for the virus, and treatment is limited to the
symptoms of the illness.
