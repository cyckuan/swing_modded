<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials identified two more birds
infected with the West Nile virus Friday, one day after they
announced that the sometimes-lethal virus had not been detected in
the state in almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead birds, a robin found in a residential
neighborhood in the city's Jamaica Plain section, confirms the
virus is being carried and spread by local mosquitoes, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Staten Island, N.Y. Friday, the first human West
Nile infection this year surfaced: a 78-year-old man who reported
to a New York hospital on July 22 complaining of dizziness and
fever. He was hospitalized for a week and is now at home
recovering, said New York health officals.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday the virus had only been detected here in crows,
which easily could have flown to Boston from New York, where the
virus is most heavily concentrated. But robins don't fly long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robins are local and the only way one could've gotten the
virus is by getting bit by an infected mosquito here,'' said state
Department of Public Health spokesperson Roseanne Pawelec. ``That
basically indicates the virus is present in mosquitoes in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the robin, another West Nile-infected crow found
in a residential Brookline neighborhood was identified Friday,
bringing the total number of diseased birds found in Massachusetts
to four. All but one were found in the area where Jamaica Plain
meets Brookline, not surprising, said state officals, given the
tree and pond-filled parks there.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday state officals told the public that a mass testing of
7,000 mosquitoes and 200 birds turned up no signs of the virus.
Although the newly discovered birds seem to contradict this
reassurance, state officials said they were consistent with earlier
state predictions that sporadic signs of the virus would surface
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here, and from now until the cold begins, we're going to
be concerned about people avoiding mosquito exposure,'' said Alfred
DeMaria, director of communicable diseases for the state Department
of Public Health. ``I'm sure we'll eventually find infected
mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the virus killed 7 elderly people in Queens, N.Y., and
sickened 60. New York officials responded to the report of the
first human case by announcing they would redouble their aggressive
mosquito-spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of West Nile virus typically experience flu-like
symptoms. In a small number of cases, the virus can cause fatal
brain swelling. The elderly, infants and those with weakened immune
systems are considered particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Health officals here issued now-familiar suggestions: wear long
clothes when outside, consider using mosquito repellent, avoid
parks around dusk and dawn, and empty containers with stagnant
water in them.
</P>
<P>
   The Culex pipiens mosquito, the type that carries the virus, is
currently in the midst of its annual population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, officals said they would spray pesticides in a
two-mile radius around where the two new birds were found. Spraying
will occur late at night. They will also continue to lay tiny
poison tablets in thousands of mosquito breeding grounds around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston prevention effort is dwarfed by the goings on in New
York. Friday night, entire area codes in the Bronx were sprayed
with pesticides, as were massive Central Park and parts of the chic
upper East and West Sides in Manhattan.
