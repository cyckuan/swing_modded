<HEADLINE> Report: West Nile should be ''wake up call'' to medical community  </HEADLINE>

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Citing a congressional report critical of
the handling of a mosquito virus, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman on
Monday called for an improved federal response to outbreaks of
infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which concludes an eight-month investigation by the
Democratic staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said last
summer's outbreak of the West Nile-like strain of encephalitis
exposed the nation's vulnerability to emerging infectious disease.
The outbreak should serve as a ''wake up call,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is serious and we ought to take it seriously,'' said
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking minority
member on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes a unified federal West Nile Virus response
plan, closer cooperation between experts in the fields of human and
animal health and an assessment of state's preparedness to deal
with the mosquito-borne disease. It also urges accelerated research
into a West Nile virus vaccine and a national web site to keep the
public and media informed.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the way the Centers for Disease Control
responded to the outbreak that resulted in the deaths of seven
people in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it faults the CDC for having ''tunnel vision''
after an initial diagnosis in humans blamed their illness on the
St. Louis version of the encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   Indicators, including a massive die-off of birds in the area,
should have alerted health officials that something else was going
on, the report says. But a diagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis
''colored CDC's thinking for several weeks,'' and delayed a correct
diagnosis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two diseases require the same prevention and control
measures, no harm was done, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ''CDC failed to expect the unexpected,'' the report states.
''West Nile provided the wake up call. The next outbreak of an
infectious disease, whether naturally occurring or deliberately
inflicted, may not be so forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement Monday, the CDC said the report
emphasizes the critical challenges the country faces regarding
emerging infectious diseases and said the recommendations in the
report can help clarify the importance of strong partnerships among
local, state and federal health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''As noted in the report, CDC has made significant progress in
addresing many of the recommendations. CDC takes seriously its
leadership role in preparing for emerging infectious disease
outbreaks and continues to work to keep Americans safe and
healthy,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that while the CDC and others were
investigating human illness, animal health experts were doing a
separate investigation into the deaths of birds and horses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cultural and communication divides between the worlds of
human disease and animal disease exacerbated the situation, a state
of affairs that must be righted,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   But the main emphasis of the report is on the improvement of the
public health infrastructure, and the establishment of disease
surveillance and reporting networks to better respond to any future
infectious disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That would include any bioterrorist attack, to which the report
says the West Nile outbreak shows the U.S. may be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is widespread agreement that the next emerging or
re-emerging disease that lands on our shores may be even more
challenging than West Nile has proved to be, especially if it can
readily be spread from person to person, as diseases like flu and
small pox are,'' the report concludes. ''When - not if - such an
event occurs, there will be little margin for error in identifying
and responding to the disease.''
