<HEADLINE> More than 320 crows test positive for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The number of dead birds that have tested
positive for the West Nile virus has nearly doubled in a week to
322 and expanded to a 10th county, state officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of birds testing positive for the mosquito-borne
virus jumped from 165 last Thursday and includes one bird found in
Mercer County, health officials said. All are crows except one, a
cockatiel.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties'
intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents
to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more
testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department
of Health and Senior Services. But McGowan said the numbers likely
mean the virus has reached new heights in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're really at the peak right now,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of affected crows in Essex County more than tripled,
from 10 to 39, the department said. Bergen County crows rose from
51 to 84, while the birds found in Union County more than doubled
from 14 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six birds were found in Hudson County, up from 18 last
week, 68 were in Middlesex County, 29 in Monmouth County, 27 in
Passaic, three in Morris County, one in Somerset and one in Mercer,
officials said.

<P>
   No humans in New Jersey have tested positive for the virus,
which killed seven people and sickened scores last year in New York
City. Three Staten Island residents have tested positive for the
virus this year. The virus is carried to birds by infected
mosquitoes. It is potentially life-threatening to the elderly and
those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Test results on 11 suspected cases of the virus in New Jersey
are still pending, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Four pools of mosquitoes collected in Bergen County in late July
have tested positive for the virus, but none of the 10,000
mosquitoes analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, sentinel
chickens or sparrows have tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob
Shinn said the increased numbers of birds will not prompt the state
to begin aerial spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ''If counties continue their effective control strategies, using
focused, intense, ground applications to further reduce the adult
mosquito population on an as-needed basis, we are unlikely to need
aerial spraying of urban areas,'' Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said they would return to northern New Jersey this
weekend to conduct a second round of tests on mosquitoes and
sparrows to track the progress of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives us a better handle on the way the virus behaves
naturally so that it helps us translate into what the human health
risk is,'' said Steve Ostroff, the federal West Nile coordinator
for the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   A third round of testing is planned before the mosquito season
officially ends before the first frost of the year, he said.
