<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Claims 1st Death  </HEADLINE>

   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become
the first person in the United States this year to die of the West
Nile virus, Gov. Christie Whitman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not immediately identify the man, who died on
Sept. 14, 11 days after he became ill. They said that he had other
ailments but that West Nile virus had been the principal cause of
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''People shouldn't panic,'' said Whitman, who urged residents to
wear insect repellent and long-sleeved clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people died and 55 others were infected in the
New York metropolitan area during the first known appearance of the
virus in the Western Hemisphere. The virus is typically transmitted
by mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 13 people have been infected in New York and four in
New Jersey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. New York reported its 13th case on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also has been detected in birds in Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and
Pennsylvania officials Wednesday said they had found the virus in
two dead crows outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and can be dangerous to
young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems.
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said it is increasingly unlikely that
there will be any more human cases this year since the cooler
weather reduces the number of mosquitoes.
