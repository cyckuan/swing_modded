 &HT;    Chickens first line of defense against West Nile virusBy M.A.J.

   HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The best defense against West Nile virus,
the Third World pathogen that has unexpectedly invaded the East
Coast, sits in a swampy corner of a county park in the heart of
North Carolina's apple country.
</P>
<P>
   And clucks.
</P>
<P>
   Five white chickens brood in an improvised battery cage perched
4 feet off the ground to protect them against predators. Every day,
Henderson County engineer Jerry Robinson feeds and waters thems and
collects their eggs. Every two weeks, he draws a tablespoon of
blood from a vein beneath one wing. Back at the county health
department, the blood is centrifuged and refrigerated, then shipped
to a lab in Raleigh to check whether the birds are infected.
</P>
<P>
   The African virus that in 12 months has killed seven people,
sickened 56 and killed thousands of wild birds from Massachusetts
to Maryland _ and for which there is no vaccine _ has not yet
turned up in Henderson County's chickens, nor in 57 other
``sentinel flocks'' across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But health officials in North Carolina _ and in Georgia and
other states that are watching North Carolina for the first signs
of virus in the South _ don't expect that to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile virus will probably reach North Carolina late this
year,'' said Dr. Nolan Newton of North Carolina's Department of
Environment and Natural Resources. ``If not, we will see it next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus is this summer's scary disease. Like hantavirus
in 1993, Ebola in 1995 and the Hong Kong avian influenza in 1997 _
and a new rodent-borne virus, announced Thursday, that appears to
have killed three women in California _ it is a reminder of how
easily pathogens that infect animals can leap across species and
take humans by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among public health experts, though, it is a reminder of a
second phenomenon as well: the frequency with which infectious
diseases that once were thought confined to the Third World are
menacing developed countries, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile virus shows us that new diseases can emerge at any
time, unexpectedly,'' said Dr. Peter Daszak of the University of
Georgia, a specialist in diseases of wildlife. ``It is a sign of
our globalized planet, with humans, animals and their products
being transported internationally at an unprecedented rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery last summer that West Nile had arrived in New York
City, coupled with confirmation this month that the virus is
circulating locally in at least four states, has triggered an
extraordinary national effort to track the microbe. Led by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the initiative has
enlisted health departments in 17 at-risk states, which are
collaborating to detect the disease as it migrates across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Humans acquire West Nile from mosquitoes, which transmit it from
birds. Some bird species, such as chickens, can be infected without
showing signs of illness: North Carolina's chicken flocks are the
above-ground equivalent of canaries in a coal mine.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts predict that West Nile will arrive in
Georgia in the bloodstream of migrating birds that were bitten
somewhere north of here by infected mosquitoes. When the birds land
to rest or feed, they could be bitten by local mosquitoes, which
would then transmit the virus to other birds and on to humans. So
many migrating birds cross the Southeast that a new CDC study
suggests southern Georgia could actually become a significant site
for the virus: The coastal plains of Georgia, northern Florida and
Alabama are winter habitat for some species that move through New
Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been two fatal cases of viral encephalitis,
transmitted by mosquitoes, in North Carolina this summer. And south
Florida, along with southern Texas, is consistently recording cases
of dengue, a mosquito-borne tropical disease.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tracking the spread of emerging diseases fear the
situation could get worse. Many insect-borne diseases are kept
under control by the arrival of cold temperatures, because most
mosquitoes don't survive through winter. But the planet is warming:
A study done by malaria experts at Maastricht University in the
Netherlands suggests that now-temperate parts of the planet,
including the eastern U.S., will become friendlier environments for
mosquitoes, and more vulnerable to the diseases they carry.
Georgia's risk of malaria, they predict, will rise 1.7 times by
2020. Despite alarm over West Nile and other unrecognized diseases,
public health experts stress that the potential for infection is
largely under individuals' control. Insect-borne diseases cannot
imperil humans unless the insects are given the chance to bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize, in public health, that people are often willing
to take risks, for instance smoking, that they themselves can
control, and unwilling to accept risks where they feel they don't
have any control, such as potentially being bitten by a mosquito,''
said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public
Health. ``So I try to encourage people to know that the diseases
are out there, that their chances of contracting them are small,
and that there are things they can do to lower the risk further.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put screens on their windows. They should cover
themselves when they go outside if they can, and use repellents if
that is not possible. And they should try to avoid being outside
for extended periods during the time when the disease-bearing
mosquitos are most likely to bite.''
