<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Found in R.I.  </HEADLINE>

   WARWICK, R.I. (AP) -- Environmental officials announced plans
Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers
found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the virus
was detected in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Four trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick
and Cranston starting Tuesday night at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials said they expected to find the
virus in Rhode Island because it already has been detected in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. It has also been found this year in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Rhode Island has been infected. Three New York City
residents contracted the illness this summer and have been
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which
transmit the virus through bites. Infection may result in
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area.
