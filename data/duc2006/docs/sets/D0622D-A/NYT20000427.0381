 &HT;    Encephalitis watch begins in Florida

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the season for encephalitis
approaches, Florida public health workers are setting up
surveillance for the mosquito-borne West Nile encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Health Department will begin drawing blood
biweekly from ``sentinel'' chickens on May 22 and ship it to a
state laboratory for testing, said Jack Petenbrink, who coordinates
the county program. Chickens are used to monitor the prevalence of
encephalitis viruses because the mosquitoes that spread them feed
on birds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will examine the blood for signs of the viruses that
cause St. Louis, Eastern Equine and West Nile encephalitis _ which
often cause headache and fatigue, and in rare cases, coma and
death. St. Louis encephalitis affects people. The Eastern Equine
variety usually sickens horses, but occasionally occurs in other
animals, such as emus, and people, Petenbrink said. West Nile virus
can affect people, horses and birds.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be the first season county health workers
routinely test chicken blood for West Nile virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the
United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases
of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York
area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might
spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York. In
October, an infected bird was found in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any indication it's reached Florida yet,''
Petenbrink said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus has killed crows, some sparrows and
predatory birds such as hawks and eagles.
</P>
<P>
   People get infected most commonly through mosquito bites. After
a mosquito bites a bird, the virus moves into the bug's salivary
glands, where it stays until the mosquito bites again.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the West Nile virus has had only one impact on the
county: The U.S. Equestrian Team is moving trials to pick the
Olympic dressage team from New Jersey to nearby Loxahatchee.
Organizers feared a repeat of last year, when the European Union
closed its borders to horses from the Northeast, where at least
nine infected horses died.
</P>
<P>
   Florida typically has very few cases of St. Louis encephalitis.
But cases can number in the hundreds during an outbreak. In 1990,
223 cases and 13 deaths were reported. A 1997 outbreak resulted in
nine cases with one death.
