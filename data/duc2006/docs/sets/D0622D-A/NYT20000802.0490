REPORTS OF WEST NILE ACCELERATING RAPIDLY
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive
for West Nile virus in New York state is accelerating rapidly,
state health officials reported on Wednesday, a finding that is
inspiring yet more pesticide spraying in New York City, on Long
Island and in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of July, the state had confirmed 67 infected birds
and 25 samples of mosquitoes that were carrying the virus. But in
just the last two days, those totals jumped to 115 birds and 38
samples of mosquitoes, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been reported so far this year as a result
of the mosquito-borne virus. Last year, seven people in the New
York region died and 55 became seriously ill from West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the virus had been confirmed in 15 birds as of
July 31, and in Connecticut, it was confirmed in one bird in
Stamford on Monday, as in mosquitoes there earlier. And in
Massachusetts, officials last week reported their first infected
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Within New York state, the reach of the virus has also grown in
the last week, with a report for the first time this year that
infected birds had been found far from New York City, in Ulster
County and in the village of Liverpool, near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense evidence of the virus continues to surface in
the New York City area, especially on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that health
officials had confirmed 15 additional infected birds, two in
Manhattan and 13 on Staten Island. This means that as of Wednesday,
the total number of infected birds found this year in New York City
had doubled to 32.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor announced said the the city would expand its pesticide
campaign. Given the finding of the infected bird in Central Park
and growing signs of resurgent mosquito populations there and in
Alley Pond Park in Queens, Giuliani also announced that the city
would respray the two parks, both of which were treated with
pesticides late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal L. Cohen said that city officials were working
intensely to try to ensure that any human cases were identified. To
date, the city has ruled out 160 possible cases while it awaits
test results from some 40 people with West Nile-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very actively looking,'' Dr. Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile-related pesticide spraying has also taken place, or is
scheduled, in Liverpool and in Suffolk County, on eastern Long
Island, where officials reported on Wednesday that the virus had
been confirmed in 13 samples of infected mosquitoes collected on
July 17 and in 12 additional birds.
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk, the infected mosquitoes appear to be concentrated in
Belmont Lake State Park in Babylon, which was sprayed with
pesticides the day after the infected mosquitoes were collected.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Bianchi, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society,
said he thought pesticide spraying had been excessive. The spraying
might present a risk to humans and wildlife, he said. City
officials have offered assurances that the treatments are safe.
