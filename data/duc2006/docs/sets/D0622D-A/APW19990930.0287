<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Virus Kills Five in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's quite a scientific expedition -- testing  
birds up and down the East Coast to track the encephalitis virus 
that has killed five people and infected 38 others in the New York 
City area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to look at all kinds of urban birds -- crows,  
pigeons, starlings and sparrows,'' said Andrew Spielman, an expert 
on mosquito-borne diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile strain of the virus has been found in dead crows  
in the New York area. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention is now collecting blood samples from city pigeons and 
also looking at ticks as possible carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Queens borough, where the first cases of  
encephalitis were reported last month, the CDC and the city's 
health department planned to take blood samples door-to-door, with 
300 households selected at random and on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to get a better understanding of the symptoms caused  
by West Nile virus, as well as possible risk factors for 
infection,'' said Ned Hayes, the CDC's medical epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the infection might spread with the fall bird migration,  
experts also are testing dead birds from Maryland to Florida. No 
sign of the virus has appeared in those birds, said Roger Nasci, a 
CDC entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to have been transmitted by mosquitoes  
that typically feed off birds. Six new cases were confirmed 
Wednesday, including a 79-year-old woman from the borough of Queens 
who died Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying  
pesticides to kill as many mosquitoes as possible before the first 
winter chills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said mosquito  
density has declined substantially, probably by 90 or 95 percent 
since the second citywide spraying a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The encephalitis cases found in New York originally were blamed  
on the St. Louis strain. But late last month, some dead crows were 
spotted near the Bronx Zoo. Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died and 
tested positive for the African strain, said zoo spokeswoman Linda 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western  
Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of the strain -- fever and headache -- are similar to  
those of the St. Louis strain but generally are milder. In rare 
cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death. The 
elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most 
vulnerable.
