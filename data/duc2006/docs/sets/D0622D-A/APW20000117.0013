<HEADLINE> Scientists plan pre-emptive strike on mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental
protection is reviewing a $2 million proposal to kill mosquitoes and combat West
Nile encephalitis.
<P>
	   Included in the plan is mosquito surveillance and the application of
larvacide in 20 towns along a 62-mile stretch from Greenwich to Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   The larvacides, which would be deposited in selected catch basins in each of
those cities and towns, would kill up to 90 percent of the mosquitoes before
they hatch and can transmit the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Several agencies as well as environmentalists believe the application of
larvacides presents the best way of quashing or containing the threat of West
Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   "Larvacides are not totally safe for the environment, but they are less
damaging to human and animal health. They are more specific than pesticides,"
Diane Lauricella, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's Fairfield County chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last fall's outbreak of West Nile encephalitis, state officials have
been concerned about preparing for the coming mosquito-biting season.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pre-emptive strike fails or additional communities discover bird
kills connected with West Nile, a contingency fund of $800,000 is built into the
proposal for larvaciding additional towns and for spraying adult mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Stamford officials are coming up with their own plan of action. Stamford
officials want to set up surveillance and prepare an arsenal of chemical agents
to ward off any public health threat from mosquitoes that bear the West Nile
encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's Department of Health and Social Services wants companies to
submit proposals for a comprehensive mosquito-control program that could be
enacted quickly if mosquito-borne illnesses appear to pose a threat to public
health this season, said Director of Public Safety, Health and Welfare John
Byrne.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Andreadis of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment station in New
Haven has been testing mosquitoes to see if they carry West Nile encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
	   So far none of the 178 insects he has collected were infected with West
Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   The insects collected are helping state scientists develop a profile of
where mosquitoes go to survive the winter. Experts say that information will
help them devise strategies for the anticipated return of West Nile virus in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in New York and at
least 59 others, who experienced high fevers and brain swelling, were stricken
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In Connecticut, there were no human cases of West Nile virus. But the
disease was linked to the die-off of hundreds of birds, primarily crows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now the question is what do you do about it to lower the risk and prevent
it from transmitting to people?" said Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Environmental Protection.
