NEW YORK PLANS MORE INSECTICIDE FOR STATEN ISLAND TO COMBAT WEST
NILE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Monday that the city
would re-spray all of Staten Island on Wednesday and Thursday with
the pesticide Anvil as a ``prudent measure'' against the mosquitoes
carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the number of dead birds found with the virus on
Staten Island _ 13 at last count _ prompted the additional
spraying. No dead birds with the virus have been found in
Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn, and three have been found in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner who made the
announcement with Giuliani, also said Monday that an increasing
number of mosquitoes found in traps in Staten Island was prompting
the city to act.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that the spraying, scheduled from 10 p.m. Wednesday
to 5 a.m. Thursday from trucks, was aimed at killing those
mosquitoes not reached by the ground-spraying of Staten Island on
July 19-20 and July 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a population of mosquitoes that have recently
fed who are not in the air on any given evening,'' Cohen said. He
estimated that the initial ground-spraying of Staten Island might
have missed 10 percent to 20 percent of the mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes feeding on birds infected with West Nile virus become
carriers of the virus, and may then infect animals the insects bite
subsequently, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the virus killed seven people and made 55 others ill
in the New York area. Infected birds indicate that the virus is
present.
</P>
<P>
   No human has been found with the virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, New York has sprayed pesticide throughout
Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn to kill
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, health officials in Stamford, Conn., announced that
they had found a dead crow infected with the West Nile virus, the
first infected bird found in that state. A Stamford health official
said that area residents had collected 200 dead birds for testing
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Jersey on Monday, tests showed that six more crows
found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the
one found in Union County, state health officials said, bringing
the total found infected so far this year in that state to 15
according to the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   All counties in New Jersey spray bodies of water to kill
mosquito larvae, and Sussex County has done limited ground spraying
for adult mosquitoes, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the
state department of environmental Protection.
