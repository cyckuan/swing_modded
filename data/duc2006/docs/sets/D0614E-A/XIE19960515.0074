<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Rules Out Quebec's Unilateral Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking
province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority
of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying that the laws of Canada must be respected, that
there won't be a unilateral declaration of independence and that
international law must also be respected," Chretien told the House
of Commons Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were among the most aggressive and explicit
Chretien has made on how the federal government intends to deal
with a third independence referendum in Quebec, according to
today's Globe and Mail newspaper. They also signal a tougher
approach toward Quebec separatists following their near-victory in
the most recent referendum on October 30, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the
separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the
legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is arguing that a referendum is a
"consultation", not the first legal step out of the
confederation. It also maintains that Canada's constitution would
have to be amended to allow Quebec to secede, which would require
the consent of all other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois,
lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the
democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is creating a climate of "confrontation" similar to
that of 1981 and 1982, when the constitution was amended against
Quebec's wishes, Gauthier warned.
