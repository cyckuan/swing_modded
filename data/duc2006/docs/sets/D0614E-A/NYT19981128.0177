   LONGUEUIL, Quebec _ Chanted slogans flowed, cheers rose,
fleur-de-lis flags flapped everywhere. Although the gathering was
just another campaign rally as Quebec roars toward tomorrow's
election showdown between separatists and federalists, it seemed
more like old home day for the secessionist cause.
</P>
<P>
   Video screens played and replayed images of the triumphs of the
Parti Quebecois, which in the three decades since its founding by
the late Rene Levesque has grown from a fringe movement to Quebec's
most powerful political party.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque's widow was on hand. So was a living legend,
poet-songwriter Gilles Vigneault _ the Woody Guthrie of Quebec
nationalism _ whose daughter, Jessica, gave quavering voice to a
song with the refrain, ``Tomorrow belongs to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd roared back, ``We want a country!''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all was Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's
59-year-old premier. He is a passionate articulator of the
separatist vision, and the bete noire of English Canada, vowing
that the province that already considers itself a nation in spirit
will soon become a nation in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps very soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a people, and a people has the right to be a country,''
he said. ``Give me the mandate so that, finally, we can say `Yes'
to ourselves once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go
to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the
separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
Going head-to-head in the race are Bouchard and the Liberal Party
challenger, Jean Charest, 40, the only federalist champion given
any chance of unseating the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But to the shock of Canadians, who only a few weeks ago were
gleefully predicting a rout of the secessionist government in
Quebec City, Charest has failed to catch fire with voters. The
waning hours of the campaign are looking more like a cakewalk for
the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80
percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about
two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or
some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Should the separatists win, as the latest polls suggest,
Canada's future as an intact nation will be cast into doubt as
Bouchard presses Quebec toward what he calls its ``natural
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quebec is notorious for last-minute shifts in the
political wind. If the federalists somehow snatch victory against
all odds, Bouchard will almost certainly resign from politics. With
no other separatist leader in sight capable of matching his
popularity, the dream of Quebec independence would be smashed,
perhaps forever. That is an outcome that the rest of Canada
fervently desires.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed a dead heat only a few months ago when Charest,
cast as a white knight riding to the rescue of embattled
federalism, yielded to an unprecedented draft movement, quitting a
safe seat in national Parliament to return to his native Quebec to
do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Poll after poll found Charest to be the only politician capable
of beating Bouchard. The timing seemed perfect. For the same polls
also showed Quebecers wearying of the ``neverendum referendum,'' as
Montreal humorist Josh Freed has dubbed the seemingly endless quest
for nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Charest hammered the theme of Quebec uselessly
dissipating its energies on an impossible scheme. He rhetorically
asked audiences the question that seems to mystify everyone except
Quebecers: Why should this bountiful province seek to quit one of
the world's most prosperous, successful democracies?
</P>
<P>
   ``How long must Quebecers keep pulling this ball and chain?'' he
said last week as the 33-day official campaign season ticked down
toward a ballot box reckoning. ``We must end a political debate
that perpetuates uncertainty, which will be paid for by our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quebecers, or at least French Quebecers, responded with a
yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Charest's charisma and eloquence, the federalist crusade
has fizzled _ in large part because the native son, upon returning
home, strikes many Quebecers as a stranger. Or, worse, just a front
man for English Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cheering from the rest of Canada when Mr. Charest went
to Quebec did him no good in the province,'' observed Jeffrey
Simpson, national affairs columnist for the Globe and Mail, a
nationally circulated newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bouchard won points simply by mocking Charest's notion
of Quebec comfortably cradled in the arms of Canada: ``Jean Charest
is a man who denies Quebec as it is, in its profound identity. ...
Quebec will never resign itself to being a province like the
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest made a dangerous decision by portraying himself as a
political outsider in a province that fears the outside above all
else. The entire history of Quebec might be told as a desperate
struggle for the survival of its unique, French-rooted culture
against English North America.
</P>
<P>
   After years in Ottawa, preoccupied with national politics,
Charest seems to have forgotten that even Quebecers opposed to
secession don't carry much love for Canada in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I am not truly a separatist, but I will vote Parti
Quebecois because I trust Mr. Bouchard to look after the interests
of Quebec first and foremost,'' said Marc Trudel, 43, a Quebec City
schoolteacher. ``Mr. Charest seems too comfortable with Canada. We
can never trust the English provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show that Quebecers are sick of referendums
on independence. And to the rest of Canada, and Charest's
supporters in Quebec, secession is such a soul-searing issue that
it was assumed that weariness with referendums must necessarily
translate into a big vote for the federalists.
</P>
<P>
   But to French Quebecers, separatism is one issue among many.
Even those who think secession is a bad idea will support the Parti
Quebecois if the party seems to serve the greater good of the
province. And the fact is, Bouchard has done a topnotch job of
running Quebec _ unemployment is down, exports to the United States
are up, government spending has been curtailed, and Montreal is
rocketing back as one of the most dynamic cities in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, people feel better economically,'' said
Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Leger &AMP; Leger.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys released last week show that Quebecers believe Bouchard
is honest, dedicated, hard-working, and, perhaps above all, the one
politician capable of forcing Canada to show respect for its most
willful and wayward province.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charest's federalist campaign was undercut from the
start by comments from Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who
told a Quebec newspaper, La Presse, that Canada would not seek
changes in federal law to give Quebec special political powers and
protections. A new constitutional formula is widely considered the
only way to keep Quebec from bolting the 131-year-old Canadian
confederation.
</P>
<P>
   Charest is likely to score an impressive victory in Montreal,
with its cosmopolitan population of English Quebecers, Jews, and
ethnic voters _ such as Chinese and East Indians _ who loathe the
French language laws of the separatist government nearly as much as
they despise the secessionist impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bouchard is sure to win big in the separatist
heartland north of Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   The real battle for Quebec is being fought in the St. Lawrence
River valley between Montreal and the provincial capital, in faded
centers such as Trois Rivieres, Longueuil, and Cap-de-la-Madeline.
</P>
<P>
   And on this vital front, things look bleak for Charest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not about separation but standing tall against
Canada,'' said Valerie Corbeil, a 34-year-old beautician in gritty
Trois-Rivieres. ``Mr. Charest seems a nice man. But I fear he would
let Quebecers become like Cajuns in Louisiana _ colorful characters
with bad French and no power.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressive separatist win would make it a near certainty that
Bouchard will launch another referendum on independence, possibly
as early as next year. He has pledged to put the issue before
Quebecers again only in the event of ``winning conditions,'' by
which he apparently means a Quebec that is economically sound
enough to weather breaking away from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being closely followed not only in Ottawa but
Washington, Paris, London, and other capitals, although many
Americans seem generally oblivious to the political drama unfurling
north of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans tend to think the absence of bombs and bullets means
no crisis,'' said one Canada-based foreign diplomat. ``But Canada
is drifting toward a very serious situation. The federal government
has basically lost ability to influence events in Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a landmark Canadian Supreme Court case
that backfired badly on the federal government, the nation's nine
high judges ruled that Canada cannot prevent the secession of
Quebec if a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers opt for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won so many battles,'' Bouchard told a cheering
audience last week. ``We have only one more to win. Let's win it
and give to our children a Quebec that is fully responsible for its
own destiny.''
