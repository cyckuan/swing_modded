<HEADLINE> Canada's Supreme Court Begins Hearings on Quebec Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada
began a landmark hearing Monday on whether the French-speaking
province of Quebec has the right to secede unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The week-long hearing is expected to let the court rule, months
from now, on whether unilateral secession is legal under either
domestic or international law, and if the two conflicts, which law
prevails.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government initiated the court case 18 months
ago in a bid to lay down legal rules for the political battle over
Quebec separation.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a key part of Ottawa's strategy of
challenging separatists arguments that Quebec has a right to
separate regardless of the views of the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government is officially boycotting the case, saying
that separation is a political issue rather than a legal issue and
that the court should not hear the case.
</P>
<P>
Premier Jean Chretien's government is using a biased court to
try to rob Quebecers of their democratic right to determine their
own future, it argued.
</P>
<P>
"The last word belongs not to one man, not to one government,
not to one text imposed from on high.... The last word belongs to
Quebec democracy, to the Quebec people," declared Quebec Premier
Lucien Bouchard.
