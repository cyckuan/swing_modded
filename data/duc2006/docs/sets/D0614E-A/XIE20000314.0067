<HEADLINE> Canadian MPs Vote on Clarity Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian House of Commons
Monday began voting on a bill aimed at making separation attempts
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Members of the parliament are expected to spend about 30
straight hours in the process of voting 411 amendments to the
draft legislation, which was tabled last December by the ruling
Liberal government.
</P>
<P>
The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to the
bill, has proposed 403 amendments while the other three opposition
parties added eight more to stall the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The roll-call voting will last until Wednesday morning as every
MP rises in turn for a total of 411 times to signify their vote.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Clarity Bill, the Liberal government's Bill C-20
enshrines into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision that found Quebec
must win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it
can separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clear question and a clear majority," said Prime
Minister Jean Chretien last December.
</P>
<P>
The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from
Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City
reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it
sees fit.
