	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at rowdy young people
Wednesday after being pelted with rocks and bottles, the second
year in a row force was needed to disperse unruly crowds on
Quebec's provincial holiday.
	   Police said 35 people were arrested, many for minor incidents,
during a concert and other celebrations to mark Quebec's Fete
Nationale, which has been marred over the years by riots and other
violent incidents.
	   Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early
Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year,
when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars
of damage.
	   The holiday is celebrated mainly by Quebec's French-speaking
nationalists _ those who support either outright independence from
Canada or some form of increased autonomy.
	   During Wednesday's holiday parade in Montreal, the hard-line
leader of a lobby group for the English-speaking minority was
pelted with beer, water and a pie as he marched with colleagues at
the tail end of the procession despite objections from parade
organizers.
	   The heckling became so bad that police intervened, hustling
Alliance Quebec leader William Johnson into a paddy wagon and
driving him away.
	   ``We had to stop his walk for his own safety,'' said Jean-Bruno
Latour, a Montreal police spokesman.
