<HEADLINE> Quebecers Are Facing Reality, Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said people in the French-speaking province of Quebec are
facing reality about the consequences of separation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by provincial premiers to solve the unity crisis and
his own government's work have opened up communication between
Quebec and the rest of Canada, providing a reality check for
Quebecers, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"This road to heaven just by voting independent has to be put
in a realistic context, and it's what we've been able to do for
the last two months," he was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
The premiers' unity initiative in Calgary and the "war of
words" between the federal and Quebec government have helped
clarify the issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Before, they (separatists in Quebec) were selling a dream, and
now I guess that they have to look at the reality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several
decades. People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of
separation in the October referendum two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold
another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial
election, which is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he
promises another referendum in the next election because "people
in Quebec don't want any referendum," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"They're fed up. They don't want us to discuss that any more.
He (Bouchard) is dividing the families, creating economic
uncertainty," Chretien added.
