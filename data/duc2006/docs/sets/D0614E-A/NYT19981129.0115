   QUEBEC _ A Quebecer returning home this week after a few years'
absence would be thoroughly confused by the campaign posters lining
the highways leading to this provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that prominently feature the blue and white fleur-de-lis
flag, the provocative symbol of the Quebec separatist movement,
this time belong to the anti-separation Liberal Party and its
leader, Jean Charest.
</P>
<P>
   And neither a fleur-de-lis nor the color blue is on any of the
posters for the separatist Parti Quebecois, and the current premier
of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard. Instead, the primary color used is a
muddy green, which is supposed to stand for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois hope that when the
vote takes place Monday in all 125 ridings, or districts, around
the province, Quebecers will be able to clearly distinguish between
the two parties and their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the reversal of symbols on the campaign posters is just one
of many reversals in a campaign that has distracted voters,
confounded experts and added a thick layer of ambiguity to one of
the continent's most baffling political landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign itself has lasted only 33 days _ the shortest ever
in Quebec _ but in that time Charest and the Liberals have steadily
lost support.
</P>
<P>
   Charest, the former leader of the federal Conservative Party,
arrived in Quebec this year as the great federalist hope whom the
rest of Canada had recruited to banish the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But he seems to have gone from hero to goat, with the latest
polls showing the Liberals headed for a stinging defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has failed to become the leading contender for Quebec's
champion against Ottawa,'' said Desmond Morton, director of the
Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University in Montreal.
During the campaign, Bouchard attacked Charest relentlessly and
raised doubts about how well he really knew Quebec, since Charest
had been away from the province for so long, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Charest ``often looked hot-tempered and crotchety against the
man many Quebecers see as a secular saint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who was practically canonized here after losing a leg
to flesh-eating disease in 1994, did not run an unassailable
campaign. In the last four years that his Parti Quebecois has
controlled the provincial assembly, it has tried to balance the
provincial budget by closing hospitals and making deep cuts in
hallowed social spending programs like education. Those cuts have
angered many, presenting the Liberals with ample targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bouchard had trouble almost every day of the campaign,''
Morton said. ``But he was always able to capitalize on his ability
to get out his message through a largely sympathetic media.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it dealt with the fundamental issue of separation,
that message was not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard had at first vowed that if he was re-elected, he would
hold another referendum. In the last referendum, in 1995, the
separatist question was narrowly defeated, but Quebec law prohibits
a government from holding more than one referendum during a term
that usually lasts four to five years.
</P>
<P>
   As surveys showed that Quebecers _ for whom Monday's election is
the sixth in six years _ were overwhelmingly against holding
another referendum, Bouchard's position wavered. He promised a
referendum only when ``winning conditions'' prevailed, but never
defined those terms. Later in the campaign, he said he would
negotiate a new arrangement on social spending with Ottawa, a
``renewed federalism'' that seemed the polar opposite of previous
separation threats.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters were confused, others angry. ``Ambiguity wins in
Quebec,'' a Montreal radio talk show host, Gord Logan, proclaimed
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Charest left no doubt that he was against a referendum. Using
the fleur-de-lis on campaign posters was his way of taking back the
powerful image from the separatists. But in the end, Charest's
straightforwardness may have cost him support even among people who
said they would vote against separation.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years of the separatist movement, many Quebecers have
developed sophisticated positions on independence that at times can
puzzle outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Balthazar, a professor of political science at Laval
University, said many Quebec voters hedged their bets. They do not
necessarily want to separate from Canada, but they expect their
leaders to use the threat of separation as leverage to bargain with
the federal government for more provincial powers.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Balthazar continued, even Quebecers who want to stay in
Canada will vote for the Parti Quebecois, which officially embraces
separation, to maintain this perceived advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Bouchard could not necessarily count the support he wins
on Monday as support for a referendum. ``Right now, a PQ victory
would not translate into a future winning referendum,'' Balthazar
said. He said he believed that Quebecers would vote for Bouchard
because of the way he has managed Quebec, not because he will make
it an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Leger, president of Le Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger, a
Montreal polling company, said that if the Parti Quebecois picks up
more seats in the provincial assembly than the 77 it now controls,
and exceeds 50 percent of the popular vote, it will be encouraged
to call for a referendum in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that voters now see Bouchard's separatist
government as standing for stability while it is Charest's Liberals
who represent radical change. That is in large part because at the
beginning of the campaign, Charest said he would diminish the
provincial government's role in Quebec's economy and open it up to
market forces.
