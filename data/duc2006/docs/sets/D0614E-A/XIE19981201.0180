<HEADLINE> PQ Re-elected in Quebec Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois
(PQ) won enough seats to form a majority government in Monday's
general election in the French-speaking province of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 75 seats in
Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the latest
reports from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
</P>
<P>
PQ's main rival, the Liberal Party led by Jean Charest, got 48
seats, while the Action Democratique party secured one seat from
a total of 124 seats up for grabs on Monday, CBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The 125th seat will be decided in a by-election in December
because of the recent death of the PQ candidate.
</P>
<P>
The current election mirrored the results from the 1994
election, when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberal 47 and the Action
Democratique party one seat.
</P>
<P>
The re-election of the PQ government was widely believed to
have much impact on the future of both Quebec and the country of
Canada as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if
re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec
independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech to cheering supporters Monday night, Bouchard
only briefly mentioned the referendum issue, while dwelling on
good government and attacks on Canada's federal government.
</P>
<P>
"We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning
referendum on Quebec sovereignty," Bouchard said of the referendum
issue.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa late Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said his government will cooperate with the re-elected
Bouchard government if the latter respected the desire of
Quebecers to improve economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
"But when he (Bouchard) talks about bringing together his
famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold
another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend
our country," Chretien warned.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls also indicated that more than 60 percent of Quebec
people did not want to see another referendum in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the previous two referendums in 1980 and 1995, Quebecers
twice voted "No" to the province's secession from the Canadian
confederation.
</P>
<P>
While conceding his defeat, Liberal leader Jean Charest said
that both Canadians and Quebecers could take heart from the result
of the election.
</P>
<P>
"The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of
Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours
to work and be a success," he noted.
