<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ottawa, Quebec in War of Words over Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unity minister Stephane
Dion has fired off another volley of words at Quebec's separatist
government in an emotional debate over the province's future.
</P>
<P>
In his latest letter to the Quebec government, Canadian
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion warned that
Quebec's unilateral secession from Canada would be not only
illegal, but impossible.
</P>
<P>
"Without the support of the Canadian government, a declaration
of independence would not be recognized by the international
community," Dion wrote in the four-page letter, which was
published today.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1945, no state created by secession has been admitted to
the United Nations without the approval of the government of the
predecessor state," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion "is not
allowed to speak for the international community."
</P>
<P>
"He can speak for himself, maybe for the federal government but
surely not for the world," Bouchard told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The letter was Dion's second within two weeks in an blistering
exchange of words between Ottawa and the French-speaking province,
which has been threatening to form a country of its own.
</P>
<P>
The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard
sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing
to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes.
</P>
<P>
In his first letter to Premier Bouchard, the unity minister
warned that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"Neither you nor I nor anyone else can predict that the borders
of an independent Quebec would be those now guaranteed by the
Canadian Constitution," Dion wrote.
</P>
<P>
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some
English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said
they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from
the country.
</P>
<P>
Dion also asserted that Quebec cannot simply decide
unilaterally to separate from the Canadian federation.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the notion that 50-percent-plus-one majority Yes
vote would be suffice for the province to leave Canada.
</P>
<P>
To this, Quebec deputy premier Bernard Landry shot back with a
letter, denouncing Dion's letter as anti-democratic and an attempt
to "change the rules of the game."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the latest letter-writings by Dion suggest
that Ottawa is warming up for another showdown with Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare
that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful.
The case is scheduled to begin this fall.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Quebec will hold a provincial
election next year. If Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois win, the
election would be very likely to be followed by another referendum
on Quebec's future.
</P>
<P>
"We are heading towards a new referendum, and there's going to
be more heat," predicted Professor Benoit Pelletier of the
University of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
There is already speculation that Ottawa is toughening its
stance on Quebec, focusing less on the so-called "Plan A", which
involves reconciliation, and more on "Plan B", which stresses
"rules of secession."
