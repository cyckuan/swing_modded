<HEADLINE> Quebec Partition Likely After Separation, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians believe
that the province of Quebec will face partition if it separates
from Canada, according to a poll published today.
</P>
<P>
A Southam News/Compas poll found that up to 78 percent of
Canadians outside the French-speaking province anticipate it to
lose land as part of the price of independence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 50 percent of Quebecers agree that if Canada
is divisible, so is Quebec, according to the poll, which surveyed
2,450 people across the country from May 1 to 7.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 92 percent of Canadians living outside
Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to
stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by an overwhelming 75 percent of Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
The poll results came as the Quebec issue moves to center stage
in the ongoing national election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Further, the results suggest that if Quebecers believe that
voting Yes would mean partition, they would be much less likely to
vote Yes.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of partition benefits the federalist side," said
Compas chairman Conrad Winn. "This may explain the sometimes
intense reaction of sovereignists to any discussion of the topic."
</P>
<P>
Before the 1995 referendum, the partition of Quebec was an idea
confined to only a few federalist pundits.
</P>
<P>
The narrow win of the No side by 50.6 percent of the vote made
many people to consider seriously what they would do if the Yes
side ever won a majority.
</P>
<P>
"It's the logical answer: if Canada is divisible, so is
Quebec," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien noted shortly after
the referendum.
