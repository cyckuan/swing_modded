<HEADLINE> Supreme Court to Hear Quebec Case in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is
set to hear the case of Quebec separation in early December,
according to a draft agenda released today.
</P>
<P>
The court has set aside December 8, 9 and 10 to hear arguments
on whether the French-speaking province has the right to break
away the country.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government said that it will not participate in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on
three subjects:
</P>
<P>
-- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law?
</P>
<P>
-- Does International law give the province a right to secede?
</P>
<P>
-- If domestic and international law conflict, which take precedence?
</P>
<P>
Quebec cannot unilaterally declare independence though it could
leave lawfully through a constitutional amendment after discussing
with the federal government and other provinces, Ottawa argues.
</P>
<P>
But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be
made only by the people of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The case is viewed here as part of Ottawa's "Plan B" strategy,
which stresses "rules of secession".
