OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled
here Thursday that Quebec can't separate from the country
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the 9-member court
said, the mainly French-speaking province cannot separate from Canada
under the Constitution of Canada and the international law.
</P>
<P>
But the top court said, the Canadian government would be
obliged to negotiate with Quebec if the mainly French-speaking
province won a voter referendum on independence.
