   ``Negotiations following such a referendum would undoubtedly be
difficult. While negotiators would have to contemplate the
possibility of secession, there would be no absolute entitlement to
it and no assumption that an agreement reconciling all relevant
rights and obligations would actually be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is foreseeable that even negotiations carried out in
conformity with the underlying constitutional principles could
reach an impasse. We need not speculate here as to what would then
transpire,'' the opinion said.

<P>
   Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for
independence was a risky strategy for the federal government
because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist
government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials, shaken by the near victory of the
separatists in the October 1995 referendum on separation, had
decided it was far more risky to just sit back and do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the
sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum. In the
first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists
gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province
where the referendum was held.
</P>
<P>
   In the October 1995 referendum, Quebec's vote in favor of
separation had increased to just over 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the
Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into
thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy.
According to published reports, separatist leaders planned to
declare independence and gain recognition of the new country from
France and the United States within days after the 1995 referendum
if they had won, despite promises of a period of negotiation with
the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said it is unlikely the United States
would have recognized an independent Quebec that seceded without
the consent of the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa government decided in 1996 to join a suit filed by a
federalist in Quebec asking the Supreme Court for an opinion on the
constitutional legality of a unilateral Quebec secession.
</P>
<P>
   Such opinions are called references and while not legally
binding, they are important because of the moral and legal
authority of the court. The Supreme Court has issued 74 references
since 1892.
</P>
<P>
   The court limited its opinion strictly to the questions asked by
the federal government and did not touch several other sensitive
issues. For example, it left up to politicians to decide whether
``a clear majority'' meant 51 percent of votes cast or some more
rigorous standard.
</P>
<P>
   The court also avoided the question of whether a Quebec that
decides to leave Canada could then be partitioned because northern
Indian tribes, like the Cree, have said firmly that they want to
remain in Canada.
