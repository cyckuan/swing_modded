<HEADLINE> Summit Draws Attention to Acadia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The land known as Acadia  
disappeared from maps nearly 300 years ago, when the French 
colonial settlement was lost to the British after years of war for 
what are now Canada's maritime provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	But Acadians and their culture are alive and well in  
French-speaking New Brunswick, perfectly happy to remain part of 
Canada and deeply distrustful of the independence aspirations of 
their fellow Francophones in nearby Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no coincidence that Canada chose to highlight the Acadians  
at a Francophone summit here this weekend -- to show that not all 
French Canadians support Quebec's sovereignty and actually fear 
what an independent Quebec might mean for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can live together in harmony. We're a good example to  
Quebec,'' said Roger Gaudet, a father of four who can trace his 
family history back to an original French settlement in Nova 
Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300,000 people of Acadian descent in Canada's Atlantic  
provinces -- New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and 
Newfoundland - worry most that an independent Quebec will only make 
it harder for them to preserve the French culture they have fought 
for 300 years to retain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The balance of power between Anglos and Francophones rests on  
a strong Quebec presence at the federal level,'' said Maurice 
Basque, director of Acadian studies at the University of Moncton, 
the largest Francophone university in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without Quebec, the question will become: `Will Canada remain  
bilingual?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec's sovereignty has been put on the back page for the time  
being, after voters rejected sovereignty in successive referendums 
in recent years. Secessionists are vowing to try again in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec legislator Francine Lalonde said the province will one  
day be its own country -- with or without support from Acadians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Quebec will be a French country in association  
with Canada would be a plus for them in all sorts of ways,'' she 
said. Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools 
and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of the Acadian argument against separation for  
Quebec is their own history and the event that defined them -- the 
deportation of 10,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia by Britain 
beginning in 1755 for refusing to swear allegiance to the queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many resettled in Louisiana, where they are now called Cajuns,  
but others returned to the provinces to reclaim the land of their 
ancestors and rekindle their French identity with Canada's 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Acadians make up about a third of the population of New  
Brunswick -- too small a minority to challenge Ottawa for 
independence, but large enough to have successfully lobbied for 
public schools that teach entirely in French. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute to  
their courage, telling a crowd of several hundred people how 
honored he was to be among so many people loyal to France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the immense road your people have traveled since the  
tragic ordeals that have marked your identity for centuries,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That recognition is enough to keep Acadians content with the  
status quo, said Acadian student Eric Larocque. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acadia was erased from the maps in the 1700s,'' he said. ``It  
doesn't exist but in the hearts of those who fought to save our 
language and culture.''
