<P>
   QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti
Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province,
possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest
of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday
night, the separatist party had 42.8 percent of the vote, compared
with 43.6 percent for the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and
12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action. The separatists
were expected to win 77 of the provincial assembly's 125 seats, the
Liberals 46 and Democratic Action 1, with one seat unfilled because
of a death during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected
defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on
whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an
end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to
separate.
</P>
<P>
   With results still trickling in, the separatists were projected
to take roughly the same number of districts in the provincial
assembly as in 1994, with roughly the same percentage of the
overall vote as in the last election. Bouchard had been counting on
a gain of several seats to solidify his support.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists fell short of the 46 percent they had said they
needed to succeed in a third referendum to take Quebec out of
Canada and form an independent nation of roughly seven million
people on the northern border of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists have lost two previous referendums, one
decisively in 1980, the other narrowly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's support is strongest among French-speaking voters,
who are more evenly spread throughout the province than English
speakers, who are concentrated in and around the city of Montreal
and who traditionally vote for the Liberals and against separation.
It was the third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, who seemed to have
drawn votes from the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold
another referendum in the four to five years of his government if
``winning conditions'' existed. While he never defined those
conditions, it was widely believed that one of them was a level of
popular support above 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for
separation has declined. Recent polls indicate that only 43 percent
of Quebecers would vote yes in another referendum on independence,
a drop of four percentage points during the course of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past few weeks, I have had the feeling that were it
not for the issue of sovereignty, a greater number of English
speaking Quebeckers would have supported our program,'' Bouchard
said in a restrained victory speech before supporters here in
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned sovereighnty only once, repeating his pledge to
create the ``winning conditions'' under which a referendum could be
won. But he also acknowledged that the lower than expected level of
support for his party reflected a disastisfaction among voters that
he could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the signal you sent by choosing candidates who
reflect their attachnment to Canada,'' he said. ``We have decided
to stay the course no matter what political decisions the people of
Quebec make for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be taking place, analysts said, is that
Quebecers see this election as a vote on government, not on
independence, so separatist emotions are in check. But voters want
Bouchard to keep alive the possibility of another referendum on
separation as a way of increasing the province's leverage with
Ottawa in upcoming discussions about changes in the shape of
Canadian federalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a referendum, Bouchard's re-election would increase
tensions and uncertainty in Canada. During the campaign, he said he
would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation,
forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not
just to Quebec but to all 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In one stroke, he silenced the critics in his own party who
suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central
government, and he undercut the position of Charest, who equated a
vote for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want, and Quebecers don't want, to be divided during
the next four years,'' Charest said in a concession speech in his
home district of Sherbrooke, where he narrowly regained his seat in
the provincial assembly. He said he would not resign, but would
fight as leader of the opposition to bring Quebec together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want
this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government
it has,'' Charest said.
</P>
<P>
   When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge
Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little
chance of retaining power. Many in English Canada believed that if
Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a
moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could
end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has
been diluted by immigration and demographic change.
</P>
<P>
   But Charest's campaign never caught on. It is expected that
there will now be calls for his resignation, and that of Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who is against changes to the Canadian
federation.

</P>
<P>
   The failure of Charest to win support in his home province was
just one surprise among many in this election that seemed to settle
very little except Bouchard's reputation as one of Quebec's most
popular and adept political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the strangest election I have ever seen in my
life,'' said Pierre Roy, 61, a retired businessman from Lac
Beauport, near Quebec city. ``Bouchard's posters said `Have
confidence,' but people are afraid about what's going to happen.''
Roy voted just after polls opened at 10 a.m. on a gray day marked
with freezing rain and snow in many parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
   While Quebec's future is still uncertain, the outcome of the
election was predicted by public opinion polls weeks ago. Unlike
past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial
markets spiraling downward, the projected results appeared to have
been discounted already.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar actually strengthened slightly , closing at
a value of 65 U.S. cents. The Toronto Stock Exchange declined just
under 2 percent on a day when most markets around the world were
also down for reasons that had nothing to do with the election
here.
</P>
<P>
   The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is
based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated
fairly by English speaking Canada. Most popular among young voters,
the movement seeks to preserve and strengthen Quebecois culture.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical wing of the party pushes for outright
independence, but more moderate members say they want to negotiate
something less than a separate nation, perhaps an economic
relationship with the rest of Canada that allows them to keep their
Canadian passports and their Canadian currency but have control
over language, culture and many other social considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists have often tried to portray the process of secession
as straightforward and relatively painless. But that does not take
into account such issues as dividing the national debt,
compensation for federal property and Quebec's place in
international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Canada would not vote in a referendum, but would
have to negotiate the terms of secession, a difficult process at
best. In addition, the Cree Indians who live in northern Quebec and
roughly 700,000 English speakers in the Montreal area who want to
stay in Canada would be likely to insist on the partition of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-day election campaign _ the shortest in Quebec history _
was marked by a frantic pace of speeches and rallies, and one
debate on Nov. 17 that was seen by many viewers as a virtual tie
between Bouchard and Charest. Dumont, of the Democratic Action
Party, also appeared in the debate, and his strong performance was
believed to have hurt Charest.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the campaign generated little real emotion, despite
expectations that it would be a clash of titans. However, the
results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction
between Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to
holding a third referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through
another referendum, but that they believe the threat of separation
is useful to bringing about changes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no people yelling slogans in the street or things
like that,'' said Gilles Paquet, director of the Center on
Governance at the University of Ottawa. ``Instead, what you saw
today is the rational vote by a group that feels it can do better
in the Canadian federation by electing a separatist government.''
</P>
<P>
   What appears certain is that the results of Monday's election
will set all of Canada on another painful round of introspection
and soul-searching about the identity and nature of the country.
</P>
<P>
   This period could be different, however, because Bouchard _ an
experienced negotiator _ has introduced a new element that
substantially changes the picture. In one of the many major shifts
in the positions that he took during the campaign, he hinted that
before calling a referendum on independence, he would push Ottawa
for a freer hand in spending on social issues, especially health.
</P>
<P>
   Under Canada's national medical system, delivering health care
is the responsibility of each of the 10 provinces. But the federal
government provides about 70 percent of the money that the
provinces spend on health care and imposes many standards and
restrictions on how the money can be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard and the premiers of the other nine provinces signed an
agreement at a meeting last summer to explore a new arrangement
that would give the provinces more flexibility, including the
chance to get money from Ottawa without participating in the
federal system.
</P>
<P>
   For Bouchard, it appears to be a strategy that cannot lose. If
Ottawa gives in to the demands, Bouchard can tell the people of
Quebec that he wrested an important concession from Prime Minister
Chretien, who has strongly opposed giving any more powers to the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   If Ottawa refuses, Bouchard can say that he had tried to
negotiate in good faith but was rejected. That could represent one
of the ``winning conditions'' that he said must be apparent before
he calls for another referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
   What is uncertain, analysts say, is how much resentment would be
generated by Ottawa's rebuff of the new federalism, and how that
resentment would affect a vote on separation.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bouchard signed the agreement with the other premiers last
summer, little attention has been paid to the issue in Quebec. But
polls indicate that a majority of Quebecers want Bouchard to
negotiate a new federal union.
</P>
<P>
   By imposing the requirement of ``winning conditions'' on another
referendum, and by raising the question of negotiating changes in
Canadian federalism with Ottawa, Bouchard has left himself so many
options that there is no way to know his exact plans.
