   MONTREAL _ Anywhere he goes in Quebec, from a secluded
restaurant on the east side of Montreal to the hardware aisles at
the Canadian Tire store in suburban St. Leonard, Claude Meunier
makes heads turn.
</P>
<P>
   But if the wildly popular star of Quebec's most watched
television program, and the man who helped make Quebec the only
place in Canada where Pepsi outsells Coke, happens to step across
the provincial border into Ontario or anywhere else in Canada,
Meunier's puckish face elicits not the slightest whisper or buzz of
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Language, of course, divides the predominantly French-speaking
province of Quebec from most of the rest of Canada _ and the rest
of North America, for that matter. And since Meunier's comedy and
commercials are done in French, his audience is basically limited
to the province.
</P>
<P>
   But language doesn't completely explain how different this
province is from the rest of the United States' largest neighbor,
or why at times like these _ when the province is holding critical
elections that will determine whether there will be another
referendum on separation _ the rest of Canada seems to be so at
wit's end trying to understand what is going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, something as trivial as traffic. Quebec is
the only province in Canada that does not allow drivers to make a
right turn at a red light. It never has, in part because
transportation officials believe it is not safe, despite the
experience of the rest of the country, and most of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers stand out in many other ways. They smoke more, get
divorced more and, according to one recent poll by the Southam
Newspaper chain, are more stressed out than people in the rest of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More of them tend to be apartment dwellers, more of them rent
their homes rather than own them and more of them rely on electric
heat than anywhere else in the country, in part because Quebec
produces more hydroelectric power than any other Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Quebecers, to be different is good, even if it doesn't
always make much sense,'' said Ted Nation, an advertising executive
who lived and worked in Montreal for many years. ``Being different
helps them express who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, the differences are actually
reflections of a deep and seemingly unbridgeable abyss that
separates the 7 million Quebecers from the 22 million people in the
rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a question of character as a perception of
history,'' said Lise Bissonnette, a French-Canadian author and
former editor of the separatist newspaper Le Devoir. ``It has to do
with the way Quebecers see their country and that's the basic
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that this is a province where every automobile
license plate bears the fighting words ``Je me souviens'' _ `I
remember' _ and where many people have trouble thinking of Quebec
as just another province like tiny Prince Edward Island. Quebec is,
they insist, usually invoking the history of New France in North
America, a founding partner in the very concept of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what makes Quebecers different is that we are trying
to help our language and our culture survive, and this keeps us
very much alive,'' said Meunier during a lunch-time interview just
after he had finished filming the last episode of the season of his
series, ``Le Petite Vie'' (which roughly translates to `The Daily
Life').
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Montreal comic, whose success allowed him to buy
a vacation house in Maine recently, said the tension of sustaining
a small island of French in a sea of English speakers in North
America gives artists and performers in Quebec a spirit that
energizes their work.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why the arts flourish in Quebec, even though
very little makes its way into the rest of Canada. According to one
recent survey, of 3,500 French books published in Quebec, only 40
were translated into English. And the record for translating
English into French is just as grim.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers discovered the television program ``Baywatch'' two
years later than everyone else in North America, and they still
don't know who Ally McBeal is because the show isn't dubbed in
French yet. While most of what the rest of Canada watches on
television is produced in the United States, more than 70 percent
of prime time programming in Quebec is produced in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And Meunier's weekly television sitcom is the most popular of
all. The streets are deserted in many French-speaking towns when
the show is broadcast Monday evenings at 7:30. Several episodes
this season reached over 3.3 million viewers, out of 4 million
people who were watching television at the time, giving the show
the equivalent of a weighty 74 share. By contrast, the recent
widely watched interview with Dr. Jack Kevorkian on ``60 Minutes''
got a 24 market share.

<P>
   ``Le Petite Vie'' began as a proposed 15-minute filler sketch
before the Saturday night hockey game on the French service of CBC
five years ago. Meunier, who was already a popular comedian _ and
instantly recognizable in the province because of the successful
soft drink commercials _ insisted that a full situation comedy
based on homespun Quebec characters could succeed, just as the soft
drink commercials worked because Quebecers recognized themselves in
the spots.
</P>
<P>
   His oddball comedy is a cross between All in the Family and The
Simpsons, with him as the father of a strange family and his
longtime comedic partner Serge Theriault as the mother. It is
impenetrable to viewers outside of Quebec even if they can
understand the heavily accented French.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about life, about Quebecois life,'' he says, but it also
stresses universal characteristics like jealousy, immodesty, vanity
and arrogance. It also tends to poke fun at the personality faults
that Quebecers know well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent episode, which aired just a week before the
Nov. 30 elections for control of the provincial government, the
characters addressed the serious question of independence in a way
that Canadians elsewhere in the nation would have trouble
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebec would become a country like Sweden,'' boasts one
character, repeating a promise separatist leaders have used to
justify their attempts to create a country with only 7 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I wouldn't vote for independence,'' says the family's
daft daughter, ``because it would be full of Ikea things.'' She was
referring to the Swedish company that sells furniture that has to
be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean,'' she says, pursuing logic that makes
Quebecers howl, but leaves other Canadians shaking their heads, ``I
might not be able to put together my own country.''
