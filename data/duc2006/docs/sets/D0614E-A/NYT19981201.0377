ANALYSIS: QUEBEC'S WOUNDED SEPARATISTS 
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL _ While the results of Quebec's provincial election are
muddy enough for both major parties to claim a victory of sorts,
and to bear some degree of defeat, the real losers are those who
had hoped the election would provide a clear sense of where Quebec,
and Canada, are heading.
</P>
<P>
   Although the separatists were returned to power, they could not
even muster a plurality of the popular vote. The election results
keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded.
</P>
<P>
   That means Premier Lucien Bouchard will not call another
wrenching referendum on breaking away from Canada any time soon,
though he has not ruled out doing so later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebecers have said that the time is not propitious for a
referendum, at least not immediately,'' Bouchard said Tuesday at a
news conference in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   He is clearly disappointed that he had not increased the number
of seats his party holds in the provincial assembly. Nor was he
able to maintain the percentage of the overall vote his party had
in the last elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti
Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal
Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase
of one. A small third party won one seat, and a special election
will be held in a few weeks for one district where the incumbent
died recently. That district is expected to go to the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   In the popular vote, which is seen as an indication of probable
strength for sovereignty, the separatists got 42.7 percent, while
the Liberals won 43.7 percent. A clear majority would be needed for
a referendum to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Bouchard refused to rule out completely the possibility of
holding another vote on separation. Instead, he reiterated the
position he took during the campaign: that he would call a
referendum _ which he has the right to do at any time during his
term _ when he could be sure it was winnable.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign Bouchard did not spell out the conditions
under which he would consider the vote winnable, and he skirted the
issue again Tuesday. But he has made it clear that several problems
must be tackled before conditions are ripe for another referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first was to be re-elected, but the separatists'
poorer-than-expected showing suggests that Bouchard will need
substantially more time than he had thought to lay the groundwork
for another referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how Bouchard can call a referendum in the near
future,'' said Francois Rocher, a professor of political science at
Carleton University in Ottawa. ``He was elected on good government
and now he will have to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said the first part of his term would be ``devoted to
achieving good government'' that would create winning conditions
for a referendum. He is nearing his goal of eliminating the
province's budget deficit, after several years of painful cuts.
Achieving that would be a sign of fiscal responsibility that the
separatists would use to build confidence in their ability to lead
an independent nation.

<P>
   Beyond the budget, Bouchard will soon have to deal with Quebec's
large public employee unions, which have been without a contract
since June. And he is committed to negotiating a new deal with the
federal government, along with the leaders of the other nine
provinces, for more provincial control over health care and other
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   If the negotiations for a new federal relationship break down,
Bouchard could blame Ottawa and use resentment toward the federal
government to boster support for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's separatist predecessors as provincial premier
committed themselves to holding referendums without taking into
account whether conditions were ripe for a victory. Both previous
referendums were defeated, even though support for separation in
Quebec has at times risen to around 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bouchard refused to speculate about how long he was
willing to wait for his ``winning conditions'' to develop. He said
only that he would ``take the time that it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, some basic assumptions about Quebec were
openly questioned for the first time. The charge by the leader of
the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, that 30 years of toying with
separation had only hurt Quebec economically resonated with many
voters, including some French-speaking Quebecers. He also called
for limits to the provincial government's interference in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard will also have to deal with the defection of some soft
nationalists _ voters whose support for separation fluctuates _ to
the young, third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, leader of the
Democratic Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Dumont, 28, doubled his party's share of the popular vote,
although he was the only member who won a seat in the provincial
assembly. He called for a ten-year moratorium on referendums and
advocated free market measures, although he did not go as far as
Charest.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which aspects of Quebec life will continue to be
overshadowed by politics after the election was made clear early
Tuesday. The Canadian Olympic Committee announced that it had
turned down Quebec city in favor of Vancouver's bid to represent
Canada in vying for the 2010 winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The vote actually was taken 10 days ago but the announcement of
the results was delayed until Tuesday to avoid having any influence
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec politicians wasted no time in calling Tuesday's decision
political.
