<HEADLINE> Bouchard Expected to Become Quebec Separatist Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to
become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of
this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight
Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts.
</P>
<P>
He will be proclaimed the leader of Party Quebecois at a
special party meeting in Montreal on January 27 and will probably
be sworn in as premier two days later. He will resign as leader of
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti
Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his
resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence
was defeated. He took over the leadership from Parizeau in the
referendum campaign and he was credited with his role in the final
campaign which brought separatists to a near victory from the
hopeless mood.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the
independence movement in the province alive.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard has promised to tackle the province's deficit crisis
and to create a climate for economic growth. Opinions show that
most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its
attention to the economy rather than independence after the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Quebec has serious financial problems with one of the biggest
debt and tax burdens in Canada. In an editorial, the Montreal
daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to
governing and tackling the "very serious social, economic and
fiscal problems" facing Quebeckers.
</P>
<P>
But Bouchard never hid his goal of Quebec independence. He told
quebeckers on the referendum night, last November that next
referendum could come sooner than they think.
</P>
<P>
News reports said earlier that Bouchard will consider a fall
election in Quebec. The election, assuming that he would win,
would position him to hold another referendum on independence next
year.
