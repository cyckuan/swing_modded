<HEADLINE> Two Venezuelan Oil Executives Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Two more high-level executives  
resigned from Venezuela's powerful state oil monopoly on Thursday, 
following the company head's resignation in a dispute over 
production and management policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Mandini resigned Monday as president of Petroleos de  
Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company and one of the top 
two suppliers to the United States. He was replaced by company Vice 
President Hector Ciavaldini, a close ally of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has said he wants to shake up Petroleos de Venezuela,  
which he has called a ``state within a state'' that enjoys an 
extravagant ``gold-card culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a total of five executives have quit. including  
three vice-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Marquez, communications director at Petroleos de  
Venezuela, and Antonieta Mendoza de Lopez, corporate affairs 
coordinator, are the latest to retire, a company official told Dow 
Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has moved to reverse a company policy aimed at expanding  
production, opting instead to reduce output in order to raise 
prices. Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year but 
have more than doubled since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts said Chavez might endanger the company's  
reputation by filling key posts with people known more for their 
political loyalty than energy expertise. They said Ciavaldini had 
been promoted because of his political connections with Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini, a trained chemical engineer with a doctorate from  
the University of London, was appointed vice president of the 
company by Chavez in February.
