	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In the latest attack on Venezuela's  
president, a leading writer says Hugo Chavez is imposing 
authoritarian rule on one of Latin America's longest-running 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	Arturo Uslar Pietri, one of the nation's most famous writers,  
criticized Chavez's promotion of 34 military officials without 
congressional approval as required by law and his declaration last 
week that Congress should be temporarily shut down. He described 
the president's actions as a ``coup d'etat,'' said the El Universal 
newspaper Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez, a former army paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup  
attempt in the name of the poor, shot back at his critics Sunday, 
describing them as part of a corrupt political elite that has 
ruined the oil-rich country.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian government plans to  
sell off billions of dollars' worth of state properties, ranging 
from buildings and empty lots to beaches and ecological reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, which owns three million properties worth an  
estimated $400 billion, will sell off as many assets as it can to 
the highest bidder at auctions later this year, the newspaper O 
Globo reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrative Secretary Claudia Costin, who ordered a study to  
evaluate each property, said the buyers will not be allowed to 
erect buildings on lands that are now ecological reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso assumed power in 1995,  
privatizations have been a major part of his economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardoso administration has sold off state mining, railway  
and utility companies, including the largest privatization in Latin 
American history. Last July, the telecommunications giant Telebras 
fetched the equivalent of $19 billion.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's military is investigating  
reports that Peruvian guerrillas have infiltrated a remote border 
region in the Amazon jungle, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shining Path guerrillas have reportedly built a supply base in  
the western Amazon basin state of Acre, near Brazil's border with 
Peru and Colombia, the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air force says it will increase its monitoring in the Acre  
border region; the army says it will build a fort there within a 
year.
