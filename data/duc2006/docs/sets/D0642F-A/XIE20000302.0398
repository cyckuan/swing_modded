CARACAS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
rejected Thursday a United States' request to permit its planes to
over-fly Venezuelan airspace in the war against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that his government cooperates with the U.S.
authorities in their war against drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said in Uruguay, when he attended the new president of
that country, Jorge Batlle swearing in, that he understands it as
a limiting decision of an operation fundamentally directed against
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysts, Venezuela does not want to
complicate more the relations between those two countries, because
it wants to be a factor of harmony instead of aggressions, direct
or indirect.
</P>
<P>
The United States approved Wednesday the Venezuelan war against
drugs, and also that of other Latin American countries, like
Colombia and Mexico.
