VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO REWRITE CONSTITUTION 
 (DW)

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ In his first hours in office, President
Hugo Chavez Frias sent tremors through the political establishment
by moving to rewrite the Constitution in a process that is highly
likely to replace the newly elected Congress with one that has more
of his allies.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez and his supporters, the 1961 Constitution is a symbol
of a corrupt political system that has fed popular resentment and
apathy. It was written by leaders of the two traditional parties,
Accion Democratica and Copei, to keep Marxist groups aligned at the
time with Cuban-backed guerrillas out of the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marxist and socialist groups in the coalition that elected
Chavez sorely want to replace the document. As he took his oath of
office on Tuesday, Chavez called the Constitution moribund even as
he pledged to uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution, and with it the ill-fated political system
to which it gave birth 40 years ago, has to die,'' Chavez said in
his address. ``It is going to die, Sirs. Accept it!''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign leading to his landslide victory in December,
Chavez said that he wanted to replace the ban on presidential
re-election, opening the way for him to run for a second five-year
term in 2003. That led to warnings from opponents that Chavez, who
as an army officer started an unsuccessful coup against the
civilian government in 1992, was still a power-seeking
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also said he hoped that a new Constitution would take
politics out of the judiciary by replacing the congressional
appointment of judges with one based on selection by a board of
legal scholars. He expressed hopes that a new Constitution would
also replace the system in which party bosses manage the selection
of congressional candidates and then control their votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaigns last year, Chavez's opponents said that a
referendum to form an assembly with powers to draft a new
constitution would be unconstitutional. But last month the Supreme
Court backed Chavez's position, and congressional leaders said that
Congress should call for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chavez issued the referendum decree, saying that
Congress should focus its energies on economic policy. His decree
set in motion a year of campaigning over three referendums, one on
whether to rewrite the Constitution, a second to elect delegates to
the assembly that would rewrite the Constitution and a third on
ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition leaders criticized Chavez for circumventing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But most, apparently reluctant to take on Chavez at the height
of his popularity, had words of mild praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government that needs cooperation,'' said Alcibiades
Castro, congressional leader of Copei.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hopes that a series of ballot victories over the next
year will bolster his support among voters as he takes unpopular
measures like slashing government payrolls and imposing new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators, all elected to five-year terms, widely are
expected to resign to run for the assembly. Chavez's coalition
holds about a third of the seats in each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Chavez believes by making the Congress more
representative it will be more favorable to him,'' a Western
diplomat who insisted on anonymity said. ``This process gets him
off to a very powerful start.''
