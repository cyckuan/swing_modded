	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A left-wing coalition led by a former
coup leader has become the top force in Venezuela's new Congress,
initial results showed Monday, in a major setback for the two
political parties that have governed for 40 years since the
restoration of democracy.
	   With 67 percent of Sunday's vote counted, Hugo Chavez's
Patriotic Pole coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats.
The center-left Democratic Action Party won about 22 percent, and
the conservative Copei Party won 11 percent.
	   The pro-business Project Venezuela emerged with about 12 percent
of the vote.
	   The 44-year-old Chavez, an independent supported by millions of
peasants and shantytown dwellers, is the favorite to win the Dec. 6
presidential election.
	   In 1992, he staged an unsuccessful military revolt against the
government and became a hero to many for denouncing corruption and
speaking out on behalf of the poor. He spent two years in prison
and was released in 1994 by President Rafael Caldera.
	   Investors reacted negatively to the strong electoral showing by
his coalition, with the Caracas stock exchange dropping 3.2 percent
Monday morning.
	   Many investors and businessmen fear Chavez will reverse
free-market policies implemented during the last two years by
President Rafael Caldera.
