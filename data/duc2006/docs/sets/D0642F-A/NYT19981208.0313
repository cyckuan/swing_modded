MAN IN THE NEWS: HUGO CHAVEZ FRIAS, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
VENEZUELA

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With his landslide victory Sunday securing
his place as the next president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez Frias
might have been expected to smooth over the tracks of his first
attempt to storm the presidential palace here, in 1992, in case
other revolutionaries got the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he highlighted the failed coup, along with the day he
left prison two years later. ``What we're living through in
Venezuela is the continuation of February 4, 1992,'' Chavez told
crowds of euphoric supporters, many sporting his trademark
military-style red beret, who had turned out to revel in the
triumph of the man they call ``El Commandante.''
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason for Chavez to celebrate the doomed revolt.
For the 44-year-old former paratrooper, the coup forged his
credentials as the undeniable outsider, whose day would come as
Venezuela's economy sank deeper and its people grew more doubtful
of the traditional ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's victory has opened not so much a new page, as a new
tome, in Venezuelan politics. At a time when the rest of Latin
America has been moving largely toward streamlining the role of
government and selling off state assets, Chavez speaks of
subordinating the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, to
domestic priorities, and asks whether $9 billion earmarked for
operations and investment by the oil company should not go to shore
up decaying schools and hospitals instead.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez soared to victory on fiery rhetoric that promised fry the
heads of traditional political bosses but he immediately soften his
message upon victory to persuade investors that Venezuela was still
safe for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in the first day of trading after the election, the
tiny Caracas stock exchange jumped a record 22 percent and the
currency strengthened against the dollar after a long slide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chavez failed to overthrow former President Carlos Andres
Perez, the coup succeeded in other ways: it took the place of party
machinery and war chests, celebrity endorsements and hours of
campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he languished in prison, the mystique grew of the
restless lieutenant colonel condemned for trying to destroy a
system that many Venezuelans recognized as rotted but felt
powerless to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seen as someone who told the truth about the system,''
said one diplomatic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after President Rafael Caldera freed Chavez _ in a bid
to deflate the commandante's swelling popularity _ Chavez created
his Fifth Bolivarian Movement and began taking his war on
corruption to the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   The son of school teachers who grew up poor in the state of
Barinas, he surrounded himself with a contradictory klatch of
right-wing nationalists from the military and other figures hailing
from the left.
</P>
<P>
   With such an odd mix, some political analysts thought he would
go nowhere. Last December, opinion polls showed him with less than
12 percent support among likely voters. But slowly, perhaps even
unconsciously, his red-bereted image was moving in from the
fringes, to dominate the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people hadn't counted on was the real depth of disgust
Venezuelans had for traditional politics,'' said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel also benefited from a souring economy and a beauty
queen's mistakes. Until last spring, Irene Saez, a former Miss
Universe, had been leading in voter surveys, peaking at 35.7
percent to Chavez's 20.6 percent. Then the price of oil, which
underpins Venezuela's entire economy, fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from an optimistic country to a pessimistic one, with
expectations that things will get worse,'' said Luis Vicente Leon,
director of the Datanalysis polling agency. The following month,
Miss Saez accepted a luke warm endorsement from one of the two
traditional parties. The backing compromised her claims to being an
outsider and her popularity ratings slid into the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it was the turn of Henrique Salas Roemer, a former
governor of Carabobo State, educated at Yale. Salas, 62, climbed
aboard a white horse, called Frijolito, or Little Bean, for
campaign rallies. But his claims to being a warrior for the people
also weakened with a last-minute endorsement from the major
parties. Salas rode Frijolito through the streets of Caracas for
his final rally.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the final vote, Chavez, who was frequently criticized
for altering his positions depending on his audiences, succeeded in
capturing some 40 percent of the upper and middle-class vote, on
top of his bedrock support among the poor, said Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez plans to hold a referendum Feb. 15 to rewrite the
Constitution, which some political opponents fear could be a
mechanism for concentrating power in his office.
</P>
<P>
   While Chavez gives voice _ and a roaring one at that _ to
Venezuela's downtrodden, some fear that populist economic policies
will set the clock back here.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spoke out against privatizing health care, which he
called ``the right of all Venezuelans,'' and has raised the
prospect of a debt moratorium or a grace period for foreign debt,
which he said amounts to 40 percent of the national budget. He has
vowed to raise the minimum wage of just under $200 a month, which
covers only half the cost of the standard food basket for a
family's minimal nutritional needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, he's going to try to deliver on his campaign
promises,'' said Robert Bottome, a publisher of VenEconomy
newsletters, ``The economy will go into a big tailspin and then the
question is, what does he do?''
