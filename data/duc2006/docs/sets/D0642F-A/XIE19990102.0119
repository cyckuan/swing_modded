<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign exchange
reserves closed the year 1998 at 14.85 billion U.S. dollars, down
16.64 percent compared with 1997, the Central Bank of Venezuela
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the drop to foreign debt payments and
central bank policies to defend the Venezuelan currency, the
bolivar, as well as speculative attacks on markets, electoral
expectations and the adverse scenario created by the falling oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said the existing foreign reserves would be
enough to cover imports for at least 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The bolivar faced great pressure last August and September,
but strong intervention by the central bank on the exchange
market and an increase in interest rates helped curb market
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Venezuelan currency recovered after the
landslide victory of Hugo Chavez in the presidential elections on
December 6. It afterwards underwent moderate depreciation.
