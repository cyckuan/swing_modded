	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said
Wednesday he was ``completely sure'' Washington would reverse its
policy of banning him from the United States. Local stocks soared
after his election, he said, because ``we have demonstrated to the
world that we are not savages.''
	   The Caracas stock exchange opened sharply higher for the second
straight day Wednesday, continuing a rally caused by Chavez's
conciliatory statements after his landslide victory Sunday. The
market was up 11.4 percent Wednesday morning, following a record 22
percent hike the previous day.
	   Investors had long feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992
staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, would roll back free market
economic reforms and civil liberties. But his statements in the
last two days promising fiscal discipline and calling for national
reconciliation seem to have calmed investor fears.
	   On Wednesday, the president-elect appointed a 79-year-old
leftist politician named Luis Miquilena to oversee the national
police force as Interior Minister. It wasn't immediately clear if
that decision would affect the markets.
	   Chavez said he met earlier Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador John
Maisto, who he said delivered a letter of congratulations from U.S.
President Bill Clinton. Because of his earlier attempt to overthrow
the government, Chavez was placed on a U.S. list of alien
undesirables barred from entering the United States.
	   In recent days, U.S. officials have to moved to improve
relations with Chavez, whose country is the number one exporter of
oil to the United States.
	   ``I am completely sure that within a few weeks I will be in the
United States,'' Chavez said.
	   On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said that
heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the
United States, adding, ``The U.S. government is prepared to take
the necessary steps to address any request for a visa that
President-elect Chavez may make.''
	   Chavez also met Wednesday morning with President Rafael Caldera
at the Miraflores presidential palace, the first time the former
lieutenant colonel had visited the site since storming it on Feb.
4, 1992 during the failed coup. Palace workers applauded and
cheered him.
	   Caldera, 82, was catapulted to the presidency partly because of
a speech he gave immediately after Chavez's coup, asking why people
would fight for democracy when it ``can't even give them enough to
eat.''
	   ``On the fourth of February two presidents were born,'' said
Chavez, who at 44 will be Venezuela's youngest president.
	   Speaking to reporters Wednesday after his meeting with Caldera,
Chavez said the stock market rally reflected Venezuelans' peaceful
vote for change.
	   ``There is a fresh breeze,'' he said. ``We have broken our
chains.''
	   During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his
plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and
call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution. Economists
say Chavez may have difficulty achieving his economic goals because
of a severe recession caused by slumping oil prices.
	   ``The country voted for transformation and now there is no
turning back,'' he said.
