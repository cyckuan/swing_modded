<HEADLINE> Venezuela May Allow US Drug Flights  </HEADLINE>

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela is reconsidering its refusal to grant
the United States use its airspace for anti-narcotics flights, Vice President
Isaias Rodriguez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries: Venzuela
says the flights infringe on its sovereignty, while U.S. officials say they're
needed to stem the flow of drugs from neighboring Colombia, the world's top
producer of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hugo Chavez's critics say his stance jeopardizes good relations
with the United States, which is Venezuela's No. 1 trading partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, who took office a year ago, has forged a close ties with Cuba and
has spoken of the need to reduce U.S. influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering asked Venezuela again last week to
allow the anti-drug flights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have fully agreed on the need to establish a policy of joint
cooperation to confront the problem of Colombian drugs,'' Rodriguez said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Venezuela was prepared to discuss the flights as long as they
do not violate the country's sovereignty. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States wants to use Venezuela's airspace for flights from three
new staging centers it has set up in Ecuador and the islands of Curacao and
Aruba, just off the Venezuelan coast. The centers were set up following the U.S.
withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone, which had been used for the drug flights.
