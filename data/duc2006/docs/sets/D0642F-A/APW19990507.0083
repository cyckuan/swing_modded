<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Sell Electric Cos. </HEADLINE>

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The government of President Hugo  
Chavez, who campaigned for office deriding what he called savage 
capitalism and neoliberal free-market policies, plans to privatize 
three electric utilities by year end. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks have been held with potential investors for the three  
companies, Enelco, Enerven and Enelbar, said Antonio Giner, the 
newly appointed head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund. He remained 
tightlipped on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Giner also reiterated the government's plan to sell all the  
assets of Venalum, an aluminum operation that makes 430,000 tons a 
year. Giner said Venezuela is also seeking a partner Alcasa, a 
smaller aluminum producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were the government's first formal announcement  
concerning the sale of state assets. Chavez criticized such 
policies during last year's electoral campaign, but has softened 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is selling the companies as part of its plan to  
close a record budget deficit of $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, took office  
three months ago.
