   NEW YORK _ In an effort to reassure foreign investors,
Venezuela's president said Tuesday that his government would make
all its debt payments while at the same time work on a
market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current
debt over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to service our foreign debt, but we want to
reduce the profile,'' President Hugo Chavez said through a
translator at a New York news conference, held in part to give him
a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging
markets in Latin America. Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default
on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from
the devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's news conference was organized by J.P. Morgan
Securities, which is offering the government ideas on ways to
rework its debt. As the session began, Susana de la Puente,
managing director for Latin American investment banking at J.P.
Morgan Securities, noted that there had been ``a lot of bad press
about Venezuela lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chavez nor his finance minister, Jose Rojas, would give
any details of what kind of debt reworking they were thinking of.
But Ms. de la Puente said that if any proposal was made to revamp
Venezuela's $21.1 billion in foreign debt, it would be ``market
driven,'' adding that there would be no ``involuntary
restructuring.'' She said it was possible to approach investors
with a deal allowing Venezuela to swap current debt for new bonds.
``We are waiting for the right opportunity, a good opportunity to
do it,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern about the political and economic future of
Venezuela has left its debt prices at levels just above those for
Ecuador and Russia. The Russians have effectively defaulted, and
Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that
would avoid a Brady bond default. Brady bonds, which are named for
Nicholas F. Brady, a former treasury secretary, were designed as a
way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to
many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in
the early 1980s. The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more
attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and
came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $96 million in interest
and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday, right
in the middle of the International Monetary Fund's semiannual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current
Brady bonds, although there have been reports that future oil
revenue may be used as collateral. Emerging-market analysts do not
think debt restructuring will be easy for Ecuador. And some say it
will not be able to meet the requirements of an IMF economic
program, which is a prerequisite for more international aid.
