	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A center-left party on Friday endorsed
a former coup leader's bid to become Venezuela's next president, a
move that could soften the candidate's image and attract young
voters.
	   Members of the Movement to Socialism, known by its Spanish
initials MAS, voted overwhelmingly during their national convention
to support former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who leads presidential
polls six years after trying unsuccessfully to overthrow
Venezuela's popularly elected leader.
	   The debate over whether to endorse Chavez has uncovered rifts
between the party's young leaders and the older generation that
founded it. On Thursday, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff, a MAS
founder, criticized Chavez and said his populist policies would
push Venezuela ``back into the past.''
	   So far, the December presidential race is dominated by Chavez
and former Miss Universe Irene Saez, the popular mayor of a Caracas
municipality.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan court sentenced one man to 25
years in prison and another to five years for leading a village mob
that lynched a woman suspected of stealing a child.
	   The crowd killed Maria del Carmen Azucena Gonzalez in March 1997
in the village San Raymundo, 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of
the capital. The mob believed Azucena and another woman had stolen
a child, a charge Azucena repeatedly denied.
	   Villagers in rural Guatemala have become increasingly violent in
dealing with child-stealing rumors and crime in general. This year,
14 Guatemalans have been lynched, according to the private Mutual
Support Group.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Angry growers dumped tons of
green bananas at the entrances to government buildings Friday to
protest a port workers strike.
	   Berard Capgras told the Caraibes International radio station
that the fruit was part of the tons of bananas that producers have
lost since some employees went on strike recently at the
Fort-de-France harbor.
	   Capgras said the banana producers are desperate.
	   Dock workers went on strike in support of workers at a banana
farm in the southern town of Francois on this Caribbean island,
which is part of France. More than 4,000 tons of bananas destined
for France and other parts of Europe were left on the docks.
	   Some residents took advantage of the protest by hauling away as
many bananas as they could carry before cleaning companies moved in
to remove the fruit.
