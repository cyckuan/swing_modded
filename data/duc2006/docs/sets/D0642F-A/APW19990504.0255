<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Struggle Off the Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans and Cubans traded high-fives and  
handshakes on baseball diamonds in Baltimore and Havana. But in the 
diplomatic arena, it's hardball of another sort. 
</P>
<P>
	The friendly sports competition was on display when the Orioles  
played a Cuban all-star team Monday night, and five weeks ago when 
the two squared off in Cuba, with Baltimore winning 3-2 in 11 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a case of ``Baseball Si, Politics No.'' That's in marked  
contrast to the four-decade-old U.S.-Cuba government feud. 
</P>
<P>
	A case in point is the recently concluded spring session of the  
53-member U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the United States and Cuba engage in long-distance  
verbal volleying. In Geneva, however, it was a close-quarter 
diplomatic battle over a U.S.-backed resolution criticizing Cuba's 
human rights policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution expressed concern at the ``continued violation of  
human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba, such as freedom of 
expression, association and assembly and rights associated with the 
administration of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, it seemed an unequal struggle, involving the  
world's richest and most powerful country and a small poor neighbor 
that sticks by an old-style communist system widely discredited 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission takes up an anti-Cuba resolution each year,  
usually introduced by the United States. This year, Cuba was tossed 
a diplomatic curve ball when two former communist allies of Cuba -- 
the Czech Republic and Poland -- introduced it. 
</P>
<P>
	A wrathful Cuban delegation derided the Czechs and Poles, saying  
they were ``doing the dirty work of the United States.'' Carlos 
Lage, one of President Fidel Castro's most trusted lieutenants, set 
the tone, insisting it was unseemly for the United States to pass 
judgment on Cuba's human rights situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lage contended nearly 1 million Americans are homeless, 43  
million have no health insurance and 20 percent are functional 
illiterates. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, he asked: ``Where, in Cuba, are the illiterates,  
the children without schools and the teachers without classrooms? 
Where is there a single citizen without health care coverage?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He derided U.S. policies toward Cuba, including an economic  
embargo, as ``criminal, failed and ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the embargo, which was eased earlier this year to allow  
more regulated sales of food and pesticides, elicits a measure of 
sympathy for Cuba internationally. Many countries sense that 
American hostility toward the island has contributed to the 
rigidity of Cuba's internal policies. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one reason some countries close ranks behind Cuba each  
year on the anti-Cuba resolution. In 1998, it was defeated 19-16, 
with 18 abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left nothing to  
chance. She telephoned at least five Latin American foreign 
ministers seeking support for the resolution. The day of the vote, 
her top aides lobbied into the early hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an avowed admirer of Castro,  
also worked the phones, urging his Latin American colleagues to 
vote ``no.'' In response, the State Department's top aide for 
economic affairs, Alan Larson, abruptly canceled long-planned 
economic consultations in Caracas. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro himself was busy lobbying. He requested a week's  
postponement in the Geneva vote so he could do some arm twisting at 
a Caribbean regional summit in the Dominican Republic in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most controversial bid for support occurred when El  
Salvador agreed to abstain from the vote after Cuba promised to 
commute the death sentences of two Salvadorans convicted in 1997 
hotel bombings in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem for Cuba, however, was the conviction of four  
dissidents who were sentenced in March to prison terms of 3 1/2 to 5 
years. Cuba said the four were guilty of ``incitement to 
sedition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cuba had a new law imposing sentences of up to 20 years on  
Cubans found to be cooperating with U.S. attempts to promote a 
transition to democracy in Cuba. Cuba's critics saw the law as 
punishment for independent thinkers. Cuba says it is merely an 
attempt to punish those who collaborate with the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks of jockeying, the resolution passed April 23 on  
a vote of 21-20, with 12 abstentions. When the tally was announced, 
one Cuban delegate wept. 
</P>
<P>
	For Cuba, some of the sting from that vote may have been eased  
by the outcome Monday night in Baltimore: Cuba 12, Orioles 6.
