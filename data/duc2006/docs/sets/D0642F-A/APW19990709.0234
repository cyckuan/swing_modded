	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Colombia's trade minister should have  
minded her own business when she criticized Venezuelan trade 
policy, her Venezuelan counterpart said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian minister, Martha Lucia Ramirez, this week  
criticized a Venezuelan law requiring Colombian truck drivers to 
hand their cargo over Venezuelan drivers at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Caracas daily El Nacional, she said  
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ``talks about integration, but the 
measures applied by some of his officials are just the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's comments were an ``undue interference in the internal  
affairs of the country,'' Venezuelan Trade Minister Gustavo Marquez 
said in a radio interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela said the law was necessary because its drivers were at  
a disadvantage. Few Venezuelan drivers venture into Colombia 
because of the presence of leftist rebels and paramilitary squads.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A group representing 29,000  
public school teachers announced a series of strikes Friday to 
demand the government grant them a 30 percent salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Rivera, secretary-general of the Association of  
Salvadoran Educators, said the strikes would take place Tuesday in 
all 14 of the country's provinces as well as on July 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries now range between $345 and $505 per month, according to  
the Salvadoran education ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Education minister Evelyn Jacir de Lovo has dismissed the idea  
of salary increases, instead saying she would institute incentives 
to reward the best teachers starting next year.
