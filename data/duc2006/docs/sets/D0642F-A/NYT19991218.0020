   The torrential floods and mudslides sweeping away shantytowns in
Caracas this week were inevitably compared to Wednesday's
overwhelming vote for a new constitution that President Hugo Chavez
sold to voters as a democratic tide to obliterate Venezuela's
corrupt political system.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, with his mixture of democracy and demagoguery, raises
crucial questions not only about the future of oil-rich Venezuela
but about other corrupt and mismanaged countries in Latin America
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to patriotism, religious symbols, and revolutionary
rhetoric, Chavez persuaded 72 percent of voters to approve his new
constitution. Venezuelans assented to the radical revision of
institutions Chavez calls a ``peaceful revolution'' because they
were disgusted with the old order.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their country's oil wealth, four-fifths of Venezuelans
are living in poverty. Their political parties and courts had
become notoriously corrupt. The combination of poverty, egregious
inequality, and a blatantly rigged system prepared the way for
Chavez and his promises to sweep away all the old rotten
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with their new constitution, Venezuelans have voted for the
possibility of an elected dictatorship. Chavez himself will be able
to run for two six-year terms. The army will be released from
civilian control and will become a base of political power, the
equivalent of a ruling party. Hundreds of new judges and new court
officers will be appointed. The old Senate will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial test for this new order will not be political,
however, but economic. In the year since Chavez took office, there
has been a massive flight of capital from Venezuela _ nearly $4
billion. This represents a telling vote of no confidence in the
statist economic programs Chavez has tried to pursue with funds
from rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez may be able to charm voters with his invocations of Simon
Bolivar, but markets cannot be charmed by anything other than sound
fiscal and monetary policies. Sooner or later, Chavez will have to
do what it takes to reverse the flight of capital. In the meantime,
democracy is the loser.
