	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ No smoking in enclosed public
places except in designated areas. No tobacco advertising. Even ads
for non-tobacco products would not be allowed to show people
smoking cigarettes.
	   Such is life in South Africa envisioned by one of the world's
strictest anti-smoking bills, which parliament's lower house
approved on Wednesday.
	   Parliament's upper house has already passed the bill proposed by
President Nelson Mandela's health minister. It must now reconsider
it due to some last-minute amendments. Final passage appeared
assured.
	   ``It is just a formality,'' said one dejected lawmaker, Ruth
Rabinowitz of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which voted against the
bill.
	   But tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to
mount a constitutional challenge to the bill, which could delay it
becoming law or perhaps kill it altogether. Opponents say the bill
infringes individual and free-trade rights.
	   All but one of the opposition parties in the National Assembly
opposed the bill on Wednesday, but the ruling African National
Congress' hefty majority ensured a victory. It was approved by 213
votes to 106.
	   ``Fundamental fanatacism has won the day,'' rued the National
Party, which ruled under apartheid and whose last president, F.W.
de Klerk, was a chain smoker.
	   Although the two sides remained deeply divided, the day had its
light moments.
	   ANC lawmaker Kader Asmal evoked laughter when he spoke in
support of the bill, saying it didn't ban smoking altogether but
just ``privatized pleasure.''
	   Asmal smoked for 50 years until giving up under a doctor's
orders earlier this year.
	   When the house speaker announced absent lawmakers would be given
five minutes to appear for the vote, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
asked whether the time could be used for a smoke break.
	   Manuel is not known to be a smoker, and he did not join a
handful of lawmakers who hurried out of the chamber to sneak a
quick puff below a nearby flight of stairs.
	   Parliament banned smoking in most public areas of the building,
including the area below the stairs, several months ago.
	   During debate on Tuesday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma
declared ``the social cost of continued indulgence in the
destructive habit of smoking is prohibitively high.''
	   The bill outlaws smoking in enclosed public places like train
stations and shopping malls and in the workplace.
	   It provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate
facilities are created for those desperate for a puff. Bars and
restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the
ban.
	   The planned law bans all tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
Even ads for products such as drinks and clothes would be banned
from showing people smoking.
	   The maximum fine for smoking at work or in public places would
be 200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines
of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
	   Cigarette advertisements in South Africa on billboards and the
print media already must prominently display such warnings as
``DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU,'' or ``DANGER: SMOKING CAUSES
CANCER.''
	   The tobacco industry, advertising groups and some unions oppose
the bill and are vowing a fight.
