	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in Thailand have announced they
will start enforcing a law banning smoking in public places, Thai
newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Assistant city police commissioner Maj. Jongrak Juthanon
announced the policy after meeting the head of the government's
anti-smoking body, Dr. Waraporn Pumisawat, who complained that the
ban was not being enforced, the newspaper The Nation reported.
	   The Non-smokers' Health Protection Act and the Tobacco Products
Control Act came into effect earlier this year. They impose fines
of 2,000-20,000 baht (dlrs 50-dlrs 500) for smoking in such places
as government offices, buses, malls, supermarkets, barbershops,
tailor shops, beauty salons and drug stores.
	   Restaurateurs who do not arrange non-smoking areas in their
restaurants will also be fined. said the Bangkok Post.
	   Police Maj. Jongrak was quoted as saying that police initially
would apply light penalties against offenders in an effort to raise
public awareness.
