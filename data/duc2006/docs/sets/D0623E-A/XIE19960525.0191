<HEADLINE> Cigarette Industry Puffed Out As Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's cigarette industry appears
to be losing its puff for the first time ever, with sales and
production falling in the first four months of this year, the
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide anti-smoking campaigns and rising production costs
have taken their toll on the industry, which fuels the habits of
over 300 million smokers.
</P>
<P>
The industry, boasting nearly 180 cigarette factories, churned
out 56.66 million cigarettes in the first four months of this
year, an 1.7 per cent drop from 57.625 million in the same period
last year, according to the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau(STMB).
</P>
<P>
A total of 54.21 million cigarettes were sold, down 2.3 percent
from the 55.465 million sold last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a normal situation, because usually cigarettes see
brisk sales prior to the Spring Festival. More often than not, the
sales drops markedly afterwards," an STMB official said.
</P>
<P>
"But the influence of the smoking ban in public places in 26
cities throughout the country cannot be ruled out," the official
added.
</P>
<P>
"Although we expect an upturn in the sales and production in
the second half of this year, the outlook is not rosy," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the national anti-smoking movements, STMB has
slashed its planned output to 1,712.5 billion cigarettes this
year, down from the actual production of 1,736 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
However, as one of the country's largest tax generators, the
industry turned in 25.5 billion yuan (three billion US dollars) in
profits and taxes, a marked 16 percent rise over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the rise in profits to the increased
production of famous-brand cigarettes and those with filter-tips,
which sell for a higher price.
</P>
<P>
Output of as many as 50 famous-brands has topped 17.34 million
over the first four months, accounting for 30 percent of total
volume, up 6.7 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, cost hikes in raw materials like tobacco, filter
tips, paper, and packaging as well as rise in prices of water and
electricity, has trimmed at least three billion yuan off the
expected revenue for the period," he said.
