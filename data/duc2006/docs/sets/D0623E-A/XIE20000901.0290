<HEADLINE> Smoking Ban Approved by Italian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lighting up in public and private
indoor areas throughout Italy could draw hefty fines under a
smoking ban that was formally approved Friday by Italy's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping ban allows for designated smoking zones in
ventilated areas, but calls for stiff fines against those who
violate the ban.
</P>
<P>
All publicly and privately owned indoor places open to the
public are covered by the bill, including bars, restaurants,
prisons and police stations.
</P>
<P>
Owners, managers and designated "smoke-busters" who fail to
apply the norms are also subject to fines though the cabinet
Friday agreed to reduce the penalty.
</P>
<P>
The proposed fines would range from 100,000-300,000 lire (about
50-150 U.S. dollars) for anyone who lights up.
</P>
<P>
The ban was drafted by Italian Health Minister Umberto Veronesi
and previously approved on first reading by the cabinet and by the
State-Region Conference, and it will go into effect after being
upheld by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Veronesi, one of Europe's leading cancer specialists, has
announced a crusade against smoking, saying that too many Italians
still die of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people, or 24.5 percent of the
population, in Italy smoke cigarettes though figures compiled by
the national statistics bureau Istat show that the percentage of
smokers nationwide has fallen by nearly 1 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to Veronesi, the proceeds from the fines will be used
to fund anti-smoking campaigns, Veronese said.
