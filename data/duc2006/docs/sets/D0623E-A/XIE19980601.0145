<HEADLINE> Jordan Reports Heavy Loss by Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, where one in four smokes, has
complained of a great loss caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Anti-Smoking Society President Mohammad Shreim told a
seminar Sunday that smoking costs Jordan at least 166 million
Jordanian dinars (about 234 million U.S. dollars) a year in
economic and public health losses.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held to mark the International Anti-Smoking Day.
</P>
<P>
The figure was far more than the sum of revenues collected from
domestic cigarette production and imports, Shreim was quoted by
the semi-official Jordan Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's cigarette imports stand at 90 million dinars (about
127 million dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
Smokers in Jordan, accounting for nearly one-fourth of its 4.5
million inhabitants, spend 134 million dinars (about 190 million
dollars) on cigarettes every year, Shreim said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ali Khan, who represents the World Health Organization
at the seminar, said that Jordan has also found common grounds
with other Middle East countries in the fact that the majority of
its youths have slid into smoking.
</P>
<P>
The fact predicted a worse picture of economic and public
health situation for the kingdom in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has enacted law banning smoking in public places, but
many people ignore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, smuggling of foreign-made cigarettes is rampant in
the country.
