NEW YORK: the law.

	   GERMANY: Health-conscious Germans are drinking less beer and
eating leaner meat, but they still like their cigarettes. Big ``No
Smoking'' signs hang at subway entrances in Berlin, but,
recognizing the inevitable, there are ashtrays on the platforms. In
February, parliament easily defeated the first attempt to regulate
smoking nationwide.
	   GREECE: One would never know it, but smoking is actually
forbidden in public places in Greece _ where 45 percent of adults
smoke _ and it has been for years. It is banned on all public
transport (1952), in closed public spaces (1980), on domestic
flights (1990) and in health-care facilities (1993). ``Regardless,
some people abuse it,'' says Pantelis Vekios of the Health
Ministry. ``It happens a lot in Greece. If your boss smokes and you
can't say anything to him because he'll fire you, what can you
do?''
	   ISRAEL: By and large, Israel has followed the United States'
lead in enacting bans, but some time later. But the head of Israel
radio, Amnon Nadav, refused to allow government inspectors into his
building after some of his staff complained about the
round-the-clock stench of nicotine.
	   ITALY: Cigarette smoke wafts from the Coliseum in Rome,
cigarette butts litter the Forum. You've come to Rome to see the
sights, but the country's anti-smoking laws are, in general,
blowing a lot of smoke. Two years ago, the government banned
smoking in private businesses serving the public and ordered
government agencies to enforce the prohibitions. Still, banks put
up ``No-Smoking'' signs just a few feet from ... ashtrays. Ditto
for some hospital waiting rooms.
	   JAPAN: In Tokyo, restaurant patrons eat in a fog of tobacco
smoke, a blue haze hangs over coffeehouses and workplaces reek of
cigarettes. Restrictions are slowly springing up. Smokers are
limited to special parts of train platforms, for example, and small
no-smoking sections are becoming more common in family style
eateries.
	   MEXICO: If it isn't a smoker's paradise, it's only because the
cigarettes are so bad. It's hard to walk a block in Mexico City
without finding someone hawking smokes such as Marlboros or
Delicados (unfiltered ``Delicate Ones''). The only places with
effective bans are the movie theater, subway and public buses.
	   NETHERLANDS: You can walk into a so-called ``coffeehouse'' and
smoke marijuana or hashish without fear of arrest, so puffing on
mere tobacco is tame stuff. There are no ``smoker segregation''
laws, but change is in the air. More companies are sending
employees outside to smoke, and this year KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
banned smoking on all flights.
	   PORTUGAL: When entering an elevator in Lisbon, don't worry if
the ashtray is full. You can stub out your cigarette on the floor
like those before you. Such occurrences are much rarer than they
once were, but the smoke still blows thick in Portugal _ especially
in bars and restaurants.
	   RUSSIA: Moscow has a few designated no-smoking areas, but
everywhere else people smoke as they please. State officials light
up in the corridors of government buildings, school teachers puff
away in lounges and school stairwells, restaurants allow smoking in
the dining rooms. Even in clinics and hospitals, there is little
apparent concern for the dangers of smoking. But smokers may be
fined if they light up on a city bus or subway.
	   SINGAPORE: Soon smokers will have nowhere to hide. It's still
safe to light up in a bar, disco, karaoke lounge and in the great
outdoors. But if you are on line for a bus or a taxi with more than
two other people, you'd better stub out that butt fast.
	   All public areas, air conditioned shopping centers and shops,
offices, schools, private clubs, taxis, buses and public toilets in
Singapore are designated smoke-free. Smoking is also barred in
underground pedestrian walkways and any lines of two or more
people.
	   The maximum fine for selling tobacco to anyone under 18 is 5,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,000) for the first offense, and 10,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,000) for subsequent offenses. Last year,
a court sentenced a 16-year-old boy to two years in juvenile
detention for repeated underage smoking.
	   But after 28 years of increasingly restrictive laws, about 18
percent of the population still smokes.
	   SPAIN: When dining out in Madrid, don't worry about fighting for
a seat in the no-smoking section because there's no such thing.
Just hold your breath and chew fast. In other public places, such
as stores and public transport, smoking is banned under law but
some people light up anyway. In government buildings, smoking is
prohibited only in ones that deal directly with the public.
	   TURKEY: A year after a law banned smoking in public offices,
hospitals, buses and airports, people are still said to ``smoke
like a Turk.'' Cinema lobbies and waiting rooms seem less hazy
these days, with the nonsmoking minority policing the ban. Still,
ashtrays remain under no-smoking signs to collect the butts of
violators, who dare to face a 10 million turkish lira (dlrs 32)
fine.
	   UNITED KINGDOM: Pity the smoker who doesn't drink, as pubs
remain a safe haven. Otherwise, British smokers increasingly are
relegated to the sidewalk or the parking lot, largely at the
initiative of employers, and smoking is banned in many public
places including subways and trains. The government has set a
target of reducing cigarette consumption by 40 percent by the year
2000.
	   VENEZUELA: It's pretty much OK to smoke anywhere you want in
Caracas and most other cities, with a few exceptions, such as
hospitals and the Health Ministry. Upscale restaurants are
beginning to create no-smoking sections, and there's a de facto ban
on overcrowded buses because passengers are already irritated by
exhaust fumes from traffic jams.
