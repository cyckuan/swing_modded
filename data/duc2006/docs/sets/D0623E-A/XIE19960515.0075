<HEADLINE> Beijing Bans Smoking in Public Places (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Guihua failed to find a single
smoker to fine in a big Beijing department store, even though she
searched among the bustle of shoppers for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Sun was happy about her work anyway, saying: "It shows that
almost all people know about the regulation and observe it."
</P>
<P>
The regulation she was referring to, which took effect today,
bans smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
To enforce it and to fine offenders, a small army of more than
80,000 people like Sun was sent to department stores, hospitals,
schools, railway stations, and other public places.
</P>
<P>
The air in packed waiting rooms at the Beijing Railway Station
used to be filled with smoke, but now look cleaner and smell
better.
</P>
<P>
"I have to go outside to take a cigarette because of the 'no
smoking' signs everywhere," a traveller waiting for his train
said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
That sign and others have been placed in easy-to-see locations
on major streets, in busy shopping areas, and in public places
around the city, for several months.
</P>
<P>
There were even people handing out millions of pamphlets on the
street to make people aware of the adverse effects of smoking and
advising them to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved because I will no longer be surrounded by
clouds of cigarette smoke in offices and meeting rooms," said a
passer-by who stopped at one information site on Chang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
A government office worker was another beneficiary of the
massive anti-smoking drive: "I don't need to clean ash trays full
of cigarette butts from now on, because nobody will use them
anymore," she remarked while cleaning up a meeting room.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of smoking less and trying to quit," Tian Yong,
vice president of the Beijing No. 4 Middle School and a veteran of
26 years of smoking, told Xinhua. He said he thinks stopping
teachers from smoking at school is vital to providing a healthy
example for students.
