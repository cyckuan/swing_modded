<HEADLINE> Diverse Reactions to New Anti-Smoking Law in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The first day of the
introduction of the law which bans smoking in California's bars
and nightclubs ended with mixed reactions from the public.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-smoking law, the strongest in the United States,
went into effect in the small hours on January 1, 1998. The ban
stems from California's indoor workplace smoking prohibition that
started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, bar owners will be fined up to 100
U.S. dollars for the first offense and 7,000 dollars for the
second violation.
</P>
<P>
Reporters from local newspapers based in Los Angeles, San
Diego, San Francisco and other cities spent much time in New
Year's Day in bars which were packed with patrons to interview
with smokers, non-smokers, bar owners and policemen.
</P>
<P>
In some bars, smokers went right on smoking despite waitresses
had confiscated ashtrays at midnight. But in other bars, customers
got in their last puffs before midnight, and then the smoke
cleared.
</P>
<P>
An organization called Californians for Smokers' Rights issued
a statement on Thursday, calling for the repeal of the law.
</P>
<P>
The organization argued, "the law deprives smokers of the right
to consume a legal product within a private establishment."
</P>
<P>
But other smokers seem not so assured. Although complaining and
cursing the law, they smoked out of the bars. Some people also
said that they would quit smoking because of the new law.
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency urged
residents to embrace the law and report violations.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking activists were confident that people will become
accustomed to the law.
</P>
<P>
However, owners of bars and restaurants argued that the ban
would severely hurt their business.
</P>
<P>
California's Health Department hoped that most bar owners and
patrons would eventually comply with the new law.
