<HEADLINE> Beijing Taking Lead in Banning Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing legislators have passed a
smoking ban, stepping to the forefront of keeping tobacco out of
offices.
</P>
<P>
The ban is scheduled to take effect next Wednesday in public
places such as hospitals, schools, cinemas, department stores, and
public conveyances.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 "no-smoking" signs have been placed inside
buildings of the Municipal People's Congress, the local
legislative body, since it passed the ban last December.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes were banned from all offices and meeting rooms of
the MPC as soon as it published news of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Buildings of the municipal government and the Municipal
Communist Party Committee have also become smoke-free areas,
meaning that smokers are allowed to satisfy their craving only in
designated smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
The city has asked all government office workers to set an
example in the citywide anti-smoking drive, which is expected to
be a long and trying time for millions of smokers.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 volunteers will be on duty in no-smoking areas
from next week to levy a ten-yuan (a little more than one US
dollar) fine on those who break the rules.
