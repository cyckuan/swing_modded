<HEADLINE> Whitman vetoes bills designed to crack down on underage smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday snuffed out a bill
that would have slapped fines on teens who smoke in public, suggesting it could
have done more harm than good.
<P>
	   The governor also vetoed a bill that would have gone after underage drinkers
in private homes, saying it would have taken the long arm of state government
"too far into private family conduct."
</P>
<P>
	   Both bills were pushed by lawmakers who said more needs to be done to curb
teen smoking and drinking. In both cases, Whitman essentially said: Good idea,
but not the best plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Because both bills passed in the waning days of the 208th Legislature,
Whitman's vetoes stand. Lawmakers can introduce the bills again during the
current two-year session.
</P>
<P>
	   The smoking bill, A-2254, would have forbidden underage smokers from
possessing cigarettes in public places such as streets, schools, parks and
shopping centers. Underage smokers caught puffing in public or possessing
tobacco products could have been hit with a $25 fine for first-time offenders.
The fine would have been suspended, however, until a minor attended a class that
teaches why smoking is bad. Repeat offenders would have been ordered to perform
up to 15 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors said the bill was intended to send a strong message about smoking
to teens. However, anti-smoking groups opposed the bill, saying no studies show
such a crackdown actually cuts down on youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said in her veto message that anti-smoking groups told her "this is
not the most effective or efficient use of public resources to combat smoking by
young people."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also said she worried that the bill "may inadvertently harm
community policing efforts aimed at building positive relationships between
police and juveniles, and will draw youths into the municipal court system."
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, a sponsor of the bipartisan bill, said
he believed it was killed "by misinformation."
</P>
<P>
	   "Every year New Jersey continues to delay measures that keep young people
away from tobacco, another 36,000 kids will begin smoking," Suliga said.
"Obviously, the steps that have been undertaken in reducing tobacco's appeal to
youngsters have not had much impact. The primary purpose of my bill was to break
outside the bounds of traditional youth tobacco control programs and educate
kids on the immediate consequences of smoking."
</P>
<P>
	   Suliga said some police chiefs told him the bill would not harm community
police efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Downs, director of NJ Breathes, an anti-smoking group, said the bill's
"unintended effect" would have been to send the message that tobacco use is
acceptable for those who turn 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no research that says this approach was going to work," said
Downs. "We'd rather see the money go to good tobacco control policies."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also vetoed S-1617, which lawmakers said would crack down on
underage drinkers who imbibe in private homes. Underage drinking is already
prohibited in public places, and sponsors said this bill would solve a problem
they say is particularly acute during summers at the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor, however, said the bill could go too far.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am concerned that the prohibitions could be construed to apply to
situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol
under the watchful eye of an adult family member, such as a grandparent,"
Whitman said. "Application of this bill in such situations may intrude too far
into private family conduct."
