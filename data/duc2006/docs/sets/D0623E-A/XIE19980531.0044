<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 79 provinces and cities
in China have formulated regulations banning smoking in public
places, a senior Chinese health official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, minister of Health, made the announcement in a
written speech marking the 11th "World No Tobacco Day", which
falls on today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that provinces and cities which have formulated
smoking-ban regulations include the provinces of Shanxi, Jilin,
Shandong, Jiangxi and Fujian, the municipalities of Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, and 70 provincial capitals such
as Guangzhou and Wuhan, as well as medium- and small-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
China has about 320 million smokers. A survey shows that over
90 percent of smokers smoke in public places.
</P>
<P>
Since smoking in a public place causes serious secondary
smoking and has a bad impact on youngsters, China has taken the ban
on smoking in public places as a key part of the ban on smoking in
public places in its anti-smoking effort.
</P>
<P>
A regulation banning smoking in public transport means and
waiting areas was enacted in last May.
</P>
<P>
However, these "smoking-control" cities only account for
one-eighth of all the country's cities, according to an official
with the National Committee for Patriotic Health campaign (NCPHC),
who described it as a "long-term and arduous" task to promote work
in this regard in all cities.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ming with the NCPHC said that the rapid development of the
country's tobacco industry in recent years has resulted in a
substantial increase in the number of smokers.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the ratio of adolescent and youth smokers
in the age group of 15-25 increased by six percentage points in
1996 over 1984, and the average age for smoking the first
cigarette moved to 19.7 from 22.4.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu pointed out, China's efforts to control smoking is
gaining increasing support from both smokers and non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, 84 percent of the smokers and 89 percent
of the non-smokers have become aware of the hazard caused by
smoking to health. Meanwhile, 74 percent of the correspondents
support government's effort to ban smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Committee for Patriotic Health Campaign
awarded today a group of "smoking-free" schools and a group of
educators who have done a good job in promoting smoking-control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Activities to publicize the knowledge that smoking is hazardous
 to health and keeping youngsters away from cigarettes were also
conducted in busy commercial districts in the Chinese capital
today.
