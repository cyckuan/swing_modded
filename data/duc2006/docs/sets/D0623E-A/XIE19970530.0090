<HEADLINE> 71 Cities, 3 Provinces Ban Smoking in Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smoking in public has
been outlawed in 71 major Chinese cities and three provinces,
according the Chinese Association on Smoking &AMP; Health.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the number of cities and province banning smoking
at public places will go higher soon because the whole country is
promoting an anti-smoking drive," Han Changlin, vice-president of
the association, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The smoking bans of these places mainly cover public
transportation facilities, schools, cinemas, theaters, meeting
halls, hospitals, department stores, museums, stadiums, and so on.
</P>
<P>
Many big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing municipalities, and Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an and other
cities took similar measures after Changzhi of north China's
Shanxi Province initiated the no-smoking law in November, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The local legislative bodies passed regulations, or city
governments published orders, to prohibit tobacco use in public.
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, and Shandong also enacted the
smoking bans.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent to step up anti-smoking measures, since smoking
and second-hand smoking have become a serious public health hazard
in China," Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Health officials and experts said to ban smoking in public
places should play a leading role in the anti-tobacco campaign in
the country.
</P>
<P>
China has some 350 million smokers and more than 400 million
passive smokers, and the rate of teenage smoking is still on rise.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of lung cancer cases resulted from smoking,
according to a study conducted by the Cancer Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Lung cancer is the
number one cancer killer in Chinese cities with a population of
more than one million,
</P>
<P>
"Death toll related to tobacco use will climb to two million
annually by the year 2020, from some 500,000 at present, if we
don't take actions immediately," Minister Chen warned.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities in charge of health and transportation have
jointly prohibited tobacco from passenger trains, ships, planes,
buses, subways, taxi cabs, ferry boats, cable cars, and waiting
rooms at railway stations, airports, and seaports, from May 1.
</P>
<P>
The action is a strong support to the country's endevours to
create a clean and no-smoking environment for the Chinese people,
the health officials said.
