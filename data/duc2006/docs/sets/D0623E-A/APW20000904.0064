<HEADLINE> Ruling adds caution to anti-smoking laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A handful of New Jersey towns considering
developing local smoking bans may have second thoughts after last
week's court ruling striking down Princeton's broad anti-smoking
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will certainly put a damper on and intimidate the
(communities considering new local smoking restrictions) from
moving ahead,'' Regina Carlson, executive director of the
anti-smoking nonprofit New Jersey GASP, told The Times of Trenton
for Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Bans are in place already in several towns, but none of the
existing anti-smoking ordinances are as sweeping as the one in
Princeton, which would have been the strictest in the state. It
prohibited lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces,
restricting smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors. Violators
faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 64-page ruling, Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda R.
Feinberg said the Princeton Regional Health Commission did not have
the authority to enact the ban for fire-safety purposes. The judge
also held that the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said a few New Jersey towns - including Cherry Hill and
Ocean City - had considered implementing a similar ban, but were
waiting for the outcome of the Princeton case.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City Mayor Henry Knight said the proposed anti-smoking
measure there likely will be dropped following the advice of the
city solicitor.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University law professor Robert Williams said the future
of anti-smoking laws in other towns depends on whether the decision
last Tuesday is upheld on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only one judge's decision until there's a more
authoritative decision from an appeals court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The health commission has not yet decided whether to appeal.
