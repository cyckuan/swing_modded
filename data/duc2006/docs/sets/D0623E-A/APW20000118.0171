<HEADLINE> Canada Eyes Graphic Smoke Warnings  </HEADLINE>

	   TORONTO (AP) -- Photos of diseased organs would cover up to 50 percent of
cigarette packaging under a proposal expected to be announced on Canada's
national anti-smoking day, ``Weedless Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Health Minister Alan Rock has been studying the matter for more than a year,
and persistent news reports said he would formally propose the new warning
regulations on Wednesday. A ministry spokesman refused to comment on the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the government after public hearings and other steps in the
regulatory process, the warnings would be the first anywhere to include graphic
photos of diseased organs, according to Cynthia Callard of Physicians for a
Smoke-Free Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Showing a picture of a brain that's been destroyed is a much stronger way
of getting the message across,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years. Smoking is
generally prohibited in public places such as government buildings and
auditoriums, and some areas ban smoking in bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Health warnings on cigarettes were required until the Supreme Court in 1995
struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigarette makers continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new
Tobacco Act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations
on health warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco industry has challenged other aspects of the 1997 Tobacco Act in
court, contending it amounts to a ban on cigarette advertising and therefore
infringes on free expression guaranteed by the Charter of Rights. The case is
pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturer's Council, was
quoted by The Globe and Mail newspaper as saying that the industry has been left
out of consultations on the government's health warning plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned whether the graphic images under consideration could be
reproduced on packages, and said the industry previously agreed with the
government that cigarette packages should have warnings but disagreed over what
the warnings should say and how large they should be.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, cigarette makers are required to include warning
labels on packages. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey
and Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, intend to propose legislation this year
that would require the warnings to be worded more clearly and directly, and to
include a list of all ingredients and cancer-causing agents in cigarettes,
Lautenberg's office said Wednesday.
