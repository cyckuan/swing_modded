JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Smokers across South Africa will
soon be hounded out of many public places because a tough clamp-down
on smoking in shops and banks will be imposed, Saturday Star paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The controls, in terms of amendments to South Africa's tobacco
laws, are due to be tabled in parliament shortly.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies are considering whether to challenge the new law
in the Constitutional Court, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The draconian measures against smoking in public are in addition to
the proposed ban on tobacco advertisements and sports sponsorship by
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
The new law will enable local authorities to ban smoking in public
places and to designate areas where smoking is allowed, a health
spokesman of the Gauteng province was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, the economic powerhouse of South Africa, is gearing itself
for the anti-smoking move, with regulations in the pipeline and ready
to be implemented when the new law is promulgated, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Public places are defined as gyms, banks, hotels, libraries, post
offices, schools, creches, shopping malls, retail stores, theaters,
cinemas and stadiums.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will also see a ban on smoking in municipal
buildings and on public transport.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show that one in three adult South Africans
smoked, and the habit is growing among teenagers, at whom much of the
tobacco advertising was aimed.
</P>
<P>
Surveys also show that most South Africans support the state's
proposal to ban smoking in public and regulate tobacco advertisement.
