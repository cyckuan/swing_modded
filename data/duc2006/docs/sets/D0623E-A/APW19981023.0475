 &UR; Anti-smoking bill clears key hurdle in South Africa &QL;

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A drastic anti-smoking bill
cleared a key legislative hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving
the way for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and
public places.
	   A health committee approved the bill that has been fiercely
opposed by the tobacco industry, media and advertising groups and
some unions.
	   The planned law, one of the toughest in the world, bans all
tobacco advertising.
	   It outlaws smoking in public and the workplace, but provides
exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are
created for workers desperate for a puff.
	   Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would
escape the ban, said committee member Ruth Rabinowitz.
	   A lawmaker with the minority Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party, Rabinowitz said she abstained from voting because her party
had not taken a position on the bill.
	   But she said she personally considers the bill too extreme.
	   ``Its intentions are good, but it is not good law making,'' she
said ``Some of it is far too draconian.''
	   Opposition lawmakers oppose the bill, but the ruling African
National Congress' overwhelming majority guarantees passage of its
bills through all committees.
	   Tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount
a constitutional challenge to the law, which is expected to be
passed by full Parliament early next month.
	   The panel approved minor amendments to lighten the bill, such as
granting permission for tobacco logos to be displayed on clothing.
	   But it tightened other areas, banning all advertising from
showing tobacco use, even if the product is not tobacco related.
	   The top fine for smoking at work or in public places would be
200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines of
up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
