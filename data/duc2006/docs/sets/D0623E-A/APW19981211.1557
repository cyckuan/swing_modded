	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers on the go are always a step ahead in
plotting when and where they can get that next nicotine fix.
	   On a day-trip with the kids in the back of the car and a wife
with an attitude about second-hand smoke, they finesse with
frequent pit stops blamed on the bladder.
	   But deep dread sets in when boarding a U.S. airliner and some
foreign carriers, knowing there is no finesse.
	   That's a given. But what is less defined are the anti-smoking
laws in the countries you plan to visit. They vary greatly and
often are winked at.
	   Authorities in Singapore are determined to make the city-state
the world's first smoke-free nation. To that end, smokers can be
slapped with a dlrs 600 fine just for lighting up while waiting in
line for a bus or taxi.
	   On the other hand, smokers in Japan are allowed for the most
part to light up when and where they please. Could that be because
the powerful Ministry of Finance owns two-thirds of the stock in
Japan Tobacco, which controls nearly 80 percent of the cigarette
market?
	   There's also a smoker-friendly atmosphere in Egypt, where the
government owns the country's biggest cigarette company.
	   A reporter who was covering Israel's Knesset (parliament) when
it passed a law banning smoking in elevators, among other public
places, recalls riding an elevator with the minister of police,
Haim Bar-Lev, holding a lighted cigar.
	   ``How can you smoke in the elevator?'' the reporter asked.
``Shouldn't you be setting an example of compliance with the new
law?''
	   Haim Bar-Lev smiled and replied: ``The law says I mustn't smoke
in the elevator. It doesn't say I mustn't hold my cigar in the
elevator.'' He later died of cancer while ambassador in Moscow.
	   A newswoman in a small restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was
sitting beneath a ``No Fumar'' sign. She asked the waiter if there
was someplace else she could smoke.
	   ``The waiter promptly lifted the sign off the wall and urged me
to go ahead and smoke,'' she says. ``There weren't any other
customers, so I did.''
	   In Montreal, once a smokers' haven, there's a move afoot to
restrict smoking in restaurants and most public places. That
bothers Frank Valente, a restaurateur who fears business will
suffer.
	   ``The nonsmoker will have a coffee,'' he says, ``The smoker will
have three cognacs and two coffees, then he'll have a bottle of
wine with dinner.''
	   For the benefit of smokers _ and nonsmokers _ who travel, we
asked AP correspondents around the globe to summarize the smoking
laws where they are stationed. This is their report, with the
countries in alphabetical order:
	   AUSTRALIA: Even pubs are succumbing to creeping anti-smoke
sentiment, with bar workers' unions in Sydney suggesting that
employers should be legally liable if workers end up with lung
disease. Smoking is outlawed in most public places and offices, and
the heaps of butts at back doors and loading docks indicate
compliance.
	   BELGIUM: Enter a restaurant in Brussels and one question you
will never hear is: ``Smoking or nonsmoking?'' Belgian law bans or
curbs smoking in public places, but enforcement is sloppy,
violations rampant. Belgians are simply not bothered by
anti-smoking rules, and complaints from nonsmokers are often
treated with disdain.
	   BRAZIL: A recent ban on smoking in public buildings and on short
flights is widely ignored. Smokers routinely light up in shopping
malls and waiting rooms, and the ``No Smoking'' section in planes
often exists only in theory. Cigarette ads on TV must carry a
health warning, but often it's no more than ``Avoid smoking around
small children.'' Brazil is a major producer and exporter of
tobacco.
	   CANADA: Toronto tried to become Canada's first city to ban
smoking in bars and restaurants but backed down last year in the
face of widespread defiance. In smoker-friendly Montreal,
provincial legislation in the works would outlaw smoking in most
public places and require restaurants to allocate at least 60
percent of their seats to nonsmokers.
	   CHINA: With 320 million smokers, smoking is the closest thing
China has to a national pastime. Lighting up in the Forbidden City,
on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small
fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally
the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored.
	   DENMARK: Although smoking is banned in hospitals, public
transportation and shops, Danes can still have a puff in Copenhagen
cafes and restaurants so long as they don't bother others. Most
offices have a smoking room and, if colleagues don't mind, smokers
can light up at their desks.
	   EGYPT: Smokers puff away almost anywhere: on buses, in
elevators, next to ``No Smoking'' signs. The government regularly
announces anti-smoking drives, but it owns the biggest cigarette
company, too. Its newest brand, Toshka, is named for a vast
government plan to turn Egypt's desert into farmland _ perhaps for
growing tobacco?
	   FRANCE: Smoke-filled cafes are still pretty much the norm. But
thanks to a 1991 law, the haze is starting to clear. Smoking is
prohibited in subways, trains, airplanes, hospitals and public
places. Though some still light up in those places, it's happening
less and less. Officials at the National Committee Against Smoking
say the biggest headache remains the workplace, where it's up to
the boss to enforce the law.
