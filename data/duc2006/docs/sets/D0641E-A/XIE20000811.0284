KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner for Meteorology
Bwango Apuuli has warned of severe droughts in Uganda and East
Africa during this season, the New Vision reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Africa will have severe droughts, while southern Africa
will face floods, he said, adding that the extreme weather events
such as floods and droughts will increase in the frequency and
intensity because of global warming.
</P>
<P>
"Global warming, associated with periodic warming of the
neighboring oceans, has resulted in changes in the strength and
characteristics of the monsoon winds that bring moisture into
Uganda," Apuuli was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The global atmospheric temperature had increased due to
increase in greenhouse gases, said Apuuli, noting: "If significant
reduction in greenhouse gases is not done, the average global
temperature is predicted to raise by three degrees centigrade by
the year 2001."
</P>
<P>
Communities should be prepared to adapt to the new weather
phenomena, he said, urging the government to encourage rainwater
harvesting, supplementary irrigation and energy conservation
practices.
