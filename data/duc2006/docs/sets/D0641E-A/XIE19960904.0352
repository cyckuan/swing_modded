<HEADLINE> Global Warming Forces living Species to Move North </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An American biologist has
obtained the clearest evidence so far that global warming is
forcing living species to move toward the poles and to higher
altitudes, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Experts have long predicted that many organisms would shift
their ranges in response to climatic change. But good evidence of
such movement in response to the modest warming of the last
century has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
The clearest evidence was found by Dr. Camille Parmesan, a
researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She
drove 45,000 miles and lived in a tent for 14 months in the
summers of 1992 through 1994. She made on-the-spot survey of more
than 100 previously recorded populations of the butterfly from
Mexico to Canada and eastward to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
By comparing what she found with previous records, she
discovered a pattern of local extinctions and colonizations that
taken together, documented the northward movement of the species.
</P>
<P>
She said that the shift is surprisingly large for the
relatively small average warming of the earth's surface, about one
degree Fahrenheit, over the last century. So, she concluded that
warming is the cause of the change.
</P>
<P>
Biologists say that the warming of the earth's surface over the
last century has probably been caused by emissions of
heat-trapping waste industrial gases. They predicted that the
warming will continue most likely amounting to about 3.5 degrees
by the end of the next century if emissions are not reduced. The
predicted warming is expected to cause widespread climatic,
ecological and economic dislocation.
