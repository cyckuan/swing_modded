	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane
swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and
green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to
Mitch.
	   Clouds grew. Rain squalls massed. And Tropical Depression No. 13
would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made
it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
	   Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000
lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending
mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea.
	   Powerful hurricanes like Mitch, devastating droughts and
torrential floods have long plagued humankind.
	   But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists
meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital
warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't
effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's
undue warming.
	   The two-week summit was expected to conclude Friday with a
framework for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for
reductions in heat-trapping gases by industrialized nations by
2012.
	   Skeptics insist there's no way to predict the weather, next
week, next decade or even a century from now. Environmentalists,
too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall
global warming.
	   In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark
report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human
influence on global climate.''
	   In other words, mankind has some hand in the Earth's warming.
	   Picking up their cue from the scientific evidence, climate
negotiators in Buenos Aires say there is more cause for concern.
	   ``Every month so far this year has set a record high for global
temperatures, right on the heels of 1997, the warmest year on the
books. And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme
weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in
Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and
devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S.
climate negotiator.
	   Others reject that the globe is warming, and challenge the
consensus that unfettered burning of coal, gas and oil will harm
the Earth. As the debate continues, record amounts of gases spew
from power plants and cars.
	   New research shows that temperature changes can change more
rapidly than previously thought, says Jeff Severinghause of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
	   ``We now have evidence that at the end of the last ice age, the
climate warmed abruptly in less than 10 years,'' he said, reporting
findings from 100-pound (45-kilo) samples extracted from
Greenland's ice pack.
	   He said evidence suggests a rapid change 11,600 years ago, when
temperatures rose about 14 degrees F (8 degrees C) in a mere decade
or two. He has documented at least one other sudden shift.
	   One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R. Christy at the
University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show
significant global warming is not occuring now. He has also argued
that trying to discern patterns in ``extreme'' weather events is
misleading.
	   And hurricane forecasters doubt extreme weather events such as
Mitch show the influence of global warming.
	   ``I think it's agreed that the globe is about 1 degree
Fahrenheit warmer this century, but as far as its effect on
tropical cyclones, we haven't been able to notice any difference,''
said forecaster Brian Jarvinen at the U.S. National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
	   He said intense hurricane periods have cycled on and off roughly
every 25 years in this century. ``You had intense storms in the
1920s, 30s and 40s,'' he said, but then a milder hurricane cycle
from the 60s to the 80s.
	   Some governments warn they can't wait for a definitive answer to
why the oceans are rising.
	   Seas have risen 2 centimeters (nearly 1 inch) in the past year
in parts of the Pacific, shrinking shorelines and displacing
coastal dwellers _ all blamed on global warming.
	   The prime minister of Tuvalu said his nation of 9,600 people _
spread over nine small South Pacific atolls, has already suffered.
	   ``We are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries,'' said
Bikenibeau Paeniu. ``We are spending millions of dollars to
rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of
climate change.''
	   As for global warming, he added his islands average just 2
meters (6 feet) above sea level, and global warming is ``not a
matter of economics and politics, but of life and death.''
