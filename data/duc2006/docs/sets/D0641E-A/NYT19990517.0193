 UNDATED: the Arctic.

   At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global
warming to changes in circulation patterns. But one study by
British and Italian scientists, reported recently in the journal
Nature, examined data on atmospheric circulation over the last 50
years in the Northern Hemisphere. The researchers looked to see
whether there had been any change in frequency of large-scale
circulation regimes. The data revealed that there had: in recent
decades, patterns had shifted to favor a warmer climate for most
land areas in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a general warming of the globe, the air above those land
areas would be expected to warm more than that above the oceans,
because of differing abilities to absorb heat. But the authors of
the new study postulate that the change in circulation patterns is
the main reason the land has lately warmed so much.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they say, the climate of the hemisphere shifts
naturally back and forth between two dominant regimes. Both the
North Atlantic and North Pacific oscillations are believed to be
affected by this shift. But if some external influence imparts a
warming or cooling impulse, the scientists say, the oscillation
could be tipped in favor of one regime or the other. The external
influence could be either natural, like a change in solar
radiation, or artificial, like carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is that you can understand much of the
observed climate change in terms of that picture,'' said Dr. Tim
Palmer, a climatologist at the European Center for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts in Reading, England, and one of the study's
authors. While the study does not prove that human-induced global
warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation
patterns, he said, the change is consistent with it.
</P>
<P>
   Such global warming would not produce new types of weather
patterns, he said, but it would change the probability of
occurrence of existing ones, Palmer said. And differing regional
patterns of warming are a direct consequence of that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another oscillation, in the Arctic, involves the strength of
high-altitude winds that circle the North Pole near the Arctic
Circle. The winds oscillate between stronger and weaker states,
with consequences for weather and climate farther south. Some
experts believe that the Arctic oscillation is being altered by
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6
to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming
the tropics but cooling the polar regions. This would increase the
temperature contrast between the two regions and thereby strengthen
the pole-girdling vortex of winds. This, according to the new
thinking, would in turn strengthen westerly winds off the Atlantic,
making northern Eurasia warmer and wetter.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, like Dr. John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Washington, think that the Arctic
and North Atlantic oscillations are so closely tied together as to
be the same thing. The effects of the Arctic oscillation over the
North Pacific, he said, are more subtle. ``It's hard to see them
clearly,'' he said, ``because another big thing is going on there;
that's the variability related to El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino-La Nina cycle is the strongest year-to-year natural
climatic oscillation. The two alternating states have markedly
different effects on weather. In a strong El Nino, for instance,
prevailing jet-stream winds slam into the southern tier of the
United States, producing floods, mudslides and tornadoes. In La
Nina, the central United States typically gets very cold weather as
well as tornadoes, while much of the East is warm and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, El Nino has appeared every two to seven years,
with La Nina showing up less often. But over the last two decades,
El Nino has appeared more frequently than before, and in much of
the 1990s it seemed to go on more or less continuously. Could this
be related to global warming?
</P>
<P>
   A number of scientists have raised the possibility. Dr. Kevin
Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has postulated that the
time interval between El Nino visitations depends on how long it
takes to recharge the tropical system by re-accumulating heat at
the sea surface. Global warming, he suggests, may enable the system
to recharge more rapidly, thereby making El Nino appear more often.
</P>
<P>
   Another study reported recently in Nature appeared to lend some
credence to this view. The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute
for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of
the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects
of global warming on El Nino's frequency. In the past, these
climate models have been unable to simulate the behavior of the
tropical Pacific finely enough to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Max Planck researchers said they had overcome that problem,
and their computer simulation produced more frequent El Nino
conditions as well as more powerful La Nina events.
</P>
<P>
   None of this constitutes anything remotely approaching a last
word on the response of the climate system's natural churnings to
global warming. But as Wallace says, experts have begun focusing on
responses ``that look like distortions of natural patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   All those patterns are part of a single, integrated climate
system, and scientists are just beginning to zero in on how they
relate to one another in the context of a warming atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That task only makes the problem of climate change more
complicated than ever. &QL;
