	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Scientists who argue against global warming
often cite nearly 20 years of satellite readings showing slight
cooling of the atmosphere two miles (3.2 kilometers) up. But a new
study indicates those readings are incorrect.
	   The new findings, however, do nothing to settle the debate over
whether global warming is really occurring.
	   Scientists on both sides agree that Frank Wentz, a physicist and
chief executive of Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, pinpointed
the problem with the satellite temperature readings. But that's as
far as they agree.
	   They continue to debate how the temperatures should be revised
and what the revisions mean. No one is changing his or her overall
position.
	   Those who reject the notion that manmade warming of the Earth is
occurring say the revised temperatures make an insignificant
change. Those who believe that carbon dioxide and industrial gases
are heating the atmosphere say the revisions now show a slight
warming trend, in line with the warming of the Earth's surface.
	   In the study in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, Wentz
found that the orbit of satellites that take temperature readings
decreases over time because of atmospheric drag on the spacecraft.
They drop a bit more than half a mile (about a kilometer) every
year, and twice that during some years.
	   As the satellite slows and drops, the onboard instrument
perceives the temperatures below it as cooling, Wentz found.
	   The perceived temperature change ``was just an artifact of the
altitude changing,'' he concluded.
	   When Wentz recalculated the readings from 1979 to 1995, he found
temperatures in the lower atmosphere are more in line with rising
temperatures at Earth's surface and rising temperatures just a few
miles (kilometers) higher in the atmosphere.
	   Before the correction, scientists were confounded because
temperatures in the lower troposphere, the region from the ground
to about two miles (3.2 kilometers) up, seemed to be cooling .09
degrees Fahrenheit (0.05 degrees Celsius) per decade, while the
middle to upper troposphere _ a region centered about four miles
(6.4 kilometers) up _ seemed to be warming .05 degrees Fahrenheit
(0.03 degrees Celsius) every decade.
	   But when Wentz and co-author Matthias Schabel took the falling
satellite effect into account, they found the lower troposphere was
warming 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit (0.07 Celsius) per decade.
	   In an accompanying commentary, Dian J. Gaffen of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources
Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, cautioned against ``making
too much of these new indications of warming'' because the
satellite data covers a short period and other factors could be at
work.
	   In the latest issue of the journal Science, James Hansen and
colleagues at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies wrote that
Wentz's work helps reconcile temperature trends that didn't make
sense.
	   With the correction, ``it's very hard for anyone to look at any
data and deny the reality of global warming. In a sense, it was the
last refuge of those who would deny that there's global warming,''
Hansen said.
	   Patrick Michaels, a professor of environmental sciences at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville and a global warming
skeptic, isn't convinced.
	   Wentz ``came up with no real change that's appreciable'' in the
satellite data, he said, and temperature readings from instruments
on helium balloons also haven't found significant warming.
	   John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville who did the original work with
the satellite data, said that when he corrected his data to account
for Wentz's findings and some other factors, he found only an
insignificant change _ ``no cooling, no warming.''
