	Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more  
time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers who studied northern winters since mid-century found  
that a weather pattern favoring typically milder winters was two to 
three times more likely to arise in the mid-1990s than around 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human  
industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in 
temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is telling us that we shouldn't expect to see unusual  
patterns we've never seen before. That's something the atmosphere 
is very reluctant to do. You'll just get certain patterns becoming 
more likely and other patterns being less likely,'' said Tim N. 
Palmer of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 
near Reading, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer and two colleagues from the Interuniversity Computing  
Centre in Bologna, Italy, studied atmospheric circulation data for 
winters in the Northern Hemisphere from 1949 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	They charted air circulation patterns into four ``clusters'' of  
high and low pressure systems, finding that the grouping favoring 
mild winters arose more frequently while patterns causing severe 
winters occurred less often. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in the April 29 issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They mean climatologists should devote more time to scrutinizing  
shifts in the natural variability of weather circulation patterns 
to understand global warming, said Tom Karl, director of the 
National Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these patterns now seem to have the odds loaded in  
their favor of occurring with more frequency and intensity,'' Karl 
said. ``This points out the importance of looking more closely at 
the patterns of climate circulation that affect the day-to-day 
weather we all experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored  
network of more than 2,000 scientists monitoring the global 
climate, has concluded that there is a ``discernible human 
influence'' on the climate through the burning of fossil fuels, 
which produce greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Trenberth, who heads the climate analysis section at the  
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said 
Palmer's findings don't prove or disprove whether human activity is 
affecting the climate. But he said evidence that the frequency of 
some weather patterns is changing shouldn't be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a step along the way in terms of making people  
think of things in a different way and ask different types of 
questions,'' he said. ``Global warming won't be a simple warming of 
the Earth. It's bound to be more complex than that.''
