   A study of changes in wind patterns linked to global warming
over the past 50 years suggests they are slowing the planet's daily
spin by around half a millisecond every century. These effects open
up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the
uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make
equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere. Momentum must be conserved, so the atmosphere steals
momentum from the Earth's rotation, making it spin more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite observations showed that last year's El Nio made days
drag on by an extra 0.4 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might
have a similar effect. Computer models of the effects of warming
point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the
troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the
Earth's surface. These would also boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere, triggering a compensating slowing down in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodrigo Abarca del Rio of the French space agency's Toulouse
Space Center has looked for direct evidence of this. Over the past
50 years, the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by
around 0.79 C per century.
</P>
<P>
   Using wind data for the same period from the U.S. National
Centers for Atmospheric Research and Environmental Prediction,
Abarca del Rio calculated the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
He found it had increased in step with the temperature rise
</P>
<P>
   ''There has also been a net loss in angular momentum by the
solid Earth,'' he says. ''The data suggest that global warming has
caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   This implies that global warming is responsible for almost
one-third of the slowing down in the Earth's spin scientists have
measured. It also suggests that the length of the day could provide
a means of monitoring global warming in future. Every 0.1 degree C
increase should produce a slowdown of 0.07 milliseconds, which is
easy to measure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abarca del Rio says too many other complex effects
influence the Earth's spin, such as movement of molten rock beneath
its surface. Instead, he suggests using records on atmospheric
angular momentum, which have been kept since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Records of surface air temperature have been the main measure
of global warming,'' says Abarca del Rio. ''Measurements of
atmospheric angular momentum may be an easier and more reliable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaki Satoh, a climate modeler at Saitama Institute of
Technology in Japan, agrees that the results could provide a new
and better way to monitor global warming. ''Atmospheric angular
momentum is increased by the El Nio event, so it is reasonable that
it should also increase with global warming.''  &QL;
