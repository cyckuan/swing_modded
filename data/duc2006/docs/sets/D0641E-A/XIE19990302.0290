WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Global warming may be
causing Spring to arrive a little earlier in Europe, and the
fall to come later, the Washington Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
After examing data, collected by the International
Phenological Gardens, researchers at the University of Munich
found, from 1959 to 1993, "Spring events," such as the emergence
of leaves on trees, have moved forward by about six days, while
"Autumn events," such as leaves changing color, have been
delayed by 4.8 days.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that the growing season over this period has
therefore lengthened by 10.8 days on average. They said that the
changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of
the effects of global warming.
