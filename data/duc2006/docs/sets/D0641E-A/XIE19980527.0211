<HEADLINE> Global Warming Affecting Antarctic Ice Sheet: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sea levels would rise as the
Antarctic ice sheet melted because of higher temperatures caused
by global warming, Australian geologists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New England University's Barrie McKelvey said a recent
Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition found evidences
that the ice sheet was considerably smaller during the last major
period of global warming 3-8 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery of remnants of river and lake sediment
was a major step in supporting the assertion that global warming
would lead to a rise in world sea levels.
</P>
<P>
"Global warming is happening all the time," McKelvey told the
Australian Associated Press in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"But this definitely challenges the belief that the ice sheet
won't be affected."
</P>
<P>
He said researchers found preserved elements of the landscape
predating the Antarctic ice sheet and strata from fossil valleys
created by lakes and rivers, but the materials still need to be
examined.
</P>
<P>
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely
effect of future global warming.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is an enormous and expensive task to study a
continental ice sheet that is twice as big as Australia."
</P>
<P>
The ice sheet currently contains 27 million cubic kilometers of
water which, if released, would cause a 65-meter rise in world sea
levels.
</P>
<P>
It would also result in climate change caused by the alteration
in deep sea water currents and temperatures, and a decrease in the
amount of solar heat reflected by ice into the atmosphere.
