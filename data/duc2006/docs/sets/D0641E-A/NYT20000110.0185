   SAN ANTONIO _ Environmental and religious groups are trying to
force ExxonMobil to admit that the world is getting hotter and that
people and industry are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to deny that global warming is happening,'' said
Peter Altman, national coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil, an
organization recently formed by about 40 environmental and
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the campaign is to persuade the nation's largest oil
company to withdraw from an industry group Altman contends is
trying to undermine acceptance of an international agreement that
would require industrialized nations to reduce emissions
contributing to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very successful in delaying policies that would
help us,'' Altman said of both ExxonMobil and the Global Climate
Coalition, which was formed and funded by ExxonMobil and other
business interests to raise questions about global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cirigliano, a spokesman for ExxonMobil in Dallas, said the
company recognizes ``the potential for climate change'' but
questions its cause and the wisdom of signing the international
agreement, known as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators hope to reach final agreement next year on the
treaty. Under the agreement, developed nations may be able to buy
or trade pollution credits with less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the current scientific understanding
justifies mandating a reduction in the use of fossil fuels,''
Cirigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``large economic harm would result from reductions
in fuel available to consumers by the adoption of the Kyoto
Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald North, head of the atmospheric sciences department at
Texas A&AMP;M University, said the majority of scientists agree that
the Earth's average temperature rose by at least 1 degree
Fahrenheit in the 1900s and is expected to rise even more in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a pretty broad consensus that we are
already seeing the warming, that man is the cause and that there
will probably be another three to five degrees of warming,'' said
North, who considers himself a moderate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says that the energy burned
to run automobiles, and to heat homes and businesses, contributes
to global warming. The EPA says there has been a dramatic increase
in atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases, including
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   North said the effect of global warming in Texas and the
projected corresponding 1-to-2-foot rise in the sea level could add
additional stress on already tight water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   It also could cause an increase in heat-related fatalities, as
well as the loss of beach, coastal habitat and fisheries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily the end of the world,'' North said.
``People are fairly adaptable. There will be irreversible change.
There's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman said the campaign seeks to pressure ExxonMobil board
members to follow Ford Motor Co.'s lead and withdraw from the
Global Climate Coalition, which he claimed confuses the public and
policymakers about the facts of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Kelly, the executive director of the Global Climate
Coalition, acknowledged his group represents businesses and
companies with a stake in how the climate issue is resolved, but he
defended its positions and statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many sides to the ongoing debate, and I think it's
disingenuous to suggest that just because we have a different view
of the climate that it's somehow a misinformation campaign,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions
whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies
voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions
that contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   North, however, said he has reservations about the group's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to protect industry, and they certainly
have a right to do so, but I think there's a certain amount of
dishonesty in their statements,'' he said. ``I think they belittle
scientists in the process, which is something I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters of the Holy Spirit, best known for its work with
teen mothers at the Healy-Murphy Center in San Antonio, also is
involved in Campaign ExxonMobil.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gabriella Lohan, the Sisters' general treasurer, said she
is optimistic that the oil company eventually will warm to the
campaign's position because religious groups have hundreds of
millions of dollars to invest and their congregations include
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow work, but we get it done,'' she said.
