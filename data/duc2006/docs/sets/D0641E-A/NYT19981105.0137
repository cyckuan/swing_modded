   Under way in Buenos Aires is a giant international conference on
global warming, a follow-up to last December's United
Nations-sponsored confab in Kyoto, Japan. Delegates to the summit
aim to put teeth into the treaty that came out of Kyoto, which
calls for the world's leading countries to sharply reduce their use
of energy over the next decade and a half. If implemented, the
treaty would force the most productive societies on earth _ the
ones that have led the way in making human life comfortable, safe,
and prosperous _ to slow their economic growth and degrade their
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the Buenos Aires conference take it for
granted, of course, that global warming is real. The ``consensus''
among scientists, it is said, is that the planet's temperature is
rising, the cause of the rise is the use of fossil fuels, and
disastrous climate changes are looming unless drastic changes are
made. The media likewise tend to take it as a given that the
experts are in accord on global warming. So do many politicians.
``The evidence of global warming keeps piling up,'' says Vice
President Al Gore, who has made the issue a personal crusade,
``month after month, week after week.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the scientists are all in agreement, who said this?
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the United States government to reject the global
warming agreement that was written in Kyoto. ... The proposed
limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the
advance of science and technology, and damage the health and
welfare of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release
of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing
(or will in the foreseeable future cause) catastrophic heating of
the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.
Moreover, there (itals)is(unitals) substantial scientific evidence
that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many
beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments
of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The carping of an oil-industry flack? The ignorant mutterings of
fringe anti-environmentalists?
</P>
<P>
   No. It is a petition signed by nearly 17,000 US scientists, half
of whom are trained in the fields of physics, geophysics, climate
science, meteorology, oceanography, chemistry, biology, or
biochemistry. The statement was circulated by the Oregon Institute
of Science and Medicine, along with an eight-page abstract of the
latest research on climate change. The abstract _ written for
scientists but comprehensible by laymen _ concludes that there is
no basis for believing (1) that atmospheric CO2 is causing a
dangerous climb in global temperatures, (2) that greater
concentrations of CO2 would be harmful, or (3) that human activity
leads to global warming in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The cover letter accompanying the petition and abstract was
penned by Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National Academy
of Sciences. (All these documents are available online at
www.oism.org/pproject.) The scientific ``consensus'' on global
warming, it turns out, does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Institute petition is no anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 climate scientists have endorsed the Leipzig
Declaration, which describes the Kyoto treaty as ``dangerously
simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive.'' The
endorsers include prominent scholars, among them David Aubrey of
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Larry Brace of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center; meteorologist Austin Hogan, who
co-edits the journal Atmospheric Research; Richard Lindzen, the
Sloane Professor of Meteorology at MIT; and Patrick Michaels, a
University of Virginia professor and past president of the American
Association of State Climatologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dire predictions of a future warming have not been
validated by the historic climate record,'' the Leipzig Declaration
says bluntly. ``In fact, most climate specialists now agree that
actual observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne
radiosondes show no current warming whatsoever _ in direct
contradiction to computer model results.'' The declaration, plus a
wealth of information on every aspect of the global warming
controversy, is posted at the Web site of the Science &AMP;
Environmental Policy Project, -www.sepp.org.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on in Buenos Aires is a costly exercise in
futility. The United States has not signed the Kyoto treaty; even
if President Clinton does sign it, there is no chance the Senate
will ratify it. And without US participation, any plan to curtail
CO2 emissions is doomed _ as it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is important to explode the myth that most
scientists are worried about global warming. Politicians shouldn't
be permitted to hijack science in their pursuit of power.
Environmentalists and journalists with an antibusiness itch to
scratch should be cross-examined whenever they claim there is only
one side to an issue of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   We've been down this ``consensus'' road before. Remember when
the Chicken Littles were warning that the earth was getting
(itals)colder(unitals)? ``The evidence in support of predictions
(of global cooling) has now begun to accumulate so massively,''
Newsweek claimed in 1975, ``that meteorologists are hard-pressed to
keep up with it.'' Except that there was no global cooling. The
alarmists were wrong then. They're wrong now.
