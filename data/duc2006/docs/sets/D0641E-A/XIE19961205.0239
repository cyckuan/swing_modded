<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Global Warming to Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists believe that
global warming, particularly higher winter temperatures, will
continue to the first half of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a key research project underway since the early 1990s,
nearly 100 scientists in China have concluded that the average
global temperature has risen about 0.5 degrees Centigrade over the
beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, led by Ye Duzheng, an aerophysicist and
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the
increase rate of gases that cause the greenhouse effect will
accelerate, so much so that the earth's warming trend will
continue in the coming dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Affected by natural changes and human activities, the average
winter temperature in northern China by the year 2030 will be 1 to
1.5 degrees Centigrade higher than the present figure, according
to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the increase rate of summer temperatures
will be lower than that in winter.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising
temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to
nature and human society. The production of wheat will rise, while
corn will yield a lower overall volume.
