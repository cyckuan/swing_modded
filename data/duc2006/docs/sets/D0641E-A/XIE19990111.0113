BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Global warming will further
aggravate the water shortage problem in North China as
evaporation of river water will far exceed rainfall, reported a
recent issue of the China Water Resources News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted scientist Ye Duzheng as saying that
compared with the current level, the temperature will be
increasing by 1.0-1.5 in winter by the year 2030, with rainfall
remaining unchanged, while the summer temperature will witness a
rise of 0.5-0.8 degrees Celsius, with rainfall edging up by 1-2
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the rainfall that results from global warming will
not be enough to make up the loss in river water, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the flow in the Haihe and Luanhe rivers will drop
by three to six percent from the present level.
</P>
<P>
Higher temperatures and severe water shortages will bring about
 a rise in winter wheat production, but a drop in spring wheat
and corn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the changed climate is also threatening to expand
the dry and arid area further north, forming a large sandy
desert.
