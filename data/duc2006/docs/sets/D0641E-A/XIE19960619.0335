<HEADLINE> American Scientist Disputes Global Warming Theory </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- There is neither evidence that
global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry
that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like
carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate, said an American
scientist.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn by Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was known because of a
reputation for brilliance that got him elected to the National
Academy of Sciences at age 37.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any evidence that this a serious problem," he
was quoted by the New York Times today as saying flatly.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old leading expert on the physical processes of the
atmosphere put up the challenge as climate experts firm up their
view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a panel of scientist, convened by the United Nations
to advise the world's governments, concluded for the first time
that green house gases like carbon dioxide are responsible for
changing global climate. The panel also predicted that if
emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global
temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
Lindzen disapproved this formal consensus about the climate
change, saying that the conclusions are based on computerized
models of the climate system. "I do not accept the model results
of evidence," he said. The physics of the atmosphere permit only a
minor and untroubling warming despite the build-up of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Lindzeb's idea is based on a fundamental point of physics:
carbon dioxide and the other waste gases generate only a small
amount of warming. The main candidate, whose presumed amplifying
effect is built into the computer models, is water vapor -- also a
heat-trapping gas, and the most powerful one since there is so
much of it and it is so pervasive.
</P>
<P>
The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor,
thereby increasing the warming even more. Without this
amplification, Dr. Lindzen said, the average global temperature
will rise only about a degree Fahrenheit if atmospheric carbon
dioxide is doubled.
