<HEADLINE> Global Warming Poses Threat to Public Health: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations health and
environmental agencies warn that global warming due to air
pollution "could have a wide range of impacts on human health."
</P>
<P>
The warning is given in a report due to be issued today when
international negotiations on global warming resume in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have become more and more concerned about the
possible health consequences of global warming. They believe that
the earth climate will change rapidly in the coming century as
pollution in the atmosphere traps solar radiation -- the so-called
greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
Within five years, according to the report, the warming of
climate could increase substantially the proportion of the world's
population living in potential malaria zones.
</P>
<P>
Heat waves triggered off by global warming have caused
thousands of additional deaths each year in major cities
worldwide, and would lead tens of millions of people to the risk
of malaria, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
According to another report issued by the World Energy Council
in London last Thursday, carbon dioxide emissions largely from
burning of fossil fuels rose 12 percent between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted the Centers for Disease Control
as reporting that a heat wave killed 465 people in Chicago, the
United States, alone, and in New York, where heat-related deaths
now average 320 per year, three to six times that many might die
annually by 2050.
