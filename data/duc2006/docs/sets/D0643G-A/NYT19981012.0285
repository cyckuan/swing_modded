   On Tuesday, ``Nova'' ventures on the track of El Nino, the
mysterious phenomenon that every few years rages out of the Pacific
Ocean to wreak havoc around the world. Its impact in 1997 and 1998
is fresh in memory.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when El Nino strikes is lamentably clear; the
puzzle of why has sent a team of scientists, the focus of Tuesday's
program, patrolling the Pacific with a long line of data-collecting
stations.
</P>
<P>
   What the scientists know already is that El Nino disrupts normal
weather patterns: Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the
warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back
toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982-83 El Nino, areas of Peru, which was hit first,
received 30 times the normal rainfall; the flooding cost Peru some
$1 billion in damages and 600 deaths. Worldwide damage came to $13
billion and 2,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Put in place in 1994, the El Nino detection system, perhaps the
largest scientific instrument ever built, is kept afloat by buoys.
Constantly monitoring the Pacific's winds and waves, the system's
70 stations can come up with hints of suspicious changes and may
deliver an El Nino forecast, as they did in 1997. But what was
predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and
television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   A result was destruction from Africa to California, where
meteorologists can be seen flying smack into the storms to measure
their impact. It makes for quite a show, and the only sure
prediction about El Nino is that it will come again.
