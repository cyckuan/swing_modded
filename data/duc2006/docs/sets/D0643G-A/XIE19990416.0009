<HEADLINE> El Nino Helps Ocean to Trap Carbon Dioxide: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite causing anomaly of weather
and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by
temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the
Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have found that during the El
Nino years between 1991 and 1994, the release of carbon dioxide
from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of
that in 1996, a non-El Nino year.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino clearly has a marked influence on the overall carbon
dioxide flux," the researchers wrote in a letter to the British
science journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the
atmosphere each year. Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas,
those where water is rising to the surface release the gas.
</P>
<P>
The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial
Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial
warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is the source
of 72 percent of the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from
the equatorial oceans.
</P>
<P>
Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be
in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned.
But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each
year.
</P>
<P>
The NOAA team's new research helps explain the lower growth in
carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during those years.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases
in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of
this "missing" carbon dioxide.
