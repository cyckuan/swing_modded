	   GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to
continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La
Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
	   ``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World
Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update. La
Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the
eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
	   By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in
evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the
International dateline, WMO said.
	   The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the
tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June.
	   The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia
in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon. It
has also brought rain to Australia.
	   An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is
consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said.
	   Last Sept. 24, four Atlantic hurricanes were active at the same
time, the first time this has happened this century.
	   El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large
mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east
along the equator toward South America.
	   During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere
above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns. The
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in
California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and
tornadoes and flooding in Florida.
	   La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with
the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. During La
Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take
hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and
flooding and rains return to Asia.
	   Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia,
``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less
disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said.
	   ``However, La Nina's relatively benign image may not be entirely
appropriate,'' it cautioned.
	   WMO added that uncertainty over surface temperatures in the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which contribute to changing rainfall
over Africa and South America, makes an accurate forecast
difficult.
	   But it said there are increased possibilities of below-normal
rainfall in eastern Africa through next March.
