<HEADLINE> Global Warming Might Spur El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if  
global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as 
droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer 
study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	That might happen around the year 2050 if nothing is done to  
control emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, 
said researcher Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for 
Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming  
of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. It 
happens every three to four years on average. It can disrupt 
climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern 
United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought 
in the western Pacific, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer simulation suggests that unrestrained global  
warming could set up the same kind of pattern in ocean surface 
temperatures, but as a more or less constant condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Latif and colleagues report their findings in Thursday's issue  
of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the study suggests that the Pacific would warm more  
in the east than the west. That's because the western part is 
already so warm that with further heating it would spawn clouds 
that provide cooling shade, Latif said. 
</P>
<P>
	The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five  
years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called 
La Nina, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But Latif said scientists have ``a long way to go'' before they  
can be sure the study's conclusions are correct. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in  
Boulder, Colo., agreed it will take more study to understand how 
global warming might affect El Nino. Studies have disagreed on 
whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface 
temperatures, he said.
