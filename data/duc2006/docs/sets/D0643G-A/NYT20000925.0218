FORECASTERS IN SEARCH OF EL NINO AND LA NINA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming
and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino
and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with
little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two,
bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of
storms and droughts, heat and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a record El Nino in 1997 and 1998, followed almost
immediately by a prolonged La Nina, the tropical Pacific has shaken
off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year to be
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   So one might think meteorologists could relax a bit. But it is
exactly the opposite, many of them say. Now they are sweating. With
no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no
strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow
of weather across the seas and continents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, long-term forecasts _ the ones that help determine
the price of oil or natural gas futures, the ones that determine
how much road salt your town buys this fall _ are looking a bit
like guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years, a lot of people have looked pretty
sharp,'' said Dr. William C. Patzert, a research oceanographer at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``Now the
going gets tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an
understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in
winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow
east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina. They
have still not found a way to predict when one or the other will
develop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the El Nino that formed in 1997 and boosted global
temperatures to record highs was unanticipated, as was its
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But once one of the conditions settles into place,
meteorologists have become adept at predicting the consequences and
incorporating those patterns into long-term forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Patzert said, the surface temperature of the tropical
Pacific varies only a few degrees Fahrenheit through the course of
a year. An El Nino can raise surface temperatures 14 degrees above
normal over an area three times the size of the contiguous United
States. A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   More heat causes more evaporation and more rising hot air,
meaning more storms. Cooler temperatures, Patzert said, create the
equivalent ``of a stone in a stream,'' nudging storm tracks and the
jet stream out of place.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has been linked to strong winter storms that batter
southern California, to a weak hurricane season in the Atlantic as
high-altitude winds shear the towering tops from developing
tropical storms, to searing droughts in southern Asia like the one
that spawned enormous rain forest fires in Indonesia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A La Nina, among other things, seems to nurture Atlantic
hurricanes, push the North American winter storm track further
north, and bring heat and drought to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Without either, weather becomes typical _ meaning largely
unpredictable _ meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The government's long-term forecast maps for this winter retreat
largely to what meteorologists call ``climatology'' _ essentially a
tossup _ with most of North America given an even chance of having
below average, above average, or average temperatures.
Precipitation charts are a little less equivocal, but only a
little.
</P>
<P>
   To point out just how fuzzy things will be in coming months, Dr.
Tim P. Barnett, a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in San Diego, described government predictions for his
home town: ``For San Diego this winter, indicators range from
extremely heavy precipitation to very dry, with all categories
equally likely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said meteorologists, if they are prudent, will likely include
strong caveats in any long-term forecasts in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to say that's the way it is,'' Barnett said.
Without anything driving the system, he added, ``the atmosphere
tends to be its wonderful chaotic normal self, and that makes
forecasting very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that this may not always be the case. Dr. John
O. Roads, the director of the experimental climate prediction
center at Scripps, said that new work is showing that there are
plenty of other subtle influences on long-term weather that should
eventually improve predictions, even in years without the strong
influence from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to
influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at
Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with
some success.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be years before these forces are incorporated in
official forecasts issued by federal climate prediction centers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One place where the frontier of forecasting is already being
pushed is at private forecasting companies whose predictions are
sold to commodities traders, utilities, or other customers whose
business relies on anticipating future weather.
</P>
<P>
   To prosper, these companies have to offer a product that is
better than the government's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   A false move can make or break a trader trying to anticipate the
price of winter wheat or heating oil or natural gas, said Drew
Lerner, a meteorologist for Bridge Global Weather Services, a
private forecasting company in Overland, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his competitors have to look at subtler
influences on weather, including things like sunspot cycles or soil
condition in the Midwest or other less obvious temperature shifts
in the Pacific and Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take all these things and try to put it all together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his predictions for this winter are a lack of strong
storms along the Atlantic coast, colder than normal temperatures in
the northern Plains and Great Lakes region, and abundant January
precipitation from the lower Middle West to the mid-Atlantic
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   But it all would have been a lot easier if the last La Nina had
stuck around a few more months, Lerner said.
