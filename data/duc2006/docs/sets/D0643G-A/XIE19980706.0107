<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Studies Effects of El Nino to Help Farmers </HEADLINE>

DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is studying the effects of
El Nino in order to develop a model to help farmers understand the
global weather pattern when the ocean current in the Pacific coast
off Peru warms up or cools down, a press report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization
(SPARRSO) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon, which is
responsible for rains or drought world-wide, to help the country's
farmers cope with its effects, SPARRSO director Dr. A.M. Chowdhury
told a recent function at the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
Farmers needed help to chart their crop calendar to keep
themselves updated with the changing mood of nature to better cope
with it, and vary the sowing and planting periods, he said, adding
that the model would be prepared by the SPARRSO and the Bangladesh
Agriculture Research Council.

"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance
of El Nino," the weather expert said.
</P>
<P>
Since El Nino went 'retreating' in May, it has begun casting
its eye on Bangladesh for the past few days, bringing much needed
rains, he noted, adding that the reverse was likely to trigger
rainfall and flooding.
</P>
<P>
On the past effects of El Nino, he said that after it occurred
in 1972-73, El Nino reversed to trigger floods in 1974, in 1982-83
it reversed into a spate of flooding, and again in 1986, El Nino
led to the worst flooding when it reversed in 1987 and 1988
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon had been responsible for only 40 percent
rainfall in the country in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only we had 60 percent less rainfall in June, but it also
delayed the arrival of Monsoon by a month," he added.
