<P>
GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) held a first follow-up meeting on El Nino here
today after a United Nations inter-agency task force on the
phenomenon was set up on Wednesday.

<P>
The meeting will provide scientific and technical information
on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces
acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect
weather patterns in many areas of the globe.
</P>
<P>
According to WMO, strong warm episode (El Nino) conditions have
persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997. Sea surface
temperatures throughout the equatorial east-central Pacific
increased during April and May, when temperatures normally
decrease in this region.

<P>
During August and September, ocean surface temperatures reached
near-record levels in many sections of the equatorial Pacific.
Departures from normal exceeded +4 degrees Celsius along the
Equator east of 120 degrees West, and were greater than +5 degrees
Celsius near the Galapagos Islands and along the coast of northern
Peru, WMO says in its new publication, El Nino Update.
