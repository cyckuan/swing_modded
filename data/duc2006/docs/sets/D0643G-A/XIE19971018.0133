JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African weather
experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping
to hit South Africa stronger than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Long-term forecaster Emsie Klopper said on Thursday that it
was clear from current rain patterns that El Nino had arrived.
</P>
<P>
According to the Weather Bureau in Pretoria, the capital of
South Africa, the cold and rainy weather being experienced in
most parts of the summer rainfall region in South Africa was not
normal for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
It was an indication that global weather patterns were being
disturbed by an El Niono event, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed
weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on
South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry
conditions from November to March were correct.
</P>
<P>
The general El Nino forceast was that in South Africa and
other countries in the Southern Hemisphere normal or above-normal
rainfall would occur in the first part of the season with a drier
spell in the second part of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry said earlier that
South Africa was in a better position this year than it was when
the previous serious El Nino event struck in 1982/83.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's water storage levels at major reservoirs were
the best since 1940 and there should be enough water to last
through the normal duration of an El Nino event, the department
said.
