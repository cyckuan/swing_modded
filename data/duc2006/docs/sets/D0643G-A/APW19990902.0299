<HEADLINE> El Nino Not As Bad As Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a while it seemed as though everything  
from tornadoes to toadstools and hailstorms to hemlines was being 
blamed on El Nino. Now, it turns out the periodic weather event 
produced a lot more good than bad. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A. Changnon, who  
calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 
deaths, it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that 
would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed  
by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in the 
September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you treat it as an economic outcome for the country ...  
most of the country benefited,'' Changnon said. 
</P>
<P>
	True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms  
in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an 
ice storm in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the  
Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured, just watching what was happening, that it was going  
to be a zero-sum game but it turned out far from that,'' Changnon 
said in a telephone interview from his Mahomet, Ill., home. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Glantz, an El Nino expert at the National Center for  
Atmospheric Research in Colorado, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a noble attempt but I wouldn't take the numbers to the  
bank,'' he said. ``I'm wary of trying to cost out weather events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his paper, Changnon admitted there could be up to a 30  
percent variation in the costs and benefits cited, but noted that 
would still produce considerably more benefit than loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere  
Prediction Studies at Florida State University, welcomed Changnon's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Nino is a good dude for the United States,'' O'Brien said  
in a telephone interview. ``In actuality, La Nina is worse for the 
United States, there are more hurricanes, there is an increase in 
tornadoes and they spread over a wider region ... there is 
drought,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern  
Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that 
area and can affect the climate worldwide. La Nina, an abnormal 
cooling of the Pacific sea surface, is currently taking place. It, 
too, can affect the world's weather. La Ninas sometimes occur 
between El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Changnon, as few as 100 people died in winter cold  
and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino, well below the average of 
850 in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally mild temperatures ``greatly reduced lives lost to  
extreme cold,'' Changnon wrote, and there also were fewer 
weather-related auto accidents and deaths in winter storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Nino's influence on the atmosphere led to the elimination  
of major Atlantic hurricanes during 1997,'' he added. That meant no 
lives lost compared to the average of 20 in recent years and it 
meant an enormous savings for home and business owners, governments 
and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild temperatures also saved businesses and homeowners  
millions of dollars they didn't have to spend on heating fuel, 
Changnon said, though that also can be calculated as a loss for 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of demand for heating fuel made oil a glut on the market,  
resulting in the price of gasoline dropping to as low as 80 cents a 
gallon in some parts of the country, O'Brien pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the economic benefits of the mild winter,  
Changnon reported, ``Thousands went out of doors more, millions 
went shopping, many altered their types of recreation, and almost 
everyone enjoyed better health than in normal winters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glantz raised the ``question of what is a normal year, which no  
one has defined. No one has calculated to the U.S. the cost of 
weather in a normal year. Extremes are going on every year,'' he 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's admirable that he tried to put numbers on this stuff,''  
Glantz concluded, but ``it's very hard to attribute weather 
events.''
