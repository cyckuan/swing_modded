<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say El Nino Due Next Around 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's National Research Center
for Marine Environmental Forecasts said today that next El Nino
will occur around 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to the center's Dr. Wang Zhanggui, El Nino is related
to sunspot activity, and generally occurs four to five years after
a period of little sunspot activity, which was the case last year,
when there was strong El Nino activity.
</P>
<P>
Song Xuejia, the center's deputy director, says that no other
scientists have made such a "bold prediction" before. They reached
their conclusion after having studied a large amount of materials
on unspots and El Nino for the last 250 years.
</P>
<P>
"No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which
records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity
increases," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Sunspot activity is expected to increase this year and will
reach its apex in 2000, according to the Royal Observatory of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Sunspot activity will decrease again in 2006 and complete
another cycle. Wang predicts that two to three El Ninos will occur
in the first seven years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues found the links between sunspot
activity and El Nino through satellite photos, and say that
sunspot activity can affect ocean temperatures and cloud, which
give rise to El Nino.
