   SAN FRANCISCO _ La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's
hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather
around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal
temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to
government forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial
waters in the central Pacific. It ended the record El Nino event
last May but has been just as disruptive as its brother, scientists
say. It is blamed for flooding and heavy snow in the West,
abnormally warm weather in the East and extreme weather from South
America to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This La Nina provides the physical link between many of the
unusual weather patterns seen in far-flung parts of the globe,''
said John Janowiak, a scientist for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``While parts of Alaska have experienced severe cold, most of
the lower 48 states, especially those in the southern tier, have
enjoyed record-breaking warm temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the still-strengthening La Nina pattern has built the
Sierra Nevada's snowpack to record highs and sent Alaskan
temperatures to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   And, forecasters say, still more snow in the next two or three
months will stack up on top of a snowpack that already measures 478
inches at the Kirkwood ski resort in Alpine County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The snowpack is about twice normal in many areas and as high as
last year's record El Nino year in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its nearly 40 feet of snow, Kirkwood is only the
second snowiest site in North America. Mount Baker in Washington
state has received a couple of feet more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service also predicts colder-than-normal
temperatures on the West Coast through May, when La Nina may still
be in force.
</P>
<P>
   The colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures have grown into
one of the strongest La Nina episodes in 50 years, according to
scientists at the weather service's climate prediction center in
Camp Springs, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the lower 48 have been warmer than normal, with
many states reporting among their warmest November-January periods
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States as a whole had its third-warmest
November-January period of the past 104 years.
</P>
<P>
   On La Nina's downside, huge storms with hurricane-force winds
blasted Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and there has
been flooding in some northern states. At the same time, wide areas
of the Southwest are experiencing drought.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's impacts include heavy rains, severe storms and
flooding in southern Africa, drought in Kenya and Tanzania,
flooding in the Philippines and Indonesia and abnormal wetness in
northern South America. The extreme weather is just the opposite of
the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.
