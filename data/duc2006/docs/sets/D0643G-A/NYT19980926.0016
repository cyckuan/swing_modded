WEAKENING LA NINA MAY NOT BRING DRY WINTER

   LOS ANGELES -- Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los
Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the
weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength, according to
scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of cold Pacific water that is the heart of La Nina has
shrunk to one-fourth the size it was in May, even as warm water
left over from El Nino remains, said Bill Patzert, a researcher at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration laboratory in
suburban Pasadena. If La Nina dissipates before it hits Los
Angeles, the area could face a more typical wet winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El
Nino lingers?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic
cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern
Pacific and La Nina driven by cold. Each can bring drought to some
parts of the planet while drenching others with rain.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted
that La Nina -- a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite
of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count La Nina out yet. Patzert and other weather experts
say the cold water pool often fluctuates in size as the phenomenon
builds.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,''
said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate
Prediction Center. ``It's pretty dangerous to look week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the center predicted that after rapid cooling during the
summer, ocean temperatures would rebound before cooling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecasts are still on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the
heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and
don't alternate in an orderly progression.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the
ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino on record. Although La
Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it hasn't
noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is
contributing to the formation of more tropical storms than normal
in the eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hundred-year El Nino, and it really rang the
Pacific's bell,'' Leetmaa said.
