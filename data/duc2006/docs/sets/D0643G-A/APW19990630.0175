<HEADLINE> La Nina Seems To Be Vanishing </HEADLINE>

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The weather-altering La Nina phenomenon  
has all but vanished from the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA 
satellite observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool of unusually cool tropical water marked by low sea  
levels has shriveled and the equatorial Pacific is warming to 
normal temperatures, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a  
La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until 
it has completely subsided. La Nina has shrunk several times and 
then had a resurgence over the past 12 months, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm  
temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions 
to the South. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America,  
and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.
