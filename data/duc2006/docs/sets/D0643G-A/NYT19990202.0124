   When 1998 began, East Africa should have been at its most
beautiful. Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but
this year was different.
</P>
<P>
   The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all
started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get
sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure
mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when
standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and
animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to
jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange
weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold
snaps and heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this
year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty
expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents
and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered
weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was,
of course, the work of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of
sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs
offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full
flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In
addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an
upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue
fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this
year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in
the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that
they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El
Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in
advance. The bad news is that according to some research this
latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El
Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and
Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature
Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut
off this wind or that current to see which factors were most
important to El Nino's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They built a simple computer model, and almost as an
afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It
accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then,
in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the
onset of a string of El Ninos.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer
models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able
to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create
the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along
New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to
making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer
models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's
behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from
the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about
El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other
parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea
surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it
possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in
years without a big El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency
of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the
Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of
El Nino does change.
</P>
<P>
   From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from
1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again,
and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
</P>
<P>
   The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this
year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the
occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a
powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather
with stunning swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of
the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of
the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean
to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then
stay that way for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so
far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos
to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is
even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth
contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional
visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.
