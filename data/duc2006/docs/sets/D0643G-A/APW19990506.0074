	Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina,  
the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the 
Pacific Ocean, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of the same widespread weather trend that dumped a  
record 91 feet of snow on Mount Baker in Washington this winter and 
triggered severe drought and wildfires in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signal is there,'' said Steve Byrd, science officer for  
the National Weather Service in Omaha, Neb. ``The incidence of 
tornadoes on the central Plains is slightly higher during La 
Nina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the  
equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and 
influences weather patterns around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El  
Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina has generated a stronger, colder jet stream in the upper  
atmosphere, while warm, wet air at lower levels has been pulled 
from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	This combination generated the ferocious thunderstorms that  
spawned dozens of twisters, including a historic F-5 tornado in 
Oklahoma City. An F-5 is the most powerful tornado there is. At 
least 41 people have died in Oklahoma alone as the result of the 
severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year. Most La  
Ninas last only several months, and there are signs that this one 
is beginning to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that  
dissipated in 1998. Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as 
much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America  
while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. La Ninas, 
by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in 
other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, meteorologists in Nebraska and Iowa already have  
tallied 17 tornadoes -- five more than normal by early May. ``We're 
already living up to predictions,'' Byrd said.
