World meteorologists say El Nino disruptions coming to an end

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ There was good news Wednesday from the world's
weather forecasters: the massive disruptions caused by El Nino are
coming to an end.
	   The World Meteorological Organization said the current round of
El Nino ``is in its dying stages,'' but conceded there was
considerable uncertainty ``about the rate of weakening.''
	   El Nino, a disruptive weather phenomenon that returned in 1997,
has been blamed for flooding in Kenya, drought in Indonesia and
heavy snow in the southwestern United States. It has even been
credited with lengthening the days on Earth by slowing its
rotation.
	   Unlike previous episodes which lingered for years, the current
El Nino ``is showing clear signs of weakening,'' said the World
Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency.
	   The organization's update said the four conditions typical of
the weather phenomenon are becoming less pronounced. Those
conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of
precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of
trade winds; and changes in sea level.
	   El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting
in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
	   It also helps trigger some man-made disasters. For example,
fires set by farmers and plantation owners in Indonesia in 1997 and
1998 swept through unusually dry forests, shrouding much of
Southeast Asia in thick haze.
	   The World Meteorological Association (WMO) said it is difficult
to predict just when this round of El Nino will come to an end.
	   ``One model has conditions moving rapidly towards normal by
mid-1998, and another has El Nino lingering on towards the end of
the year,'' the report stated.
	   During a press conference Tuesday, the organization's
secretary-general Godwin Obasi, of Nigeria, said he expected the
former scenario, with El Nino tapering off by the end of this
month.
	   Such a development could be followed by the so-called La Nina
effect, which could reverse some of the effects of the current
disturbances and, in Southeast Asia, help curb some of the forest
fires.
	   However, the international weathermen said it's far from certain
whether La Nina will occur.
	   The U.N. weather agency predicts drier-than-normal conditions
over Indonesia, Micronesia and southern South America during the
next two months. Wetter conditions than usual will continue over
the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern
South America.
	   John Miller, chief of the environment division at WMO, told The
Associated Press that the forecast was a conservative prediction
that discounted the possibility of an immediate end to El Nino or a
La Nina episode.
	   This was despite growing evidence to suggest such an occurrence,
because forecasts rely on a consensus of results in the computer
predictions.
