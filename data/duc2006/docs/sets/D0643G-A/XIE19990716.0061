<HEADLINE> Satellites Can Give Warning of Disease Outbreak in Africa </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Weather satellite data that
detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El
Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an
outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by
researchers.
</P>
<P>
The study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked
the warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased
rains in Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a
mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland
State of the United States and the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research in Washington analyzed 50 years of weather and medical
data to establish the connection between warm oceans, rains and
the fever.

"We discovered a cycle of Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that
appeared to depend on rainfall," said Kenneth Linthicum of Walter
Reed. "There were large outbreaks every seven to 10 years, but the
virus apparently disappears between outbreaks."
</P>

Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard researcher who uses satellites to
study the oceans, said that East Africa gets more rain during an
El Nino, but that this effect, alone, is not enough to prompt a
fever outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A fever outbreak is more likely to occur when the Indian Ocean
warms at the same time as there is an El Nino, a phenomenon that
includes the warming of Pacific Ocean waters.
</P>
<P>
"When the western equatorial Indian Ocean is similar to the
East Pacific in sea-surface temperature, there will likely be a
large-scale outbreak of Rift Valley Fever," said Anyamba.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said their study suggests that satellite data that
measures sea surface temperature, along with measurements of
vegetation growth in East Africa, could pinpoint areas where Rift
Valley Fever outbreaks are most likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
They said that satellite data could give a two-to-five-month
warning of a Rift Valley Fever outbreak. This would give time to
vaccinate livestock and to treat mosquito habitats with
insecticides that are released upon flooding. This would prevent
the mosquitoes from hatching and, thus, break the cycle of
disease.
