<HEADLINE> Link Shown Between El Nino, Global Warming: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
uncovered a link between global warming and the increasing
frequency of the El Nino weather system, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were
showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a
result of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Steve Wilson, a scientist of the climate modeling program at
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), Australia's top national scientific research body,
explained that a sophisticated computer model set up at the CSIRO
laboratories showed a relationship between sea surface temperature
anomalies and the warm El Nino phase.
</P>
<P>
When the present levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide
were doubled in the experiment, the number of El Ninos affecting
Australia nearly doubled too, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Barry Hunt, leader of the research project, told the program he
wanted more time to verify the model's findings.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to do a more elaborate and longer experiment but as
far as I know, we are the only group who actually found the change
in the frequency of El Nino events," Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
The program said experiments on the relationship between
increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at
the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian
claims.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that we have a very good case for suggesting that
the El Ninos are going to become more frequent ... and more
intense and, in a few years or a decade, so we'll go into a
permanent El Nino," Mauna Loa Director Russell Schneider told the
program.
</P>
<P>
Hunt said climate warming's affect on El Nino was complex, even
showing that a gradual increase in carbon dioxide output would
make the Australian continent drier, while, if the output were
doubled, the effect would actually make Australia wetter.
</P>
<P>
The model's scenario showed Australia getting drier for about
100 years at which time it would become wetter than it currently
is.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Climate Convention will be held in Japan
next month and Australia has argued against binding uniform
targets, preferring the concept of differentiation which would
consider the varying economic circumstances of developed
countries.
