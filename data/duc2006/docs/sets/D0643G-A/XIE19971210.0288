<HEADLINE> NASA: El Nino is Petering out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 9 (Xinhua) --U.S. space agency NASA said
that the warm Pacific water current known as El Nino has become
weaker, shrinking by at least 10 percent and falling to the level
last observed in early September, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.

<P>
Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory came the
conclusion after analyzing the data collected from satellite last
week.
</P>
<P>
Climate experts said this year's El Nino was one of the
century's largest and most disruptive weather phenomena.
</P>
<P>
However the latest data on El Nino from a NASA satellite made
them conclude that El Nino has completed its second peak. Over the
next several weeks, the El Nino current could peter out, or it may
simply be pausing before gathering greater force, they said.
