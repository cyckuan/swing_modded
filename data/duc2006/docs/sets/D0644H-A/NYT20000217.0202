<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
said Thursday that the powerhouse economy shows few signs of
slowing despite four interest rate increases over the past eight
months, and he warned that the central bank will probably raise
rates further to avert a buildup of inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said the
current combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining
unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers
was unprecedented in the half century he has spent monitoring the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to
gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to
take some steam out of the expansion, which this month became the
longest on record at eight years and 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed next meets to consider monetary policy on March 21, and
economists said the tone of Greenspan's testimony Thursday all but
ensured that the central bank would act then to raise its benchmark
federal funds target rate by another quarter of a point, to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position
that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the
national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending. He said the
recent turmoil in the bond market caused by the gradual reduction
in the quantity of Treasury debt was having no effect on the Fed's
ability to slow the economy through increases in the short-term
rates it controls. And he said he was somewhat worried by the
recent sharp rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too
strong for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the
labor market, he said, where a rapidly declining pool of jobless
workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that
could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market.
Buoyant stock prices, he said, were fueling consumer spending and
business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the
economy was outstripping supply.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to resolve that fundamental imbalance, he said, was
to sharply curtail the relentless rise in equity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in blue chip stock seemed to heed his warning, sending
the Dow Jones industrial average down during the day. But as they
have repeatedly over the past few years, investors in technology
stocks thumbed their noses at Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew
more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster
pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably,''
Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to
Congress on the economy and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the very factors underpinning the nation's
remarkable economic performance _ falling joblessness, accelerating
productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ ``are
also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained,
threaten our continuing prosperity,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge
in imports, which have made up for the inability of domestic
producers to keep up with demand, and by the willingness of people
who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   But those ``safety valves,'' he said, could not contain
inflationary pressures forever, especially since the rate increases
so far have done little to rein in growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee ``will
have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet
risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of
potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity
continue,'' Greenspan said. ``Achieving that alignment seems more
pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of
imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various
buffers against inflationary pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of rebalancing the economy, he said, would be limiting or
ending the rise in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values _
although that, of course, can happen at any time for a number of
reasons _ but rather that these values will rise no faster than
household incomes,'' Greenspan said.
