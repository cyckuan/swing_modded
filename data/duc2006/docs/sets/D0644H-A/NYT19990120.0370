   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government
funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the
Social Security retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the U.S. economy and it
was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock
market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions
from ``political forces,'' raising the prospect that specific
investment decisions could be influenced by non-financial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the investment of government funds in private
equity markets,'' Greenspan told the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Opposed any major tax cuts, a cherished goal of congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warned that current high stock prices were unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton
proposed investing 62 percent of the projected $4 trillion federal
budget surplus over the next 15 years in the stock market. Any
revenues from the investments would be used for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would be able to set up individual retirement accounts
with government funds. Investors would have a choice of investing
in a handful of stock and bond funds along with adding their own
money to such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Individual retirement accounts, or IRA's, allow people to save
money for retirement while receiving special tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the current Social Security system is changed it will run
out of money in about 2030 when the number of retirees is projected
to be greater than the working population. Social Security
recipients receive money from current workers, a system that
functions as long as there are more workers than retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he supports using federal budget surpluses to
strengthen Social Security, but suggested that the market for
government securities is a more secure place to invest public funds
because the government guarantees payment on its securities.
Historically, government securities have been less risky but slower
growing.
</P>
<P>
   He also voiced a philosophical objection to pouring federal
money into the stock market, arguing such a move could hurt the
economy by interfering with private market forces in deciding which
companies to fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman agreed that the Social Security
System needed to be repaired but he offered few suggestions on how
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan chaired a federal task force in the early 1980s that
recommended a series of changes to Social Security, which helped
keep the system from going broke at the time.
</P>
<P>
   While the Social Security issue is expected to receive more
attention in Congress this year, Republicans are also eying the
budget surplus for tax cuts. A major component of their legislative
package is a plan to cut federal income tax rates by 10 percent.
This, for example, would lower the 28 percent tax bracket to 25.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this particular stage with the economy doing well...we
don't need a tax cut,'' Greenspan said. He said the best medicine
to ensure the long-term health of the economy is to use the budget
surplus to pay off a portion of the $5 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, if Congress can't keep its hands off the surplus,
the money should be used for tax cuts rather than new spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling''
and said he has yet to see signs of any economic slow-down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Greenspan said, ``some moderation'' in the economy
might be needed to bring the economy back to a point where it
doesn't threaten to spark inflation, or a rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   A slowdown in the economy is likely if the stock market cannot
sustain what Greenspan called its ``unusual'' recent gains in the
face of weaker corporate profits. Corporate profits help determine
individual stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he doubted that the market could maintain its
current high level. A flattening or drop in the market would likely
dampen consumer spending, which has been the main force behind the
economy's recent strong performance.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street generally reacted positively to Greenspan as he
signaled that the Federal Reserve wasn't likely to change interest
rates any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 75 points
after Greenspan's remarks but ultimately closed down 19.31 points
to 9,335.91. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.61 to 1,256.61, and
the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.32 to 2,415.49.
