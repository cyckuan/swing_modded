<HEADLINE> Treasury Posts $4.76B July Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal treasury posted a surplus of $4.76
billion in July, smaller than June's $56.3 billion surplus but a
rare feat since July usually is marked by a budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The government's surplus last month, announced by the Treasury
Department on Friday, compared with a $25.2 billion deficit in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the government posted a surplus in July
since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is on track to produce a record bounty for the entire
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for July totaled $134.1 billion, while expenditures came
to $129.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1, the
government is running a surplus of $181 billion -- far surpassing
the record $124.4 billion surplus for all of fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the first nine months came to $1.67 trillion, while
spending totaled $1.49 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, it would be the
first time the government has reported three consecutive surplus
years since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $224 billion surplus
for fiscal 2000, while the Congressional Budget Office is
projecting a slightly larger $232 billion.
