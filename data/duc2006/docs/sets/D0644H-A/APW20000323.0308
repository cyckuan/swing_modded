<HEADLINE> House Debates $1.82 Trillion Budget  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite unrest by some conservatives,
Republicans drove a $1.82 trillion budget for 2001 toward House
passage on Thursday, mapping out deeper tax cuts and lower domestic
spending than President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least
$150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $1 trillion in projected
Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said. It
would also leave the door open for creating a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare recipients with a price tag of up to $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to support this
budget,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
echoing a campaign theme of apparent GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused
Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-Social Security
programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to
buttress Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the Republican budget to a television game show, Rep.
Brad Sherman, D-Calif., asked, ''Who wants to risk Social Security
to give huge tax breaks to multi-multi-multi-millionaires?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plan embraces spending cuts so severe
that Congress would never approve, and they challenged the GOP's
numbers, saying the Republican plan would eat into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied that, with Kasich saying that to arrive at
that conclusion, Democrats had to ''cook numbers and make things
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals for
defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many
married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such
details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific
programs in later bills.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating administration opposition to the GOP plan, White
House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders that it is
''fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable
economic plan. In the past, this approach has delayed, rather than
expedited, action on'' subsequent budget legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans supported the proposal. But eight conservatives
voted ''no'' on an early procedural vote because they said it
lacked controls to ensure that spending remained within budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we'll spend $25 billion to $30 billion more than what
we say,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the
discontented group. ''It's another wink and nod from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP's wafer-thin 11-seat House margin, their defections
could jeopardize the budget's final passage. Party leaders labored
throughout the day to quell the uprising, and succeeded after
promising efforts to prevent spending bills from growing as they
move through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative disaffection was mirrored in the Senate. There,
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has yet to
even try pushing a similar plan through his panel because
conservatives want to hold spending down.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the $596.5 billion the budget would set aside for
jet fighters, road building and every other federal function but
automatically paid benefits like Medicare and interest on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $307 billion would be for defense, $1 billion
more than Clinton's request. Its $289 billion for domestic programs
is almost $30 billion below the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   In early votes, the House overwhelmingly rejected five rival
budgets by black, progressive and conservative Democrats,
Democratic leaders and conservative Republicans.	   As they did when Kasich
pushed the plan through his committee
last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote
on the $483 billion, five-year tax cut Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly
comparable because they cover different five-year periods.
Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses
as projected by Congress, and few Republicans would be comfortable
voting to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts over the next five
years, nearly offset by $96 billion in higher cigarette and some
business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives won a promise from GOP leaders to pursue at
least $4 billion more in debt reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have
prohibited spending any of this year's projected $27 billion
surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate $9 billion
measure financing anti-drug efforts in Colombia, U.S. troops in
Kosovo, and aid to victims of Hurricane Floyd and other domestic
disasters.
