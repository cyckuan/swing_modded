   WASHINGTON _ A top official in the Clinton administration
strongly objected Wednesday to a Republican plan that would allow
some money theoretically earmarked for Social Security to be spent
for other purposes over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee
on Social Security, a senior Democratic congressman worried aloud
that President Clinton would lure Democratic lawmakers into taking
difficult stands on Social Security and then, as he has on occasion
in the past, reverse course and leave his legislative allies
stranded politically.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers, the president's chief spokesman on Social Security, said a
plan announced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House would make it
more difficult to keep the retirement system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Under that plan, Congress could dip into the interest payments
the Treasury owes the Social Security reserves for the next two
years and use the money for tax cuts or spending on programs like
the military and education. After two years, when the operating
budget of the government is projected to start running a surplus,
no further money collected in Social Security taxes would be used
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he had ``very considerable concern'' that the plan
would give Congress ``more room for dissipating the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   By the administration's calculations, the federal budget will
have a surplus next year of $117 billion. That will result from the
government's collecting $129 billion more in Social Security taxes
than it will spend in benefits and a deficit of $12 billion in the
operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not
use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs. But he
manages this by proposing tax increases on cigarettes and other
budgetary manipulations that Congress has already rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the budgetary dispute between the administration and
Congress over how to allocate the Social Security money is a smoke
screen to mask the serious political differences over how to
strengthen the public retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The president has proposed using 62 percent of the overall
budget surplus over the next 15 years _ approximately the portion
of the surplus attributable to an excess in payroll taxes over
retirement benefits _ to shore up Social Security. Most of this
money would be used to pay down the national debt and a small
portion would be used by the government to invest in financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have not adopted a specific plan, have agreed
that 62 percent of the surplus should be set aside for Social
Security. But they want to use the money to enable workers to
invest in the stock market in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The budgetary arguments were briefly overshadowed at Wednesday's
hearing by a sharp statement by Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the
leading Democrat on the Social Security subcommittee, challenging
the president's resolve on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, whose wife worked in the White House until recently and
who himself is one of the most loyal Clinton supporters in
Congress, became frustrated when he could not get Summers to
promise that the president would go beyond his general plan and
propose specific Social Security legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't be so supportive,'' Matsui snapped, ``lest you
pull the rug out from under me.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned later, Matsui refused to elaborate. But Democratic
representatives who spoke only on the condition that they not be
identified said Matsui's challenge reflected their concern that the
president would cut a deal with Republicans after Democrats had
stuck out their necks to support him.
</P>
<P>
   In his first budget fight in 1993, Clinton did just that on a
fuel tax. Later, in the Democrats' view, the president
double-crossed them on welfare changes and the 1997 balanced-budget
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all we talk about back there,'' one Democrat said,
motioning to a private cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, said he had no
indication that Clinton would be less than firm on Social Security.
But he added, ``I agree there is a credibility problem given past
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, there was other wrangling over the
budget and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, renewed his
criticism of Clinton's proposal to allow the government to invest a
portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market. Speaking
to a subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee, Greenspan argued
that state and local government pension funds, because of political
meddling, earned lower returns than corporate pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion was challenged Wednesday by the nation's largest
public pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement
System. The fund released a study it had commissioned by Wilshire
Associates, a pension-fund consultant, which found that corporate
and public pensions funds had earned almost identical rates of
return on equities over the past 5 and 10 years.
