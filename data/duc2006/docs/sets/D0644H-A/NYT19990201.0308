<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday touted his $1.77
trillion blueprint for federal spending and its bailouts for Social
Security and Medicare as relief for Generation X, which faces the
risk of high federal taxes to subsidize the retirement of baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Fleshing out proposals for fiscal 2000 that were sketched in his
Jan. 19 State of the Union address, Clinton urged the
Republican-led Congress to begin devoting the projected $4.4
trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years to ``progressive but
prudent'' investments to enable Americans in their 20s and 30s to
meet the ``challenges of their times ... unburdened by the
unfinished business of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told an invited audience in the East Room of the White
House that it is ``profoundly important'' that Americans ``see this
budget not just as the budget that saves Social Security and
Medicare, but the budget that ensures for young Americans the same
chance ... to meet the challenges that they will have to face that
we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress denounced many provisions in the
Clinton proposal, saying that the brunt of budget surpluses should
be used for tax cuts. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V.
Domenici, R-N.M., said that ``big government has been reborn and
reinvented in this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan includes $34 billion in tax cuts over five years,
$39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and
projects a record $117 billion surplus. He seeks $82 billion in
increased taxes over the next five years, including a
55-cent-per-pack increase on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette tax would raise $53.4 billion over five years to
help pay the federal government's costs for treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the appeal of his budget proposals to young
adults shortly after former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
began her sworn testimony before House prosecutors handling the
president's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Lewinsky, 25, by name. But many of the
proposals outlined in his budget appeared designed to appeal to the
45 million Americans who were born between 1965 and 1980 _ the
so-called Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton budget would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Devote $2.7 trillion, or 62 percent of the projected $4.4
trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, to rescuing
the financially ailing Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The politically popular retirement program, created in 1935
during the depths of the Great Depression, provides $393 billion to
44 million beneficiaries each year. But the looming retirement of
the first of the 76 million post-World War II baby-boom generation
in 2011 means that receipts from payroll taxes and interest will
begin to fall short of benefit obligations for an expanding elderly
population.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his rescue plan would prolong solvency until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take care of this, then when the baby boom retires, our
children will have their incomes to invest in their lives and the
lives of our grandchildren,'' Clinton explained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces an uphill political struggle with his proposal to
invest about $700 billion of the diverted federal surplus in the
stock market to generate additional revenue for Social Security.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and GOP leaders on Capitol
Hill have voiced skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ease potential financial burdens on younger Americans by
bolstering the Medicare system that provides health care insurance
for people age 65 and older. Clinton seeks to set aside 15 percent
of the federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, or about $660
billion, to prolong the solvency of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants to permit people between ages 55 and 62 to
buy into Medicare if they lose health insurance coverage from a
private employer, as well as allow anyone between 62 and 65 to buy
into the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boost savings with a proposed Universal Savings Account (USA
Account) that would enable employees to contribute pre-tax dollars
to a self-directed retirement investment account that would be
matched on a sliding scale by the federal government. Clinton wants
to devote 11 percent of the projected $4.4 trillion surplus _ or
about $500 billion _ to pay the government's share of the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut from five to three years the amount of time that an
employee needs to become vested in an employer-matching 401(k)
program or other retirement plans to help protect younger workers
who change jobs frequently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide a $250 tax credit for parents who stay at home with
children under age 1 and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care
for dependents with long-term illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek federal subsidies to underwrite $22 billion in school
construction and modernization bonds to ease classroom
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his bid to prolong the solvency of Social Security
and Medicare would ease the financial burdens of younger Americans
by reducing the burden of financing the nation's $5.5 trillion
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government currently pays about $235 billion in
interest annually on the debt _ or about 11 cents of every tax
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget
blueprint would cut projected debt costs to just 2 cents out of
every federal tax dollar in 2014.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing the risk that the global financial crisis might
slam into the robust American economy, said reducing the long-term
financial burdens facing younger Americans will help bolster the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we're doing for our kids,'' Clinton said,
adding that his plan will ``guarantee them an economy of continuing
enduring stability and a hedge against the storms that may happen
beyond our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget proposal offers the nation's 1.4 million armed
forces an immediate 4.4 percent pay raise with additional pay hikes
over the next five years _ a White House bid to respond to
complaints from enlisted personnel between the ages of 18 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would allow students and new graduates to
deduct interest on student loans for the life of the loan _
typically 10 to 20 years _ rather than only the five years of
deductions currently allowed.

<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill voiced support and criticism of
Clinton's plan _ a road map for federal spending in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 that will be fought over by the White House and
Congress for the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., applauded Clinton for
setting aside money in the projected budget surplus for shoring up
the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert faulted Clinton for spending the rest of the
anticipated surplus on ``Washington-based programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the surplus as an overpayment by American taxpayers,''
Hastert said. ``We believe that some of this overpayment should go
back to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, slammed Clinton's
budget for using $1 trillion in projected surplus money for new
programs rather than tax cuts. Armey said he wants to use the
surplus to cut every tax _ except the Social Security payroll tax _
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to see you and me overcharged for each of the
next 15 years, but he doesn't want to give us a refund,'' Armey
said. ``It belongs to the American people. We earned it, we paid
it. And it's ours.''
