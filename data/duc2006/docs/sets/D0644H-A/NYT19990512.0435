 &HT;    Resignation of Treasury chief brings small blip
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stock market shrugged off news Wednesday that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is resigning, with the Dow Jones
industrial average recouping most of the 213 points it lost in
early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished down 25.78 points at 11,000.37, but the broader
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 0.6 percent to set a record at
1,364. The Nasdaq composite finished up 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction on Wall Street was attributed partly to the
uncertainty about economic policy under Rubin's deputy and
designated successor, Lawrence Summers. The news also provided an
excuse to sell for investors already worried about the market's
historically high level, said money manager Phillip M. Larkins of
Legacy South in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason for the early stumble may have been due to
Rubin's relationship with Wall Street. Rubin is not only a Wall
Street alumnus _ he headed the Goldman Sachs investment banking
firm _ but like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is well
respected there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin is probably the only person who could take Greenspan's
job without upsetting the market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director
of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The market's subsequent rebound came after investors had time to
reflect on three things, Larkins suggested:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin had indicated many times he would like to step down in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think people came to a conclusion that the worst
of the global turmoil is behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's been fairly well assumed that Larry Summers would
replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see him go, but the market was anticipating it,''
Larkins added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot that has happened on his watch, and most of
it has been good,'' noted economist Mark Vitner of Charlotte,
N.C.-based First Union bank. He cited the federal budget surplus
and Rubin's handling of international financial crises, first in
Mexico and then in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very protective. He was very, very determined that
financial crisis overseas would not leak back to the United
States,'' Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Summers has been the Treasury secretary's
``right-hand man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely to represent that much of a change,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of viewing the news negatively, as the market did
initially, a closer look might lead to a more optimistic outlook,
Vitner said, echoing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may come to the conclusion that Rubin thought the world
economy is in good enough shape that he could step off the stage,''
Vitner said.
