<HEADLINE> End of U.S. Debt Seen conceivable </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is on the threshold of a  
truly remarkable turnaround in financial fortunes: the tantalizing 
prospect that the booming economy could make the federal government 
debt-free in just 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And it could happen, for only the second time in the nation's  
history, with seemingly no heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
	If politicians simply leave current policies alone, the  
president's Office of Management and Budget projects the $3.7 
trillion debt held by the public will be wiped out in 2014. The 
Congressional Budget Office is even more optimistic, predicting 
publicly held debt could be gone by 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	With politicians eager for tax cuts and more spending, no one  
expects lawmakers actually to leave well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress over the long haul abhors surpluses. They will be  
dispensed in some fashion, either as tax cuts or increased 
spending,'' predicts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, both President Clinton and the Republicans who  
control Congress are pledging to use the bulk of future surpluses -- 
roughly two-thirds -- to reduce the national debt as a way to shore 
up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics note that leaves the other third of the $4.5 trillion  
in projected future surpluses for spending increases or tax cuts. 
And that means both parties are, in essence, already running behind 
the debt paydown schedule that would occur if there are no changes 
in policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2014, the year the OMB projects that debt held by the public  
could be eliminated with no changes in policy, Clinton's budget 
instead sees a publicly held debt of $1.17 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is even worse if the total national debt is  
considered. That figure now is $5.6 trillion -- a total that 
includes the $3.7 trillion in debt held by the public and the $1.9 
trillion in debt held by the government in trust funds, primarily 
Social Security's. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's complex plan to shore up Social Security, the  
government IOUs held by the retirement program would actually 
increase -- an approach Republicans insist amounts to double 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years, the national debt under Clinton's plan,  
including the extra IOUs for Social Security, will grow to $6.8 
trillion, compared to $5.9 trillion under the OMB forecast with no 
policy changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration defends the extra IOUs as a way to lock in,  
for Social Security, benefits of paying down the public debt. 
Private economists generally are neutral, arguing that because the 
trust funds exist only as bookkeeping entries, it's the debt held 
by the public that actually matters for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On that point, economists generally give the administration high  
marks for using the bulk of the surpluses to pay down the public 
debt, and thus put the government on a sounder footing to meet 
future retirement demands of 73 million baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told Congress  
the best use for surpluses would be shrinking the national debt, 
thus freeing money for investment by private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``By wiping out the debt held by the public, we increase  
national savings, keep interest rates low, build our capital stock 
and fuel long-term growth,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national 
economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also stresses that reducing the  
public debt will trim the government's interest bill. Because of 
skyrocketing deficits during the Reagan years -- overall, the debt 
held by the public quadrupled in two decades -- interest is now the 
government's third-biggest expense, behind Social Security and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest payments accounted for 15 cents of every budget dollar  
in 1997. In all, they totaled $243 billion, which bought not a 
single battleship nor paper clip. Interest payments this year will 
amount to 11 percent of the budget. Clinton projects they will drop 
to 2 percent in 2014 before disappearing in 2018, the year he says 
the public debt will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO forecasts public debt gone by 2012. But it also notes  
that era will be short-lived as escalating payments to retirees put 
the nation back in debt by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, all long-range forecasts need to be taken with a  
grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, with a good economy, we have had unrelentingly good  
news, but that could change quickly,'' former CBO director Robert 
Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the experience of President Andrew Jackson, the only  
president to eliminate the debt, should also serve as a cautionary 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1832 campaign for the White House, Jackson called the  
debt a ``national curse'' and in 1835 fulfilled his pledge to wipe 
it out, creating a surplus of $440,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before he left office, the debt was rising again as the  
country entered a six-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paying off the national debt doesn't automatically mean  
economic good times,'' historian John Steele Gordon said. ``After 
Jackson did it, the country went into the longest recession in its 
history.''
