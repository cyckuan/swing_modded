<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns Lawmakers Against Incautious Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically cautioned lawmakers Wednesday
against spending projected federal budget surpluses that he said
may not materialize.
</P>
<P>
"I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs
that are put in place now strike me as risking the possibility
that we may be wrong on this surplus," said Greenspan. "And all I
say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until
we have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal
government accounts is."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made the remarks in an appearance before the Senate
Banking Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual economic report
to Congress. He gave similar testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also repeated sentiments Wednesday that put financial
markets on notice last week to expect further interest rate
increases if the economy continues to grow at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still
largely at bay, Greenspan said tight labor markets and a continued
consumer spending boom present potential price pressures too great
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
Many private economists are looking for at least two more
quarter-point rate increases from the central bank's next meetings
in March and May.
</P>
<P>
Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75
percent in four quarter-point moves, the last one occurring on
February 2.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that
have overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in
recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet.
Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay
down the national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I'
ve argued that we should allow the surpluses run and... reduce the
debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses
are too great, the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut
over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's final budget projects that the 3.7-
trillion-U.S.-dollar publicly held portion of the 5.7-trillion-
dollar national debt could be eliminated by 2013, making the
government free of debt to the public for the first time since
1835.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also proposed extensive new government programs,
however, including an expansion of Medicare to include
prescription drug coverage. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing
for large tax cuts.
