<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Don't Spend Surplus Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically
cautioned lawmakers today against spending projected federal budget surpluses
that he said may not occur.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put
in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this
surplus," said Greenspan. "And all I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to
delay for a while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the
federal government accounts is."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was answering questions in an appearance before the Senate Banking
Committee to deliver the Fed's semiannual report to Congress. He gave similar
testimony in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan also repeated sentiments today that put financial markets on
notice last week to expect further interest rate increases if the economy
continues to grow at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still largely at bay,
Greenspan said tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending boom
present potential price pressures too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
	   If Fed policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, "then we are like
the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming
into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have
turned at least partially in order to come into ... a soft landing," Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many private economists are looking for at least two more quarter-point rate
increases from the central bank's next meetings in March and May.
</P>
<P>
	   Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent in four quarter-point
moves, the last one occurring Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said the reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that have
overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in recent years are not
entirely understood by economists yet. Therefore, it is difficult to predict
whether they will persist.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the
national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Until surplus projections are more certain, Greenspan said, "I've argued
that we should allow the surpluses run and ... reduce the debt outstanding."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great,
the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's final budget projects that the $3.7 trillion publicly
held portion of the $5.7 trillion national debt could be eliminated by 2013,
making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since 1835,
when Andrew Jackson was president.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has also proposed extensive new government programs, however,
including an expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage.
Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately today, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said wiping out
the national debt would not harm the ability of the Federal Reserve to fight
inflation through its management of short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Meyer said
the central bank, which uses its holdings of Treasury securities to implement
changes in interest rates, will be able to adapt to a world where the level of
those securities is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "Declining Treasury debt does not pose any insurmountable long-term problem
for the Federal Reserve," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed manages the nation's money supply by buying and selling Treasury
securities. If it wants to increase the money supply and thus lower short-term
interest rates, it buys Treasury securities held by banks, providing money that
the banks can use to make more loans to businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Fed wants to shrink the money supply and raise interest rates, it
sells Treasury securities to the banks in return for a portion of the banks'
cash reserves. The banks have less money available to make loans and interest
rates increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said that while the central bank now only buys and sells Treasury
securities to expand and shrink the money supply, it could easily shift to other
types of bonds such as those sold by state and local governments or even debt
sold by other nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "A decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately
retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this
option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy," Meyer said.
