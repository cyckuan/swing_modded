<HEADLINE> White House OMB Chief: 1997 Deficit Down Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Franklin Raines said today
that the U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 1997 will be
below 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Raines made the remarks at a meeting of the U.S. National
Association of Manufacturers. It was the latest in a string of
estimates in which U.S. government budget analysts have lowered
their expectations on the deficit for the fiscal 1997 which ended
on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration and U.S. Congressional budget officials
had said the 1997 deficit would be about 125 billion dollars when
the fiscal year started. Just last month, the OMB said it expected
a 37 billion-dollar shortfall for fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office also forecast earlier this
month that the deficit would be 23 billion dollars in last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The real U.S. federal budget deficit of 1997 will be announced
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Raines also said that there was no indication that the U.S.
federal budget will be balanced in 1998 and cautioned the U.S.
Congress against planning new spending or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Both the White House and the U.S. Congress have said that they
expected a higher deficit in 1998 than the year of 1997 because of
the balanced-budget package which enacted last August. Many of the
tax cuts in that agreement take effect this year but few of the
spending cuts do.
