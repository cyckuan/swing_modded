&HT;        PA LAWMAKERS DISAGREE WITH GREENSPAN'S PREDICTION TAX HIKES
OR BENEFIT CUTS ARE NECESSARY TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 -- Several Pennsylvania lawmakers disagreed
with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning Thursday
that the only way to save Social Security is to raise taxes or cut
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said there are a host of options for
saving the program if all of the federal budget surplus is put
toward bolstering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are projecting a very substantial surplus for many years
into the future,'' Specter said. ``It is my thinking that we don't
need to have any additional taxes, but can make Social Security
sound with that surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that
President Clinton's plan to save Social Security is a ``major step
in the right direction,'' but tax hikes or benefit cuts are
inevitable to make it solvent.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Greenspan was correct that more work
needed to be done to save Social Security, adding that Clinton
would be working with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tax hikes or benefit cuts won't be necessary if Clinton allows
for individuals to set up personal investment accounts, said a
spokesman for Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``He thinks individuals
should invest directly in the stock market instead of the
government making those choices,'' Santorum spokesman Robert
Traynham said. ``It's Big Brother all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also resurrected concerns he expressed last week about
Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the federal budget
surplus in the stock market. He said it would be nearly impossible
for investments of the money to be protected from political
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton said he wants to use
60 percent of the federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years
to shore up the system that pays benefits to America's retirees.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of that money would be invested in the stock
market. An independent board would make the decisions about
investing. Clinton also proposed that 11 percent of the surplus be
set aside to create new private retirement accounts with a variety
of investment options individuals could choose among.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been grappling with how to prevent Social
Security from going bankrupt, which experts say will happen in 2032
unless it is reformed. As early as 2013, the system will be paying
out more in benefits to retirees than it takes in from taxes on
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, said he had serious doubts about
investing Social Security dollars in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only risky but President Clinton's plan also raises
many difficult questions -- should the government decide which
stocks to buy or not buy, when to buy and when to sell, whether to
invest in defense companies or tobacco companies or international
companies doing business in say, China?'' Murtha said. ``Who's
going to make these decisions?''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, Santorum and Murtha said they were pleased that Social
Security was at the forefront of the national agenda, because the
issue is especially important in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   While 12.6 percent of the nation is 65 years of age or older,
Pennsylvania has 15.9 percent, the third highest percentage of
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Census data, which includes Cambria and Somerset counties in the
Johnstown regional count, reported that last year 18.7 percent of
the population in the Johnstown area is at least 65 years old.
