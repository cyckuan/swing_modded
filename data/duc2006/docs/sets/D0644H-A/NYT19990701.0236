   WASHINGTON _ Armed with new forecasts of a growing budget
surplus, House Republican leaders unveiled a tax-cut package
Thursday that would lower federal income rates across-the-board and
give married couples a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use a major portion of the available surplus to reduce
taxes on all Americans, whose income taxes have produced this
surplus,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, the panel that writes federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   While Archer didn't provide specific details, he said the tax
cut-package he and his staff are drafting will include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A broad-based tax cut that will benefit all federal income tax
payers. One proposal includes lowering the 15 percent federal
income tax bracket to 13.5 percent. All taxpayers have some income
taxed at the 15 percent tax rate so a tax cut in that bracket would
benefit everyone.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the so-called marriage penalty created by
present law that results in two-income married couples often paying
more in federal taxes than if they had remained single. This
reflects the fact that the couple's combined income is taxed at a
higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cut in capital gains taxes and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase in the current annual $2,000 limit in
contributions that can be made to Individual Retirement Accounts.
The top limit may be raised to as much as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow self-employed people to deduct the cost of health
insurance from their federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican drum beat for tax cuts picked up tempo as the
Congressional Budget Office projected the federal budget surplus
would total $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. Earlier this week
the White House's Office of Management and Budget forecast similar
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Archer and the House Republican leadership to enact
a $1 trillion tax cut over 10-years met resistance from the party's
moderates in both the House and Senate, not to mention Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many moderate House Republicans prefer to stick with the smaller
$778 billion tax-cut plan over 10 years outlined in the budget plan
passed by Congress earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller tax-cut plan was based on CBO's earlier forecast
that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to $1.78 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Budget surplus projections from the CBO and OMB have grown in
recent months as the U.S. economy continues to outperform
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said the $778 billion package is
large enough and that the rest of the surplus should go to other
government programs like Medicare, veterans health benefits and
elementary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for most government programs like education and health
care has been frozen or cut as part of a White House and
congressional agreement in 1997 to balance the federal budget. But
now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many
Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said so many House Republicans have balked at the $1
trillion tax proposal that the leadership may have to stick with
the $778 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and President Clinton think both plans are too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the
Republican tax cuts plans ``totally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really left out important priorities that we ought
to be dealing with,'' Gephardt said, referring to education and
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats favor a less expensive tax cut, similar
to the one outlined earlier this year by Clinton. That proposal
would cost about $300 billion over 10 years and include such
targeted tax cuts as a $500 tax credit for parents who stay at home
to care for infants and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care for
a disabled child or parent.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic
Council, said the Republicans' tax cut plan would take money that
could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when
the large baby boom generation begins retiring in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Under current projections, Medicare is projected to go broke in
2015 and if nothing is done to Social Security, it will be unable
to pay full benefits beginning in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said parts of the Republican plan such as the capital
gains tax cut is skewed toward people with higher incomes who can
afford to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tax cut that helps more moderate families is a higher
priority,'' he said. ``We have no intention of supporting a new
capital gains tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts are likely to be a continuing topic of discussion
between the White House and Capitol Hill this year because
lawmakers from both parties say some type of tax cut will likely be
approved and signed into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly some momentum building for a middle-income
tax cut,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``The fight is
becoming not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the
dividend.''
