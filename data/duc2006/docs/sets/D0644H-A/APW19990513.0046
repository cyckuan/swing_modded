<HEADLINE> Rubin: A Wall Street Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin spent much of his life  
speculating what the stock market would do. He was good at it and 
made $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to Washington, Rubin did essentially the same  
thing, speculating that if President Clinton would balance the 
budget, he would be rewarded with a booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of many, that argument caught Clinton's ear.  
</P>
<P>
	And in the six years since, first as a top economic adviser and  
since 1995 as the Treasury secretary, Rubin has gained much credit 
-- in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan -- for the policies of spending restraint that kept 
interest rates low, Wall Street booming and many Americans raking 
in money. That prosperity, in turn, helped smooth Clinton's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans wouldn't recognize the slight, silver-haired man  
in his investment banker pinstripes. But Clinton, many Republicans 
and especially Wall Street have always given Rubin considerable 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of  
the Clinton-Gore administration in check,'' said House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Clinton put it as he announced Rubin's departure  
Wednesday, ``Everybody always believed that as long as he was 
secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, for years reporters and Wall Street brokers joked how  
the market might sink the day Rubin finally left. He had long 
``pined for private life,'' Clinton noted. The secretary's wife, 
Judith, never moved to Washington, and Rubin, 60, stayed in a hotel 
near the White House, flying home to New York City every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The market did indeed drop more than 200 points on Wednesday  
morning but quickly recovered, largely perhaps because Greenspan, 
73, still has another year as Federal Reserve chairman and may seek 
another four-year term after that. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Rubin has spent much of the past year grooming his  
deputy, former Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, sending him to 
Capitol Hill and around the world when Asia's economy crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Rubin's close relationship with Greenspan that  
mattered most. Rubin set an early and ironclad rule that no one in 
the Clinton administration could publicly criticize the Fed 
chairman. As Greenspan and the Fed pursued policies that led to low 
inflation, even Republicans were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving Greenspan alone -- they do get credit for that,'' said  
GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who otherwise bitterly 
criticized Rubin and Summers' handling of the Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans did fight with Rubin over the 1997 government  
shutdown and his handling of the Asian crisis. But most considered 
him ``a strong and sometimes solitary voice within the Clinton 
administration for open markets and fiscal discipline,'' said House 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also frustrated some Democrats, especially early on, when  
Labor Secretary Robert Reich and others complained the 
administration too heavily favored business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the  
House Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed 
ties on Capitol Hill when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and 
negotiate directly with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God during all these times we knew we had someone we  
could depend on,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also pushed often for more private investment in inner  
city neighborhoods, another position Clinton embraced. Yet that 
work never gained him the attention that the economy's boom did. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what he will do when he returns to private life. He  
is viewed as a possible candidate for the Fed chairmanship if 
Greenspan should retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who has two grown sons, put his own millions in a blind  
trust and became a retired partner at Goldman, Sachs during his 
government years. He entered an arrangement where he could neither 
profit nor suffer from the firm's performance, Treasury officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Goldman went public, selling millions of shares in an  
initial public offering that gained $3.66 billion, the 
second-largest in history. Some senior and retired partners made 
millions. Rubin, under his arrangement, missed out.
