<HEADLINE> Public Order Improving, General Situation Still Stark: Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) - A senior Chinese lawmaker said
here today that public security in some areas has taken a turn for
the better thanks to comprehensive public-order regulations, but
the general situation is still disturbing.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, China's top legislature, made this statement
after concluding a legislative inspection tour to Hainan, Jilin
and Jiangsu provinces, and several municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the ongoing session of the NPC Standing
Committee, he said local governments are basically maintaining
social stability and causing people to feel safer by employing
measures for years to mobilize community forces and help the
police prevent and crack down on crime.
</P>
<P>
"Especially in coastal areas where there used to be quite a
number of public security problems, the general security situation
is obviously better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without the comprehensive measures taken these years, Cao
added, the present security situation would be "much worse".
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, crime rates are still on rise; the problems of
murder, robbery, explosions, and theft are prominent;
prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist
despite repeated police raids; and gang crimes, juvenile
delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are increasing,
according to the senior lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police have intensified their fight against criminal
gangs and have smashed many in the past two years, but the public
reports that gangs are still growing in number and influence, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security say that in the
first six months this year, police nationwide handled 833,000
criminal cases, up 21.6 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Cao proposed several solutions for the worsening situation:
</P>
<P>
-- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising
crime rates;
</P>
<P>
-- The community-level security network must be spread and
instituted all across the country, as surveys have found that
those places with poor security are also lax in law enforcement;
</P>
<P>
-- And, most important, leaders at all levels must first
become aware of the present situation and remain assiduous in the
comprehensive management of public security.
