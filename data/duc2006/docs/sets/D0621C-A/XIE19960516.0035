BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have solved a
significant number of cases involving major criminal offenses,
since the start of a nationwide anti-crime campaign on April 28.
</P>
<P>
These included apprehending six people who were on the Public
Security Ministry's most-wanted list, arresting some escaped
criminals, and confiscating a large number of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, police in east China's Fujian Province
have cracked a kidnapping case that involved a Chinese-American
gang and one from Hong Kong, and a total of 1.3 million yuan (some
160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces joined hands in work
on a drug smuggling case that involved a total of 600 kg of
heroin. Thirty-nine drug traffickers were arrested and ten
vehicles used to ferry the drugs were seized.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hunan Province, an eight-member gang of
thieves who were connected with 141 thefts involving 370,000
yuan-worth of stolen articles, has been put out.
</P>
<P>
Police in northeast China's Liaoning Province arrested a person
who had killed and wounded three victims and been at large for ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to stop the manufacture and sale of firearms have been
increased because of the obvious harm to society.
</P>
<P>
In east and northeast China's Shandong, Liaoning, and
Heilongjiang provinces, more than 8,000 illegal firearms have been
confiscated in each of the provinces, and the numbers for Hebei,
Hubei and Shanxi provinces are more than 3,000 each.
</P>
<P>
A number of criminals have voluntarily surrendered to police as
well. Over 600 escapees had given themselves up in central China's
Henan Province, by May 6, and the number for Hunan Province stood
at 490.
</P>
<P>
A senior police official attributes these achievements in the
nationwide crackdown on major crimes to the positive attitude and
participation of ordinary citizens everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, 80 percent of the criminal cases
cracked in east China's Shandong Province, in fact, were the
result of tips provided by citizens, and 45 percent of the
criminal arrests came about because of help from the people.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official pointed out recently that government at
all levels should take this opportunity to improve rules and
regulations, management, and precautionary measures in order to
make the social order much better.
