CHINESE POLICE END THE REIGN OF `BIG SPENDER' AND HIS MOB

   GUANGZHOU, China _ On a back street in this mangy city, where
thick steam bubbles off woks at outdoor food stalls and mah-jongg
tiles can be heard clacking late into the evening, a gang of Hong
Kong mobsters often met in a well-guarded house to plot their most
lucrative capers.
</P>
<P>
   The gang got its start years ago by robbing jewelry stores in
Hong Kong, then retreating across the Chinese border to hide here
because the local police were either too inept or corrupt to care.
The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by
kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and
getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's leader, known as ``Big Spender'' for his habit of
dropping a million dollars a shot at a favorite casino in the
nearby Portuguese colony of Macau, seemed to typify the excesses of
organized crime that flourished in southern China in step with an
economic boom in the 1990s. Big Spender, whose real name is Cheung
Tze-keung, may have been the most wanted man in Hong Kong, but in
this part of China he became a folk hero for his apparent
invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after a series of brazen robberies, murders and
kidnappings, Cheung's gang was officially pronounced dead. China's
national police seized 32 people they described as his accomplices.
They also seized nearly $5 million in cash, 11 luxury cars and a
cache of explosives and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung was not only in custody, police said, but had confessed
to the gang's role in murder, robbery, kidnapping and smuggling
explosives. What Cheung actually said, and how he pleads, will
probably remain as secret as other case files in China.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious
evolution of lawlessness that straddles the border between Hong
Kong and Guangdong province, an area with a rich history of secret
societies, pirates and criminal intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a sign that Asia's mounting economic woes are
hurting criminals, too. More likely, it is a kind of poetic justice
for a singularly talented gangster and his crew, who had a
remarkably long run before getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Cheung took advantage of the wide cracks that exist
between distinctly separate law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong
and Guangdong, which have long mistrusted each other's methods and
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back and forth over the border as it suited him, Cheung
was able to capitalize on the poor communication between police on
each side. Even since Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule last year,
cooperation between the police forces has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the tables have turned on Cheung. This time he is
likely to fare worse from the cross-border confusion, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Hong Kong police ask for the return of a Hong Kong
citizen who commits crimes in Hong Kong but is arrested in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Hong Kong police have raised no objection to
seeing Cheung's case handled in Guangdong, where being charged is a
virtual guarantee of being found guilty and where the penalty for
any serious violent crime is usually a swift execution. Were Cheung
to be tried in Hong Kong, he would have at least have a chance at
acquittal, a trick he pulled off once before on an armed robbery
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Xingfeng, director of the criminal investigation bureau of
Beijing's Ministry of Public Security, said Cheung's major crimes
were planned in Guangzhou, so his case will be handled by the
Guangdong provincial authorities. Many of the plans were made,
Zhang said, in one of 50 properties owned by Cheung and his gang.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to murder and kidnapping, Zhang also said, the gang
had smuggled more than 1,500 pounds of explosives from Guangdong
into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were
from mainland China, Zhang said. Just over half were arrested here
on July 22; the rest were apprehended on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the arrests were made in the mainland after six months
of investigations carried out with the support and cooperation of
the Hong Kong police,'' Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheung himself was actually apprehended in January, after a
tip from an informer led police into a long cat-and-mouse chase
that ended in Jiangmen, a city south of here, where Cheung was
caught trying to escape in a taxi cab.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the image of the hard-nosed, tough-jawed outlaw that
dominates a popular genre of Hong Kong gangster movies, Cheung is a
slight man with a gently protruding forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently enjoying the image of fancy cars and fast women that
comes with his territory, Cheung reveled in his aura of
invincibility in 1995, when Hong Kong's High Court acquitted him on
a technicality from an earlier conviction for armed robbery of an
armored truck at Kai Tak Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He had served 18 months in prison, apparently leaving him with
such serious grievances against the prison authorities that his
gang was suspected when a bulldozer suddenly demolished a prison
guard house one night. The next month, the home of Hong Kong's
secretary for security was fire-bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong newspapers also reported that Cheung was behind a
bizarre plan to kidnap Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, as
a way to win the release of a fellow gangster, Yip Kai-foon. The
plan was apparently foiled.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the gang's crimes, the most astonishing one was
undoubtedly the kidnapping of Victor Li, the son of Li Ka-shing,
Hong Kong's most powerful businessman, in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearful of more kidnapping attempts, neither father
nor son has ever spoken publicly about the kidnapping. Yet Hong
Kong media have reported that the Li family paid a ransom of one
billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $125 million, without telling the
Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police confirmed Cheung's role in the kidnapping and the
$125 million extortion. Police also argued that the crime was
planned in Guangzhou, justifying a prosecution here, even though it
was carried out in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, as the kidnapping's mastermind, awarded himself 40
percent of the take, or roughly $50 million, and split the other
$75 million among nine associates, a Hong Kong newspaper reported
</P>
<P>
   In a second high-profile kidnapping in September 1997, Cheung
took half of the $80 million extorted from the family of another
property tycoon, Walter Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese accounts of Cheung's downfall suggested that it grew out
of the cooperation of a gang member. The Hong Kong media have also
reported that some Hong Kong property tycoons had quietly expressed
their concern about the danger of kidnapping in Hong Kong by
cross-border gangs to China's President, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cheung's arrest came about by pressure on the police
from Jiang, by a rare case of successful cooperation between
Guangdong and Hong Kong police, or simply by a lucky break, may
never become public. But Big Spender's days are over.
