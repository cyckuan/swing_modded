<HEADLINE> Judicial Guarantees for Human Rights Strengthened in China: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A white paper released by the
State Council Press Office today says that, during the past year
and more, China has taken many measures to strengthen the judicial
guarantee for human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law,
promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the
Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial
guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
It has cracked down on serious criminal offenses in accordance
with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human rights and
safety of lives and property, it states.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched,
according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal
offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides,
robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with
emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with
gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by
rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout the country
sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously endangered
public security by committing crimes of violence, crimes involving
the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The severe crackdown on crimes has safeguarded social stability
and the human rights of the people all over the country, and won
the heartfelt support of the general public, the paper claims.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that in March of 1997, China's Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress made amendments to the
Criminal Law enacted in 1979. The amended Criminal Law has 452
articles, an increase of 260 over the previous 192 articles.
</P>
<P>
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic
principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law,"
"equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate
with the crime."
</P>
<P>
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if an
act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law," "all
criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that "the
severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's
crime and due criminal liabilities."
</P>
<P>
These three principles have further improved China's principle
of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the
protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants, the white
paper states.
</P>
<P>
It points out that China has paid close attention to
standardizing the practice of administrative and law-enforcement
departments, so as to protect the citizens' legitimate rights from
any infringement.
</P>
<P>
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the
Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in
March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative
Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of
administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of employees in the lawyers profession
national exceeded 100,000 in 1996, who have become a major force
in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens,
the white paper says.
