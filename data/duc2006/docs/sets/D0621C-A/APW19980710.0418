Chinese police chief refutes reports of crime mob cooperation

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Accusing foreign media of plotting to disrupt
relations with Macau, a Chinese police chief has denied allegations
his officers are linked to a wave of gang-related violence in the
Portuguese enclave.
	   Chen Shaoji, chief of police in southern Guangdong province,
said the foreign reports about reputed Macau crime boss Wan
Kuok-koi sought to give the ``mistaken impression'' that his
officers supported criminal gangs in Macau.
	   Chen said the reports ``sought to drench Guangdong police
leaders in dirty water,'' the official Yangcheng Evening News
reported in its Thursday edition.
	   Guangdong police are not allowed contacts with foreign crime
mobs ``except for work requirements,'' the newspaper paraphrased
Chen as saying.
	   Wan, also known as ``Broken Tooth'' Koi, was arrested in May
after a bomb exploded beneath the car of Dr. Antonio Marques
Baptista, director of Macau's Judicial Police.
	   The bombing was part of a wave of violence in Macau, off
Guangdong's southeast coast. Three Macau government employees,
including the No. 3 official in the gambling inspection agency,
have been killed since March.
	   The violence is believed to be part of gang warfare over payoffs
from Macau's legal casinos and has strained relations between
Chinese and Portuguese officials preparing for China's takeover of
the colony on Dec. 20, 1999.
	   Chen, the police chief, said that by blaming the Macau violence
on Guangdong police, media reports about Koi were trying to
``create suspicions between Guangdong and Macau police, causing
chaos,'' the newspaper said. He did not say which media
organizations made the reports.
	   ``These people's plots will absolutely never prevail,'' Chen
said.
