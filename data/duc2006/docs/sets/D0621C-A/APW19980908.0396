	   MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior
police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said.
	   The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the
first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to
punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
	   Witnesses said a police officer's car exploded first. When
police and journalists gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb
apparently hidden in a motorcycle parked nearby exploded and
injured the crowd at around 2 a.m.
	   TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for
help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another
explosion. Police said the second bomb was believed to have been
set off by remote control.
	   The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained
hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday. Police said the injured
officers were members of the judiciary and security units.
	   Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions. But
police said the two incidents were probably not related.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the
explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said
Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the
population and the territory's stability.''
	   Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but
the motive was not yet known. They said they were searching for two
men, both aged 30.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Macau
to take tougher acts against crime lest the violence jeopardize the
Portuguese colony's smooth return to Beijing next year.
	   ``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will
conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take
further, effective measures to recover sound public security,'' Zhu
said.
	   Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed
shock and anger. The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong
statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to
injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. The
enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to
Chinese rule in December 1999.
