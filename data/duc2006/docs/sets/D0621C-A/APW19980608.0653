	   MACAU'S Judicial Police on Sunday announced the arrest of three
alleged 14K triad members, among them two women said to be ``very
close'' to the gang's detained reputed leader, Wan Kuok-koi.
	   The three were identified as Wong Tat-hou, an alleged gang
leader; Wong Wan-wa, who is widely known by her Cantonese nickname
Fei Mui or Fat Woman; and Lam Iok-im, who is known by her nickname
Dai Ka Che or Big Sister.
	   Macau's district court yesterday ordered the pre-trial detention
of the two women on preliminary charges of criminal association.
	   Both women were taken under police guard from the district court
building on the peninsula to the central prison on Coloane island.
	   A police source said Wong Tat-hou was facing possible charges of
organised crime membership, casino loansharking and blackmail.
	   Wong is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
	   A source recalled that police last year found a huge amount of
cigarettes smuggled from the mainland in a house on Coloane island
owned by Wong Tat-hou.
	   On Saturday the police arrested an illegal Chinese immigrant
surnamed Ho, suspected of kidnapping and extortion allegedly
committed between 1995 and 1996, and a Thai national working as a
bouncer in the Heavy Club discotheque, which is reportedly owned by
Wan.
	   The Thai national, whose name was not released by police,
allegedly carried an explosive device at the time of his arrest.
	   Wan has been in pre-trial detention at Coloane prison since 4
May by order of the district court. He was arrested on 1 May,
several hours after a bomb destroyed the car of Judicial Police
Director Antonio Marques Baptista.
	   But Wan has been charged only with being a triad member, not
with the bomb attack on the police chief's car.
	   As part of a major crackdown on organised crime, Macau has set
up a special taskforce within the public prosecutor's office and
hired half a dozen criminologists from Lisbon.
	   During a visit to Lisbon last month, Macau's governor, general
Vasco Rocha Vieira, called on China to be ``more rigorous'' in
controlling its borders with Macau.
	   China has pledged it will increase its anti-crime cross-border
co-operation with Macau in the run-up to the enclave's reversion to
Chinese administration in December next year.
