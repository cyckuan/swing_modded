VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to strengthen
cooperation with other countries and international organizations
in combating and preventing organized transnational crime, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's deputy minister of justice, Zhang Geng, made the
remarks in a speech at the Sixth Session of the Commission on
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese government appreciates the efforts
by the United Nations in crime prevention and criminal justice and
has taken an active part in U.N. activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to strengthen cooperation with other governments
and international organizations and make our contributions to the
joint efforts in combating and preventing organized transnational
crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement
authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving
killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs
which entered China from overseas.
</P>
<P>
They also assisted police authorities of other countries in
tracking down and arresting members of criminal gangs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to
enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering,
terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and
environment-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The amended penal code will play a greater role in combating
transnational crime after it comes into force on October 1, 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China has signed 32 judicial assistance
agreements with 25 countries and extradition agreements with six
countries, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also cooperated with other countries with which no
agreements have been signed on a case by case basis in the
principle of mutual benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the Chinese government is ready to expand its
cooperation with other countries, including signing more
agreements, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty, judicial independence and dignity.
