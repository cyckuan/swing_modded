<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Five leaders of three
hooligan gangs have been executed in China, Liu Jiachen, vice
president of the country's Supreme People's Court, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The executions were carried out in Shangqiu of central China's
Henan Province, in Nanping of east China's Fujian Province and in
Xianyang of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, yesterday and
today.
</P>
<P>
The five criminals were sentenced to death for committing such
serious crimes as hooliganism, killing, theft and harming
individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Some hooligan gangs are well organized, having some
characteristics of sinister gangs of the underworld, which are
doing serious harm to society. It will be the focus of the
crackdown against crimes in the next stage," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving
criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China
in recent times.
</P>
<P>
Usually they have the characteristics of large gang members,
active in large areas, committing crimes frequently and doing
serious harm to society, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on
wiping out those endangering social security and public order. The
crackdown against serious crime since April has effectively
contained criminal activities and won widespread support from
people.
