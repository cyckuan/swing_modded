<HEADLINE> Survey: China Serious about Public Security, Situation Disturbing-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent internal shake-up inside judiciaries and their
efforts to ensure justice have also been fruitful, and have won
applause from the public, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
However, the present security situation is still "rather
serious," legislators said.
</P>
<P>
They said criminal rates are rising; the problems of murder,
robbery, explosion, thefts are prominent; prostitution, gambling
and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police
raids; gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated
by migrants are sharply increasing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police have intensified their fights against criminal
gangs and smashed many since 1996, but the public have reported
that such gangs are still spreading in number and influence, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 60 percent of suspected criminals
landing in the hands of police are now minors.
</P>
<P>
Inspection teams also proposed several solutions for the
worsening situation. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising
crime rates;
</P>
<P>
-- The community-level security network must be spread and
instituted all across the country, because surveys have found
those places with poor security are also lax in enforcing this
system;
</P>
<P>
-- And, most importantly, leaders at all levels must first
realize the present situation and never slacken their work of
comprehensive management of public security.
