NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Procurators, justices and
crime prevention officials from 28 Asian countries gathered here
on Tuesday to seek improvement of mutual cooperation in their
fight against crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Seventh World
Conference of Asia Crime Prevention Foundation (ACPF), Deputy
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China
Liang Guoqing called for enhancing cooperation among Asian
countries to fight crimes and set up a crime prevention regime.
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the theme of Effective Regional
Cooperation in Crime Prevention and Crime Justice in the next
millennium, is scheduled to discuss and foster strategies and
viable approaches on crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
With the world moving toward multi-polarization and integration
and exchanges among countries on the increase, Liang said, crime
has also become international in nature.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries are faced with the common challenge of
combating criminals who flee from one country to another and gang
up with local criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, it is imperative to enhance cooperation
among countries so as to set up a crime prevention regime.
</P>
<P>
He informed the delegates that China has signed legal
assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition treaties
with 10 countries. China is ready to exchange experience in
preventing and penalizing crimes with all countries, especially
those in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang also gave a brief account of the procuratorate system in
China and the practice and experience of Chinese procurators in
the field of crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Indian Law Minister Ram Jethamalani said
New Delhi favors creating international pressure against countries
which give credence and shelter to criminals and various groups
indulging in violence, arson and other unlawful activities.
</P>
<P>
"You can not fight crime at international and global level if a
criminal of one society becomes an honorable guest elsewhere and
is extended best of hospitality," Jethamalani said.
</P>
<P>
Without naming any country, the minister said perpetrators of
crime should not be given "shelter" in any country.
</P>
<P>
ACPF, a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit
organization founded in 1982, strives to promote sustainable
development, peace and stability in Asia and the world through
mutual cooperation and more effective crime prevention, criminal
justice policies and practices.
