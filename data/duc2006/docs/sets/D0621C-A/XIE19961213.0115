<HEADLINE> Chinese Crime-Stoppers Show Draws Large Number Of Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thursday was the final day of
a 43-day exhibition providing information on China's "Strike Hard"
crime-fighting campaign that has attracted some 450,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The show, which was held in a military museum in Beijing, was
the biggest and longest show on crime ever held in China and got
quite a lot of attention. Yesterday alone, it drew some 15,000
people, according to Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Public Security Ministry, the seven-month
national crackdown on crime has brought China's rising crime rate
down, with 3.1 percent fewer crimes reported in the first ten
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
An accompanying "winter action" campaign has also started as a
move to put a stop to anyone who might want to take advantage of
the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, during the Chinese new
year, when many people go to visit family members elsewhere and
less public spirited people are driven to use that time to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 12,435 criminal cases were handled in
Beijing last year, 6,426 of which were major cases, resulting in
arrests of 14,088 criminals, and 1,827 gangs being stopped.
