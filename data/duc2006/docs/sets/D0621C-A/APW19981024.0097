Reports: Police chief steps up security amid reported gang threats

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A police chief of a southern Chinese city where
a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security
following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Gang members loyal to ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung have put
a 4 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 512,000 million) price tag
for the death of Guangzhou police chief Zheng Guoqiang, the Hong
Kong Standard said.
	   The assassination threat was said to have been made in a letter
sent to Zheng, the Standard said, without identifying its source.
	   Cheung has been charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and
murder. The trial, which also includes 35 other defendants, in
Guangzhou 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the border, is closed
to journalists.
	   Zheng has been personally leading a fleet of vehicles escorting
the defendants from jail to the central Guangzhou city courthouse
and back.
	   Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese
businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling
explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong
businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of kidnapping a
merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom
(U.S. dlrs 48,300).
	   Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for security, said on Saturday
the government was unable to seek the extradition of Cheung _ a
Hong Kong citizen _ for trial in the absence of any hard evidence,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Speaking after an anti-crime symposium, she said there had been
no hard proof of crimes committed in the territory despite reports
that two of Hong Kong's wealthiest businessmen had been kidnapped.
	   Security has been tight since Cheung's trial began Monday. The
courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of
concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to
assassinate the defendants to silence them.
	   News broadcasts Saturday showed the defendants being led out
from several vehicles _ including armored personnel carriers _
their legs chained, escorted by soldiers in bulletproof vests
carrying machine guns and pistols.
	   The news blackout has fueled various reports in Hong Kong's
flamboyant media, riveted by one of the most dramatic gang trials
in Hong Kong history.
	   On Friday, The South China Morning Post quoted an unidentified
prison source as saying that Cheung and other defendants were
afraid Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them. They were
only eating food brought in for security officials, the newspaper
said.
	   Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily reported that two bomb threats
have been delivered since the trial began.
	   Cheung reportedly has said that he masterminded the kidnapping
of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and
Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   Ming Pao quoted Cheung as saying. ``There would have been no way
that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the
gang's kidnapping spree, had he not been arrested.
