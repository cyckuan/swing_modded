MACAU'S FLAMBOYANT CRIME LORD SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON  
(DW)

   MACAU _ In a last act of justice before it turns this compact
colony over to China, a Portuguese court here convicted a
45-year-old Chinese man on Tuesday of leading a powerful criminal
organization that infiltrated Macau's casinos and terrorized its
government.
</P>
<P>
   The court found the man, Wan Kuok-koi, guilty of loan-sharking,
money laundering and other charges stemming from his reign as the
undisputed lord of the Macau underworld. Declaring that Wan had
shown no remorse, Justice Fernando Estrela sentenced him to the
maximum term of 15 years in prison. Seven of Wan's associates,
including his brother, Wan Kuok-hung, received lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Wan Kuok-koi has mesmerized this Portuguese enclave
on the southern coast of China in the twilight of its colonial
rule. For the Portuguese, it represented a last bit of
housecleaning before it turns Macau over to the Chinese government
on Dec. 19. For Macau's Chinese population, it represented perhaps
the last chapter in the saga of the man known as Broken Tooth Koi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portuguese are doing this to show the world that they
finally did something about organized crime,'' said Joao Severino,
the editor of Macau Hoje, one of the few Portuguese-language
newspapers left in the colony. ``But there will be big trouble
every night after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous convictions of organized crime leaders in Macau have
led to ugly explosions of violence. Tuesday, the authorities were
taking no chances. A police sharpshooter squinted from the roof of
a building across the street from the courthouse. Inside, security
troops from Portugal, clad in bulletproof vests, ringed the austere
courtroom as Estrela read the verdict in a matter-of-fact, almost
subdued, tone.
</P>
<P>
   As the guards surrounded Wan to lead him out of the court, he
began hurling abuse at the judge, prosecutors, and the police in
Chinese and Portuguese. ``You're corrupt, you've taken dirty
money!'' Wan shrieked, jumping on a bench and gesticulating wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Wan subsided, and seeming close to tears, he was
manacled by the guards and led away to begin his sentence in a
high-security prison on a nearby island.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese authorities have been anxious to see Wan
sentenced ever since he was arrested on May 1, 1998, the same day
that his gang allegedly planted a bomb under the car of Macau's
police superintendent. With his flamboyant style and theatrical
boasting about his gangland exploits, Wan had symbolized Portugal's
inability to stamp out organized crime in its last colonial
redoubt.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem threatened to overshadow Macau's return to China,
embarrassing Portuguese administrators and provoking clucks of
disapproval from senior Chinese officials. Local officials contend
that the violence has been exaggerated by the Hong Kong news media
and that the gangs originally came from Hong Kong and Guangdong
Province in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police here are fighting a very particular type of
organized crime,'' said Jorge Rangel, Macau's secretary for public
administration. ``It won't go away, just because of the handover.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people believe the Chinese government will do a
better job of snuffing out criminal activity, in part because it
plans to station army troops in the territory. Chinese courts have
also dealt more harshly with suspected gang leaders than Portuguese
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung Tze-keung, a Hong Kong crime boss known as Big Spender,
was executed last December after being convicted of kidnapping and
arms trafficking. Although Wan's gang, called 14K, is suspected of
drive-by shootings, car bombings and attempted assassinations of
public officials, prosecutors tried him on less serious charges,
which carried the maximum sentence of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Wan contended he was a businessman and a
high-roller who had no idea why he was on trial. With his squat
build, round face and loud tropical-print shirts, Wan looks like
many of the weekend wagerers who jam Macau's down-at-the-heel
casinos. But he inspired deep fear among people here _ not least
the prosecutors and judges whose job it was to go after him.
</P>
<P>
   The first judge in the trial resigned, so the government drafted
Estrela from Portugal. Estrela, a tough disciplinarian, professed
to be unfazed by the defendant's fearsome reputation. Yet the
judge, too, took unusual precautions during the monthlong case. At
lunchtime Tuesday, people in front of the court saw the judge dash
to his waiting car flanked by armed bodyguards.
