	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Law enforcement officers staged about two dozen
raids and arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in
connection with a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
	   The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong
police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old
Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender.''
	   Hong Kong police were alerted when an unidentified man
approached them saying his cousin _ who had sneaked into Hong Kong
from China _ was being held for ransom by the gang, Radio Hong Kong
said.
	   The report quoted Chief Inspector Lam Nam-wing as saying 85
officers were mobilized early Wednesday to search 23 addresses and
two safety deposit boxes.
	   Among those arrested by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Hong
Kong police was Cheung's wife, who was in one of the houses raided,
Television Broadcast reported.
	   Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in
China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery. The gang
allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets
of 17 relatives of Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles
are restrained under the order.
	   Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the
ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about
200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,740) during the raids.
	   The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police _ some of them illegal
immigrants _ are still being detained for questioning.
	   Although no official information was ever released on the
kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons
from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
	   Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland
Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at
seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
	   In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8
million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan
(U.S. dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese
state media.
