China urges Portugal to take steps against crime in Macau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Portugal Sunday to take tougher
measures against gang-related crime in Macau to ensure the
Portuguese colony's smooth handover to Chinese rule next year.
	   A committee picked by China to prepare for Macau's Dec. 20,
1999, handover said it ``took note'' of Portuguese authorities'
measures ``to benefit the protection of social stability'' in the
enclave, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   But the committee also ``hopes Macau's Portuguese government
will take even more effective steps and clamp down harder on the
criminal activities of evil forces,'' Xinhua said.
	   Portuguese officials are ``entirely responsible'' for social
order in Macau until next year's handover, the committee pointed
out in a statement at the end of a three-day meeting in Beijing.
	   A spate of shooting deaths, arson attacks and other acts of
violence believed by police to be linked to gang wars over Macau's
lucrative gambling industry have shaken the tiny enclave as it
moves toward Chinese rule.
	   In May, Macau's Portuguese governor chided Beijing for its lax
reaction to the troubles and called for a tightening of border
controls. Last week, a Chinese police chief denied claims that
Chinese officers had given support to Macau's criminal underworld.
	   The Chinese committee preparing for Macau's handover also
criticized Portuguese administrators for what it said were sluggish
efforts to replace Portuguese civil servants with locally born
Macanese.
	   The delay ``is not beneficial for Macau's stable transition and
smooth handover of government power,'' the committee said, adding
that it was ``deeply concerned.''
