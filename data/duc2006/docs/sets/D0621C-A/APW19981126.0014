Report: Officials asked mainland to spare Hong Kong convicts

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ As a reputed local crime boss fights his death
sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had
previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the
lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in
China.
	   ``We have asked whether it was possible that the death sentence
on convicted Hong Kong people would not be carried out,'' the South
China Morning Post quoted a source as saying.
	   The newspaper identified its source only as a senior Hong Kong
security official. It also reported the source would not disclose
China's response.
	   Hong Kong officials had been working with their mainland
counterparts on an agreement covering the transfer of fugitives,
mutual judicial cooperation in criminal cases and the return of
persons jailed abroad to serve sentences in local prisons, the
paper reported.
	   The lack of such an agreement was highlighted in the case of
Hong Kong gangster Cheung Tze-Keung, who was convicted this month
by a mainland court in a string of crimes and sentenced to death
along with four accomplices.
	   The Post said the Hong Kong-China talks took place before the
trial of Cheung, known by his alias ``Big Spender.'' Cheung's trial
was the first such high-profile cross-border case to be heard since
Hong Kong reverted from British rule to China last year.
	   Human rights groups, legal experts and some politicians have
criticized the Hong Kong government for not seeking a transfer of
the Cheung case to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system
and no death penalty.
	   Many of the alleged crimes were committed in Hong Kong, but the
defendants were tried behind closed doors in the southern Chinese
city of Guangzhou.
	   Meanwhile, Cheung's lawyers are pressing ahead with his appeal,
calling for two tycoons who were allegedly kidnapped to testify at
an appeal hearing, the Post said.
	   The tycoons, reportedly Victor Li, son of property magnate Li
Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip Sun Hung Kai
Properties, never reported any kidnappings to Hong Kong
authorities.
	   This is the main reason why the Hong Kong government did not
have enough evidence to press charges, Hong Kong security officials
have said.
	   Cheung's letter of appeal argues that Cheung cannot be guilty of
kidnapping if there are no victims.
	   ``There is no evidence of a victim reporting a criminal case.
And there is no evidence of someone being criminally harmed. There
are only defendant's statements,'' the Post quoted the appeal as
saying.
	   The Hong Kong government has said it was forwarding to China
clemency pleas for Cheung and one of his gang members on behalf of
their families.
	   The Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to deliver its
ruling on the appeal by mid-February, the Post reported.
