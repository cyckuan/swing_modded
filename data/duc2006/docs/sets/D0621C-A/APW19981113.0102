	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Chinese death penalty handed down to a
reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover
of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday
he will seek international help to spare his client's life.
	   ``I think they made a mistake,'' attorney Ivan Tang told Radio
Hong Kong, a day after a mainland Chinese court delivered verdicts
and sentences for Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 35
members of his gang.
	   Tang said he would appeal on grounds that the mainland had no
jurisdiction over Cheung's case since many of Cheung's alleged
crimes _ including kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons _ were
committed in Hong Kong.
	   Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to
Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and
international rights groups.
	   Some say the case _ the first high-profile cross border trial
since the handover last year _ has set a dangerous precedent and
befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts and legislators.
	   Crimes committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is
imposed, can now be prosecuted in mainland China, where the death
penalty is widely used.
	   But many Hong Kong residents believe the end justified the means
in the Cheung case, which was tried in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160
kms) north of the border.
	   ``It's better to execute him in China rather than wasting the
Hong Kong government's time and money,'' housewife Chan Lee Kit-ho
was quoted as telling the South China Morning Post.
	   ``His family should pay the Chinese government for the bullets
to execute him,'' an import and export worker, Li Huamin, was
quoted as telling the Post.
	   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all
proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of
the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out
there. Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of
the defendants were mainland residents.
	   Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements
on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border
crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can been vastly different
under the two legal systems.
	   Legislator James Toh of the major opposition Democratic Party
said Friday the court's verdict did not reflect the Basic Law _
Hong Kong's post-handover constititution approved by China and
Britain.
	   Toh predicted the verdicts would lower people's confidence in
Hong Kong's independent legal system.
	   Tang said that because neither evidence against Cheung nor
details of the court proceedings were made known in the territory,
Hong Kong residents could face the possibility of arbitrary arrest
and trial while in China.
