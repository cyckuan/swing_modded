	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong crime boss who reportedly
has admitted to participating in the kidnapping of two of the
territory's wealthiest businessmen also claims he had plans to
kidnap more, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao said that Cheung Tze-keung,
whose alias is ``Big Spender,'' told a Chinese court that he was
the only person who had the ability to kidnap a tycoon in Hong
Kong.
	   The newspaper quoted Cheung as saying during his trial in China
that ``had I not been arrested ... there would have been no way
that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the
gang's kidnapping spree.
	   The trial of Cheung and 35 other defendants in Guangzhou,
southern China, is closed to journalists, and Ming Pao did not say
how it obtained its information.
	   Charges against the reputed gangsters center around the killing
of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed
robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping
of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
	   Prosecutors also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant
from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S. dlrs
48,300).
	   Some media reports have said Cheung had already admitted to
planning and participating in the kidnapping of Hong Kong property
tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of
Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   But the Hong Kong Standard reported Friday that Cheung was
trying to pin the blame for masterminding the kidnapping of one
businessman, identified only by the surname ``Li,'' on one of
Cheung's purported henchmen, Chan Chi-ho.
	   Chan was described by the Standard as a professional criminal
who got 290 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 37 million) in the
tycoon's kidnapping.
	   The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly
out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try
to assassinate the defendants to silence them.
	   The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison
source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some
of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were
taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security
officials.
	   Ming Pao said two bomb threats have been delivered since the
trial began, with the second on Thursday allegedly signed by
someone claiming to be a Cheung accomplice.
