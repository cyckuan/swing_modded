FOSHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of a criminal gang in
Foshan City of south China's Guangdong Province, which was
controlled by a larger and more notorious gang in neighboring
Macao, have been apprehended by local police.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 28 people who have been involved in more than
30 cases of blackmail, gambling, illegal use of guns and other
crimes. The gambling cases involved more than 50 million yuan (
about six million U.S. dollars) of illicit money.

<P>
Police also seized a number of guns and ammunition, including
eight military pistols.

The gang was established by Zeng Qiqiang in 1996, as a branch
of the "Shuifang Bang," a large criminal gang in Macao. The gang
in Foshan, with more than 100 members, used to help the "Shuifang
Bang" run its gambling operations and collect money from people by
force.

To date, the provincial public security department of Guangdong
and the local police in Foshan have completely uprooted the gang
which seriously threatened the security of Foshan and Macao.
