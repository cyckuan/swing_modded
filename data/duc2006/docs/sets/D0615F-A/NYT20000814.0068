SCIENCE: IT'S NOT JUST EVOLUTION ANYMORE

   It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state
school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal
about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how
quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year
supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science
curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November
school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this
conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather,
they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their
children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com
times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents
believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a realization that we can't have an informed
generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell,
a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center
for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the
Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ``It's their
right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an
enemy, you see it as a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and
economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution
proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates _ even
the governor _ said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if
the new science standards stayed in place. Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer
said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been
``scared off'' out of concern that their employees' children would
not be getting a good education and that the work force would not
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes
affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she
worried the new science standards could ``put students at a
disadvantage on a national level'' and that ``students from out of
state won't want to come here and study because they feel the
standards won't be up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to
those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning.
Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of
the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and
others brought in speakers like Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown
University microbiologist and author of ``Finding Darwin's God: A
Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In his talks, Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, ``who says it's
wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works
because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Case
said. ``That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they
could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999
Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored
teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another
poll, released this year by the People for the American Way
Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching
evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that
evolution ``is far from being proven scientifically.'' And 68
percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God
created humans and guided their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,''
said Dr. James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso
University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at
the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. ``I really do
sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for
how the two areas that are so important to our life can work
compatibly together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and
research projects like the human genome project now have ethics
panels with religious representatives. And ``in religious
communities there is an awareness of how important scientific
developments have become,'' Moore said. ``If we don't know what's
going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how
can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind
and not know what we need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the battle between evolution and
creationism is over. But the language in which it is fought,
especially on the religious right, has changed. Proponents of
``intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too
complex to have been created by random processes. Only some sort of
an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to
debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil
record.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well
received in some quarters. Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have
included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions
about the certainty of evolution. Kentucky recently eliminated the
word ``evolution'' from its curriculum, substituting the phrase
``change over time.''

   Several other states are debating similar moves. In Arizona and
Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to
present evidence for and against evolution, and Case said he has
been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a
challenge. And dozens of local school boards across the country are
considering teaching some form of creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode
would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show ``that
the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe
that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the church has been good at this,'' said the
Rev. Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the
God and Science Project at Amherst College. ``I think it has been
self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we
have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve. An
awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's
welcoming these questions and these conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and
Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made
scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical
perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a
religion,'' Teresi said. ``You see evolution being taught in a very
teleological way _ this organism is built this way because. This
would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke
holes in other people's theories. I would teach evolution with all
its flaws, and emphasize the randomness. We have to live with the
idea that humans are random creatures.''
