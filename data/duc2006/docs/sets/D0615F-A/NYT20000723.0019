<P>
   Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at
Arizona State University, doesn't believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't (beginitalic)believe(enditalic) in gravity either.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds heretical for a man of science, Johanson says
that evolution is ``not a matter of belief. It's a matter of
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and
why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern
biology. It is one of the most widely accepted notions in science,
ranking alongside gravity, the heliocentric view of the solar
system (planets revolve around the sun) and the roundness of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles
proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his
1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) Darwin said that life on Earth began with simple
organisms and evolved into more sophisticated species over many
thousands of years through a process called natural selection.
Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic
characteristics to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God
through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible,
Genesis. God created all species simultaneously, the world was
completed in six days and humans descended from Adam and Eve - not
earlier primates.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 75th anniversary of the most celebrated
debate between those theories - the Scopes ``monkey'' trial, in
which a young Tennessee science teacher was prosecuted for
violating the state's prohibition against teaching evolution. He
was convicted but fined only $100, and the law was eventually
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy did not end there.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists before Darwin had speculated about the diversity of
life. But it wasn't until such publications as (beginitalic)Origin
of Species (enditalic)defined the concept of natural selection that
the process was made clear. Darwin's book sold out in one day.
Almost immediately, scientists and then the public applauded his
principles as sound though incomplete. Over the past century and a
half, those principles have been even more solidly established,
says Jane Maienschein, professor of biology and philosophy at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more strongly confirmed as basic to science,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is even better understood than gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution explains everything about life,'' says ASU genetics
professor Elliott Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the century, evolution was generally accepted and
had found its way into America's classrooms. Then religious leaders
began a crusade. Accepted for the most part overseas, evolution has
had a roller coaster ride in the United States. Last year the
Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually any mention of
evolution from the state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona schools, teaching evolution is allowed, but some
teachers who fear protests decline. Legislators from time to time
try to ban evolution or include creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Why the battle?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a poor job of explaining it,'' says Goldstein.
``That's it in a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Maienschein agrees. Anti-evolutionists insist the term ``theory
of evolution'' suggests scientists are uncertain of the facts. But
the word ``theory'' does not mean ``guess,'' she says. Scientists
define theory as a series of provable facts, an organizing
framework that has predictions and is testable.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin was not the first scientist to shake the faithful. In the
16th century, Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forth the
startling notion that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of
the reverse. Alarmed citizens of the Earth feared that God would
not be able to find them if their planet were constantly moving.
</P>
<P>
   To remove Earth from the center of the solar system was
disturbing enough, but then Darwin removed humans from the center
of the animal kingdom. The Bible taught that man was given dominion
over the creatures of the Earth. Darwin's ideas instead put man on
a par with every creature from gnats to whales.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin, who followed the tenets of the Church of England as well
as Unitarianism, was a reluctant prophet. Knowing his findings
would be unsettling, he published his research only at the urging
of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was developing
rudimentary theories of genetics, though they would largely be
ignored until scientists rediscovered his work around 1900. The
field of genetics took root in the 1930s, building on Darwin's
studies and reinforcing evidence seen but not yet explained.
</P>
<P>
   While some people find belief in a divine creator easier than
understanding genes and chromosomes, Goldstein sees science and
faith as compatible. He equates God's work with the forces of
nature and sees the Bible not as a scientific textbook but as a
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Bible is God-inspired,'' Goldstein says. ``To
believe in God doesn't mean you have to believe in creationism.''
</P>
<P>
   To endorse creationism, he says, is to deny nearly all
scientific fields, including geology, astronomy, biology, physics
and chemistry. And to deny the elegant workings of evolution is to
miss the beauty of such a grand mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for them,'' he says of creationists. ``They're
missing God's wonders because they're misinterpreting God's
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the pity, says Dale Langmade, president of the Arizona
Origin Science Association. ``He doesn't need to feel sorry for me,
because I can see the same beauty in intelligent design.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental Christians like Langmade take the Bible literally in
its explanation of the creation of the universe, he says, though
some agree the Earth is older than 6,000 years. Some support the
notion of natural selection as one of God's tools.
</P>
<P>
   Langmade, who attended ASU and the University of Alaska, takes
exception to the idea that creationists cannot embrace the panorama
of science if they reject evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a cheap shot,'' he says, noting that such legendary
scientists as Copernicus, Galileo, Isaac Newton and Francis Crick
were men of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Langmade has spent time admiring the strata in the walls of the
Grand Canyon, which he calls evidence of the Biblical account of
the Great Flood. God put humans in charge of the animal kingdom, he
says, because they were created in God's image: ``Man is the image
of God, not flies.''
</P>
<P>
   But what most disturbs anti-evolutionists is that the theory
appears to remove God from life's equation. Larry Kisner, a retired
physicist in the aerospace industry and editor of the Arizona
Origin Science Association newsletter, believes a secular
explanation of the origin of the universe negates moral absolutes.
He points out that evolution has been used to justify eugenics and
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is also a religion,'' Kisner says. ``It's
paganism.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's a reason that America more than Europe champions the
crusade against what has been dubbed ``evil-ution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America has been the moral agent of the world for many
generations,'' Kisner says. ``We were founded that way. {hellip}
That's why the battle is fiercer here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are waging their own battle, fearing America suffers
if evolution is not taught in schools. The public must be informed
on such issues as genetic research, the overuse of antibiotics, the
human genome project - all of which are built upon evolutionary
principles, Maienschein says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a poll commissioned by the liberal civil rights group People
for the American Way found that while 83percent of Americans favor
teaching evolution in public schools, 79percent think creationism
also has a place in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports are ``good news and bad news,'' says science writer
Jonathan Weiner, whose book, (beginitalic)The Beak of the Finch: A
Story of Evolution in Our Time(enditalic), won the 1995 Pulitzer
Prize for non-fiction. Weiner takes heart that a majority of
respondents support the teaching of evolution, and he does believe
students should learn that some religious beliefs dispute those
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``Every educated person should know and understand
the theory of evolution. It's such a beautiful theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner understands why this is a sometimes frightening period in
scientific history. Cloning, gene therapy, genetic engineering -
where does it stop? Will scientists some day construct human beings
not just with a choice of hair and eye color but with specific
behavioral and personality traits as well?
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is sometimes taken as a symbol of science run amok. In
times of uncertainty, Weiner says, people embrace the familiar and
reject notions that appear too revolutionary. Creationists want to
halt the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake here is the future of our children, our
society and our world if our children are taught that there is no
God or that they must compartmentalize their faith from school,''
Kisner says.
</P>
<P>
   Maienschein argues that evolution will be the savior of a
fragile world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can screw up the environment and then save it,'' she says.
``That's a source of hope.'' Tim Koors/The Arizona RepublicIs a 3
