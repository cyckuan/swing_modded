 &HT;    Baylor center wants to wedge religion into science class
 &HT;    By John Young

   WACO, Texas _ They are the new breed of creationists. Atomic
creationists, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   And their official harboring at Baylor University has caused
many in the faculty to go nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   The launching of a center to promote ``theistic science'' or
``intelligent design'' is proving to be one of the biggest
controversies of the Robert Sloan presidency. If not the biggest
controversy, possibly it is the most emblematic.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the Michael Polanyi Center. Created supposedly to
build a bridge between science and religion, it shares a hangar
with Baylor's Institute for Faith and Learning. Problem: Baylor
didn't consult anyone in its science departments. To much of the
faculty, this is no bridge. It's a detour.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the faculty senate, Robert Baird, calls Polanyi
``one of the most divisive issues'' in his 32 years at Baylor and
bemoans that a center focused on what it calls the ``growing
dialogue between science and religion'' was created without a word
sought from Baylor's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the concern is over process, such as the science
faculty's perceived snubbing, the overriding issue is substance _
what Polanyi is about.
</P>
<P>
   What it's about is not an alliance with science but the refuting
of it, or at least refuting the science of evolution and its
Darwinist underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear within the first few words of a conference called
``The Nature of Nature'' hosted by Baylor and the center last week.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas philosophy Professor Robert Koons told the
audience that with the whole of evidence examined, scientists
(evolutionists) ``have no authority to dictate to us.'' Dialogue,
anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature is comprehensible only'' if an outside force _ God _
has set in motion all the inner complexity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koons among others, including Polanyi director William Dembski,
adheres to the ``intelligent design'' theory _ the new creationism.
Essentially it grants to science certain facts: that the world is
billions of years old rather than a few thousand, that evolution is
a fact as it pertains to plants and animals, right up to the
doorstep of man.
</P>
<P>
   However, the essence of intelligent design is that man is in
God's image, as the Bible says.
</P>
<P>
   As Christians, Baylor science faculty members who so vehemently
denounce Polanyi may not disagree with that bottom line. They just
see the ``intelligent design'' crowd as seeking to put a tourniquet
on inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor associate psychology Professor Charles Weaver derides it
as the ``God card'' characterized by the bumper sticker meant to
annoy any scientist: ``God says it; I believe it; that settles
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever God might say, science is the process of studying that
which can be examined and tested empirically.
</P>
<P>
   In a feisty and somewhat quixotic way, the intelligent design
crowd is like a kickboxer challenging a microscope to a fight. The
microscope is not there to fight. It is there to examine.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the scientists won't fight. Baylor
associate biology Professor Richard Duhrkopf, a bitter critic of
Polanyi, said the center's quest is to ``change the philosophy of
science.'' More ominously, it is advocated by creationists as a
wedge to get religion into science class in public schools, as
reported recently by ``CNN Newsstand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin is dead, Darwinism is getting sicker by the day,''
wrote creationist Hal Ostrander in a recent commentary in SBC Life
extolling the work of Dembski and Co. Ostrander gushes about the
potential of intelligent design to transform science class in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Baylor faculty see the Polanyi Center as
undermining the university's reputation in the sciences. If Baylor
thinks Polanyi is worth risking its reputation, maybe that
empirical stuff isn't what it wants to be known for.
