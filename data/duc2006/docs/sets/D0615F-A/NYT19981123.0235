<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Cissy Bennett, a high school biology teacher in
Birmingham, Ala., has to use a textbook with a disclaimer in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution,'' says the message from the Alabama State Board of
Education, ``is a controversial theory some scientists present as
scientific explanation for the origin of living things, such as
plants, animals and humans. No one was present when life first
appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins
should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not deter Ms. Bennett from teaching her students that
humans and all other species developed from common ancestors under
the influence of natural selection. ``I tell them on the first day,
`We are going to learn about evolution,' '' she said. `` `I do not
care if you believe what I am saying, but you will learn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But some teachers are more intimidated by the disclaimer. One
colleague, Ms. Bennett said, once told her that she thought
teaching evolution was against the law.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 73 years since another high school biology teacher,
John Scopes, was found guilty under Tennessee law for teaching that
humans and apes descended from a common ancestor, and 30 years
since the United States Supreme Court essentially overturned the
Scopes ruling and declared that states could not prohibit teachers
from discussing evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the
nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists,
state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science
education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution-creation controversy is as charged today as it
was when Scopes was tried,'' said Randy Moore, a professor of
biology at Louisville University in Kentucky and the editor of The
American Biology Teacher, a magazine published by the National
Association of Biology Teachers. ``Creationists are more powerful
than ever. They're winning, not in terms of courts cases, but what
happens in classrooms. I get three to five phone calls a week from
teachers with problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent caller, Moore said, told him that a high school
principal in Louisville had used the public address system in his
school to announce that evolution had been overthrown and no longer
needed to be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with incidents like these, teachers of evolution have been
in ``a defensive mode,'' said Wayne Carley, executive director of
the 7,500-member biology teachers association.
</P>
<P>
   The association and other groups like the National Academy of
Sciences and the largest professional group of evolutionists, the
Society for the Study of Evolution, are embarking on a concerted
effort to change the way Americans view evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution was at the center of the biology teachers' annual
convention, which brought Moore and Ms. Bennett and about 1,500
other teachers to Reno this month. Teachers heard about the latest
challenges in the classroom, received a copy of a book published
earlier this year by the National Academy of Sciences about
teaching evolution, and crowded into more than a dozen workshops on
teaching the theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the lack of emphasis on evolution in
kindergarten through 12th grade, with the immense popularity of
creationism among the public, and the industry of discrediting
evolution,'' Moore said, ``it's easy to see why half of the
population believes humans were created 10,000 years ago and lived
with dinosaurs. It is by far the biggest failure of science
education from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to teaching evolution have changed, said Dr.
Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for
Science Education, which monitors the teaching of creationism in
schools and communities nationwide. The latest wrinkle, Scott said,
is to try to introduce into the classroom other theories like
``intelligent design'' _ the idea that the universe is so
impossibly complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an
omniscient creator.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism ranges from literal interpretations of Genesis in
the Bible to the belief that God created and set in motion the
process of evolution itself, a view shared by up to 40 percent of
scientists according to national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, who has written four books attacking ``the
dogmatic teaching of Darwinian evolution,'' advocates that students
be taught to be distrustful of the evolution theory.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is affiliated with Access Research Network, a group in
Colorado Springs, Colo., that promotes intelligent design in the
biology textbook ``Of Pandas and People.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, some sessions featured well-established
lessons like comparing early hominid skulls and fossil footprints
to the heads and feet of students in classes. But other workshops
discussed current research in evolutionary biology and how the
latest findings could be used to add new life to lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project, for example, is finding an increasing
number of genes that are shared by different species, from worms to
mice to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of bacteria that cause infections to become
increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and the resistance insects
develop to pesticides offer real life examples of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers were even shown a case where HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, developed a resistance to different drugs within a patient
suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The association honored two high school science teachers who
served on the front lines in the legal fight to teach evolution.
Susan Epperson of Arkansas and Don Aguillard of Louisiana both took
legal cases to the United States Supreme Court. Epperson vs.
Arkansas outlawed state bans on teaching evolution in 1968, and in
Edwards vs. Aguillard, the Court ruled in 1987 that states could
not require that ``creation science'' be taught along with
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two teachers, who volunteered to serve in these test cases,
have become folk heroes to some biology teachers. They have been
stopped in the halls to autograph programs and have their pictures
taken. But despite their legal victories, Ms. Epperson and
Aguillard warned that the battle goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight has shifted from people like Susan and myself to
you,'' Aguillard told the teachers. ``The task has shifted from
constitutional challenges to grass roots efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 387 Louisiana biology teachers, Aguillard
found that 24 percent believed in creationism and 29 percent
believed it was appropriate for high school biology classes. Some
teachers he interviewed said they ignored evolution, and one told
Aguillard, ``I try to poke as many holes in it as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   To Aguillard and others in the biology teachers association
those findings, which echo previous studies in other states,
indicate that creationism is not fading away, but is itself
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   The center for science education is involved in a court case
challenging a school board resolution in Tangipahoa, La., that
instructs teachers to read a disclaimer recommending that students
consider ``other concepts'' than evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The center is also mulling a legal challenge to the Alabama
disclaimer, but that may be tough, said Scott, because the warning
is written with finesse. ``This is bad science, and the First
Amendment doesn't protect us from bad science,'' she said. ``We
would have to convince a judge that it is a disguised sectarian
religious view.''
</P>
<P>
   Cissy Bennett, for one, is not sure that a legal challenge is
the way to go. People are tired of the controversy, she said.
Biology teachers in Alabama won a fight to get decent textbooks
that include evolution. The disclaimer ``seemed like a good
compromise,'' she said, adding: ``We're able to get around it. Most
teachers just teach their stuff and ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   At their annual meeting, biology teachers shared strategies for
dealing with problems in class. Most start their classes by
discussing the differences between science and religion, and talk
about the limits of science and the fact that theories are always
subject to correction and change.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers acknowledge their own faiths and offer to talk
with students outside class. Most have found ways to go on teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change very many minds,'' said Greg Wickett, a 10th
grade biology teacher in Oregon. ``When a kid is 15 years old, of
course his minister and parents are influencing him more than his
teachers. That's how it should be. I've had students who called me
the devil. I told them I wasn't trying to convert them. I'm not
trying to teach them religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irene Eckstrand, who heads a new education committee of the
Society for the Study of Evolution, says she believes it is almost
inevitable that teachers will be defensive. ``They're held
accountable to so many people,'' said Dr. Eckstrand, whose group is
working with the teachers association to integrate new research
into classes. ``Teachers are on the front line. But I'd like to see
us not be so defensive. We have a wonderful story to tell.''
