   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ When it comes to teaching evolution, Al Frisby
won't compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Frisby, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission Northwest High
School, starts each school year by explaining to parents what their
children will learn: the habits, physical characteristics and life
processes of plants and animals, and evolution, to explain how
those processes developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without evolution, the building will fall down,'' Frisby said.
``It's the cornerstone of biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisby is adamant that the Christian belief in a universe
created by God has no place in his science classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Frisby's brightest students, 14-year-old Heather
Ellsworth, sees evolutionary theory as so much hogwash. She
believes God alone created the earth and everything on it, just as
the Bible says.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers take a low-key approach to teaching evolution, the
scientific theory that living things share common ancestors but
change over time. Others, such as Frisby, emphasize it.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of this discussion are Kansas' new science
curriculum standards. The version written by a state committee
would declare evolution one of five concepts that unite all
scientific disciplines. A competing proposal presented by a
conservative state school board member would remove the emphasis on
evolutionary theory and question its validity.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member Kansas Board of Education, split evenly down
conservative-moderate lines, is struggling to find consensus
between the two ideas. The courts and many in the science
community, including Frisby, say those ideas are mutually exclusive
inside science classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   On Heather's first day in freshman biology, Frisby told his
class that evolution holds the underpinnings for the life sciences.
After class, Heather approached him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mr. Frisby, I don't agree with evolution,' '' Heather
remembered. ``He said, `Let's agree to disagree.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And they've been disagreeing agreeably all year long. Frisby
hasn't changed his lessons to accommodate Heather's beliefs,
although last fall he did attend a creation science workshop at the
invitation of Heather's father.
</P>
<P>
   Heather hasn't changed her mind, either, but she answers test
questions on evolution by the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with that,'' said the Rev. Phil Ellsworth,
Heather's father and pastor of the evangelical Grace Christian
Fellowship Church in Shawnee.
</P>
<P>
   Could this truce be the kind of middle ground that Kansas Board
of Education members are looking for?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Scharmann thinks it might be.
</P>
<P>
   As an education professor at Kansas State University, Scharmann
tells future teachers they should not present theories such as
evolution in ways that polarize their students. Teachers needs to
realize that students, like everyone else, value the beliefs
they've learned from their families and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trying to beat that out of them,'' Scharmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding doesn't mandate belief, Scharmann said. Science
teachers taking a realistic view of their students know this, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Students) don't have to believe these theories, just know how
to use them,'' Scharmann said. ``Evolution, like all good
scientific theories, is an excellent problem-solving tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The science standards that have revived the debate determine
what Kansas students will learn and be tested on.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, written by a state committee appointed in part by
the state board, are based on guidelines from national science
associations. Evolution takes a leading role, and that's what led
to the alternate proposal put forth by conservative board member
Steve Abrams of Arkansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' version would change the definition of science,
eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add to the
glossary a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and
complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has said the intent of his proposal is partly to allow
school districts the freedom to decide how to handle teaching
evolution. That's similar to the way the Missouri curriculum
standards work, said Orlo Shroyer, Missouri's assistant
commissioner of education.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over evolution is nothing new for members of the
Shawnee Mission Northwest science department.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the school's science test scores dipped
because teachers were avoiding evolutionary theory, said Robert
Siemens, the department chairman. So the department beefed up its
approach to evolution, Siemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a few students and parents objected to a mural in the
science hall depicting the evolution of humans from an apelike
creature to modern man. The mural remains, but the teachers wonder
for how long.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, the science standards are causing much
discussion, at least among the science faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers know that some students don't believe evolution
occurred. Although most of Siemens' students realize the theory has
a place in science classrooms, there always are a few who ask to be
excused from learning about evolution, saying it goes against their
religious belief in creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them have been taught that they have to believe one
or the other,'' Siemens said. ``And that's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Siemens and Frisby always end their units on evolution by
assigning students a paper on the origin of life. The assignment
gives students the chance to defend their beliefs, and some always
choose to write on creation.
</P>
<P>
   Frisby said that this year he has more students _ about 40
percent _ who don't accept evolution. One parent has offered
nm &LR; bate Frisby on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Ellsworth said she understands that Frisby has to
teac(AIY &QC; 1ution as the theory accepted by the majority of
scientists. Her father, Phil Ellsworth, said he's confident his
daughter won't be swayed from her basic religious belief that God
created the world.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ellsworths believe there's room in the science classroom
for more than one theory on the origin of life. But Frisby
adamantly disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm putting my face up against a brick wall,''
Frisby said. ``If there's no evolution, I can't teach. I can't
compromise.''
