WOMAN PROMOTES TEACHING OF CREATIONISM IN KANSAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Someone created every
thing in the universe, Celtie Johnson believes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone made the pen she writes with. Someone made the keyboard
she types on. All complex systems are designed by someone, so it
follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer,
too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense. She rejects the
evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living
things share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas
science community on its ear. Judging from the agitation in the
state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded:
</P>
<P>
   - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state
education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science
teachers and professors to write new science standards for public
schools. The committee's version described the theory of evolution
as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. It drew
objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group
of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate
version of the standards. The alternate draft, presented to the
state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for
months.
</P>
<P>
   - Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging
members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her
group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   - She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in
Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to
question evolution. The group intends to offer the alternate
science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member
from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson
helped write.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in
Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.,
said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,''
said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science
teachers. ``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really
would be a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees
it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations
for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of
the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is
trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that
God created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan., an evolution supporter, says
Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the
facts of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other
creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a
cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School
District's science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,''
McDonald said. ``If you're going to take things out of context, you
can refute anything you want to refute.''  &LR; brk:Fliers at malls
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with
most people she meets. She begins many conversations with creation
naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School
District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts
forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being
created Earth and everything in it. District officials said they
considered the text but rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on
weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars. The fliers
contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just
a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the
significant amount of scientific evidence against it. Why the
censorship?''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the
universe came to be is readily available and has been for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a
stockbroker. ``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution
being taught. She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable
presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory. Many feel
pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up. She
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they
can critically think,'' Johnson said. ``I don't want them to be
plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true.''
 &LR; brk:Macro vs. micro
</P>
<P>
   Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with
Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that
contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no
mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's
unifying concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The revised standards also omit many references to the age of
Earth. There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the
idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and
radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists''
such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six
24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Creationists say
they have evidence that supports this belief:
</P>
<P>
   - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil,
but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means
the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion
into account.
</P>
<P>
   - The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of
finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which
shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic
events in the Bible, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the
world. Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
</P>
<P>
   - Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which
creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
