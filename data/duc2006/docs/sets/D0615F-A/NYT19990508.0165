<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Think of it as an educational tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side, the establishment that has run the nation's
public school systems for years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, social conservatives who say liberalized public
education is destroying the country's moral fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, millions of children.
</P>
<P>
   It is a national phenomenon, but nowhere are the two sides
pulling harder than in Kansas. The state's 10-member elected Board
of Education is split evenly along ideological lines. Five members
are moderate Republicans or Democrats, and five, all Republicans,
are Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is likely to intensify this week, as the board
takes up new science standards and an old question: How did life
and the universe begin?
</P>
<P>
   Evolution would be taught as a cornerstone of science in revised
standards the board will consider Wednesday. The standards spell
out what children would learn and be tested on, and they do not
mention creationism.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative board member is expected to introduce a competing
proposal that questions the validity of evolutionary theory. It
also describes creation as being the result of ``intelligent
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they lack a majority, the conservatives have had an
effect since they first gained control of half the seats in 1996.
Through a series of 5-5 votes and the compromises that followed,
the conservatives have forced new curriculum standards and testing
methods, and they have stalled implementation of some federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meek, a moderate Republican who lost a bid for the state
board in 1996, says the frequent gridlock has hurt Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stand still, people really do pass us by,'' said Meek, a
member of the Spring Hill, Kan., Board of Education. ``I don't
think there's such a thing as standing still anymore. You either go
forward, or you regress.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the board's 5-5 deadlock last year on accepting
federal money through the Workforce Investment Act, which provides
aid to states that develop career programs. Meek says such programs
help students make choices about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives object to such programs because, they
say, they steer students toward jobs that businesses say are in
demand instead of leaving those decisions to the students and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer state board members deadlocked on a plan that was
intended to give students more advanced, real-world math skills.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives objected because the plan would have allowed the
use of calculators _ considered a crutch _ instead of requiring
math by hand only. The moderates compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, approved in March almost a year after first
reaching the board, now focus on basic mathematics and prohibit
elementary students from using calculators on state tests.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gilmore, a conservative from Olathe, Kan., who was
chairman of the Kansas state board for two years, views the
deadlocks as the democratic process at work. If the conservatives
don't always get their way, he said, that is the democratic
process, as well.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues are not the strident radicals they are sometimes
painted to be by political foes, Gilmore said. ``I don't view any
of them as extremists,'' he said. ``I don't think extremists get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is not the only place where Christian conservatives are
making their voices heard:
</P>
<P>
   - In Texas conservative members of the state school board pushed
through a biology textbook with few references to evolution. In
Alabama a conservative group persuaded state legislators to have a
disclaimer about evolution pasted inside every biology text, a move
that the National Center for Science Education said intimidated
teachers from introducing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Other national groups support creationism and ``creation
science,'' the theory that the Earth is just a few thousand years
old and that the dinosaurs died out in the Great Flood, recorded in
Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Courts repeatedly have struck down efforts to teach such
theories in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   - Like their Kansas counterparts, Christian conservatives in
Ohio and Michigan have opposed the federal Workforce Investment Act
and its School-to-Work program.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Parental rights'' initiatives have cropped up in recent
years in Congress and in more than 20 states, including Kansas,
Indiana, Michigan and Colorado. Conservatives say the bills would
guarantee parents' rights to raise their children. Liberals and
moderates say the bills would make it easier for parents to
challenge school teachings on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the members of the Texas school board are
Christian conservatives. Additional states in which Christian
conservatives have significant representation on local and state
boards include California, Ohio and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the
governor.
Wide-ranging power
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Board of Education dictates much of what is taught in
the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The board has sweeping authority over the state's 304 public
school districts, as well as its vocational schools, community
colleges and schools for the deaf and the blind, but not the state
universities. It can require any program it wishes without seeking
the approval of the governor or the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlocked votes have upset some state lawmakers. Feeling
pressure, board members have split the board's two-year
chairmanship, which controls the board agenda. Linda Holloway, a
conservative from Shawnee, Kan., is chairwoman this year; Harold
Roth, a moderate from Haven, Kan., will be chairman in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The board hoped to send voters a message that it would try to
avoid deadlock. Indeed, in March, the board unanimously approved
the compromise math standards.
</P>
<P>
   But a state audit of the board's performance in the last two
years said the deadlocks had frustrated teachers and school
administrators across Kansas. ``The tie votes are seen by some as a
lack of decision-making,'' said the report, released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have worried that conservative members would try
to reverse reform efforts such as Quality Performance
Accreditation, the state's moderate-supported school improvement
program. Under the program, schools are accredited based on how
well students learn specific subjects rather than on standards such
as the numbers of books the schools have.
</P>
<P>
   The accreditation effort developed alongside the state's new
school-finance formula, and both took effect in the early 1990s.
The Legislature saw the new accreditation system as a way to link
accountability and school funding.
</P>
<P>
   Quality Performance Accreditation has remained intact, but
conservatives have slowed the programs that the previous board was
enacting. The accreditation testing program, for example, almost
died after conservatives voted not to renew it in 1997. A
compromise was reached later when moderates, in part, agreed to
scrap subjective tests, which the conservatives disliked.
Finding a voice
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives think public schools have turned away
from the country's educational foundation: Schools run by churches
that taught right and wrong from one basic text, the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Christian conservatives are just trying to have a voice,
said Sam Blumenfeld, a conservative scholar in Boston who writes
for the online news service WorldNet Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld said public schools ``undermine Christians' ability
to influence their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives want to return to a time when public
schools worked, he said. America's founders, he said, were
Calvinists who believed that man is, by nature, a depraved creature
who needs fear of a higher power to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools at one time were based on this philosophy,
Blumenfeld said, but in recent decades the schools have been shaped
by secular humanism, which holds that humans control their
destinies.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives, he said, ``have no influence over what
the public schools do. Whatever policies they have are made by
liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives say ``A Nation at Risk'' gave voice to
their fears. The report, released in the early 1980s by a
presidential panel, sharply criticized American education. That
criticism was taken by Christian conservatives as an explanation of
why society's bedrock _ the family _ was crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense it validated social conservatives' opinions about
higher rates of divorce, teen-age pregnancy and sexually
transmitted disease. America's children spend much of their time in
school. What were they learning there?
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several Christian conservative leaders,
including ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, have publicly
stated their disdain for the nation's public education system.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at last fall's Christian Coalition national
convention, Robertson said that 19th-century reformer John Dewey
trained teachers to spread the ``poison'' of secular humanism into
public schools. Falwell has said public schools are a place of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have decried tests that they say often contain
open-ended questions to which students choose the best answer, not
the right answer. That's a form of moral relativism, in which there
are no rights or wrongs, Christian conservatives say.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive sex education in schools often presents abstinence
as a choice, along with the use of contraception. The context of
marriage is not necessarily part of the lesson. That undermines the
Christian belief that sex outside marriage is wrong, conservatives
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in outcomes-based education, which grew out of the reforms
of the 1980s, conservatives saw a trend toward focusing on
children's social well-being and teaching political correctness at
the cost of rigorous academics.
</P>
<P>
   Education is a top priority of many national conservative
organizations, such as Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and James
Dobson's Focus on the Family. These groups often have state
chapters that can mobilize members for intense grass-roots
campaigning, said Martha McCarthy, an Indiana University education
professor who has studied the religious right.
Political action
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' power stems from that political support, said
Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State. The group publishes
a monthly newsletter that details the activities of the Christian
right.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years conservative leaders have mobilized their
followers to vote for school board members and legislators who
share their beliefs, and low voter turnout in many elections has
ensured their success, Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their claims that public schools are destroying
America, many conservatives advocate publicly financed charter
schools, homeschooling and aid, such as vouchers or tax credits,
for parents who send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want to abolish the public schools, then they
want to Christianize them,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarities between conservatives' efforts across the country
have caused groups such as the liberal People for the American Way
and the Mainstream Coalition in Johnson County, Kan., to suggest
that there is a concerted effort to discredit public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline McKnight, executive director of the Mainstream
Coalition, a nonpartisan group that has been critical of the
conservative movement, points to conservative literature
criticizing school reform efforts by a handful of states. Many of
the publications use the same catch phrases, such as ``fuzzy
standards'' and ``secular humanism.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Christian conservatives won five of the 10 seats on the
Kansas state board, some moderate and liberal groups warned that
the conservative agendas showing up in other states would show up
in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative board members ``have been elected to a position
that's supposed to look out for the best interest of public
schools,'' McKnight said. ``But the argument can be made that they
don't like public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, the former board chairman, said he did not run for
office out of any dislike for schools, but because for many years
social conservatives had no voice in public education. Holding
office, he said, is the American way to ``have a voice in
government to push conservative views.''
New standards
</P>
<P>
   The flap over evolution is heightening public interest in the
new Kansas science standards, which the board will take up
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, which were written by a committee appointed by
education Commissioner Andy Tompkins, list evolution as one of five
unifying concepts that cut across the scientific disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when the standards first appeared before the
board, Christian conservatives have urged board members to reject
the document because evolution goes against their beliefs. They
want equal time for the belief that God alone created Earth and its
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on
the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of
science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution _ the theory that life on Earth has mutated and
adapted over millions of years _ is the accepted theory in the
biological sciences, said Mary Blythe, an elementary science
specialist in the Kansas City, Kan., School District and a member
of the science standards committee.
</P>
<P>
   Students need to be aware of all of the scientific theories to
understand science, Blythe said. That some conservatives continue
to push for creationist ideas to be taught in science classes is a
concern, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from
Arkansas City, who rejects evolution. On Wednesday he will give the
other board members a different draft of the science standards
written by a group of people who don't believe in evolution. The
document includes evolution and ``intelligent design'' _ the theory
that life happened intentionally, not by chance _ under the heading
``historical science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like the standards that were proposed,'' Abrams
said. ``And instead of sitting there complaining, I thought I would
propose something I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Blythe and the other members of the science committee knew that
weaving evolution through the standards would be controversial, but
she said she was puzzled all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a conflict with evolution,'' she said. ``I felt
like it was a mechanism that God started to make everything work.''
