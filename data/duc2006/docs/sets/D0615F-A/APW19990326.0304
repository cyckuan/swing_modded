	BOSTON (AP) -- Fearing a growing assault on the teaching of  
Darwin's theories, a group of textbook authors has launched a 
campaign in defense of evolution education. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement, to be released today at the National Science  
Teachers Association, a convention of 20,000 science teachers, 
comes as some public school districts consider softening their 
evolution curricula. 
</P>
<P>
	``As scientists and teachers, we find it unacceptable that  
school districts considering our books for adoption would be 
encouraged to choose one book over another based on the perception 
that teachers should avoid the topic of evolution,'' the statement 
by 23 authors reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by the California-based National Center for Science  
Education, the signers include Bruce Alberts, president of the 
National Academy of Sciences and an author of a cell biology book. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution education continues to raise passions in American  
schools more than 70 years after teacher John Scopes was convicted 
of violating a Tennessee law against teaching it. And the debate 
rages a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that public schools 
can't teach that God created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last five years, the National Center for Science  
Education has logged scores of complaints from parents and 
educators worried about attacks on evolution education. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school districts have pushed for textbooks that are  
considered ``soft'' on evolution teaching, said Molleen Matsumura 
of the NCSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have advocated disclaimer stickers on texts, such as one  
approved by the Alabama Board of Education in 1995. The Alabama 
label explains that evolution is a theory and that text statements 
about the origins of life should be considered as such. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Melvindale-Northern Allen Park School Board in  
Michigan decided to supply some of its libraries with books that 
raise questions about the validity of evolutionary theory. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Texas last year, school districts across the state were  
urged to adopt textbooks that didn't ``harp on'' evolution, 
Matsumura said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Christian publisher's textbook, ``Of Pandas and People,'' has  
grown in popularity. It, and others like it, subscribe to the 
theory that the world and its living creatures came about by 
``intelligent design.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evolution scientists say that's just code for creationism.  
</P>
<P>
	The evolutionists are ``vastly overreacting to what we're trying  
to accomplish,'' said Raymond G. Bohlin, who has a doctorate in 
molecular biology and heads the Probe Ministries, based in 
Richardson, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	What he and others want, he said, is for evolution to be fairly  
represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are no other theories, the scientists who signed the  
statement say. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching biology without evolution is like teaching physics  
while ignoring gravity, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's academically and intellectually dishonest to teach  
biology any other way,'' said Eric Strauss, author of a popular 
introductory biology textbook and a biology professor at Boston 
College.
