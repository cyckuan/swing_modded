   FLORENCE, Ky. _ Since dedicating himself to creationism 20 years
ago when he was a disillusioned science teacher in Australia, Ken
Ham has found that progress generally can be slow, but hardly as
slow as his evolutionist adversaries would have the world believe.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to America five years ago, Ham, a dedicated
Christian fundamentalist with an Abe Lincoln gaze to his musings
about the origin of life, now directs a $5-million-a-year
enterprise and claims to have 110 ``creation clubs'' in schools
across the country. He expects more as he spreads the literal word
according to Genesis _ that creation was a divine accomplishment in
six days _ and tries to debunk the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem an uphill struggle, but Ham takes comfort that
the phones and Web site of his nonprofit organization, Answers in
Genesis Inc., are still busy with the stir created by creationism's
biggest victory to date _ the Kansas Board of Education's decision
last August to yield to growing pressure and delete virtually any
mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed last month by the decision of state education
officials here in Kentucky to eliminate the word ``evolution'' but
not the scientific theory of evolution from the school curriculum
and to substitute the phrase ``change over time.'' In Oklahoma,
officials recently ordered that textbooks must bear a disclaimer
about the certainty of evolution. On the other hand, New Mexico's
Board of Education voted last month to bar creationism and
overwhelmingly endorse evolution in the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole battle is hotting up,'' Ham summarized amid some
glaring, gaping full-sized dinosaur models scattered about his
headquarters like an oddly dissenting chorus on the phylogenetic
scale. Ham uses the mystery about the sudden disappearance of
dinosaurs from creation as an argument against evolution. He is
planning to build a creationist museum north of here near
Cincinnati, full of naturalist displays presenting ``creation
science'' arguments that creation was accomplished 6,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under the theory of evolution, rooted in a myriad of fossil,
anatomic and genetic evidence, the scientific consensus is that
life began on earth around 3.9 billion years ago, with humans and
other species evolving from a common ancestor. Ham has his own
staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted
monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other
underpinnings of modern science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a culture war hotting up in America between Christian
morality and relative morality, which is really the difference
between a creation-based philosophy and an evolution-based one,''
said Ham, who argues that if the word ``day'' in Genesis' account
of creation is allowed to be taken metaphorically to encompass eons
and to blur divinity's role, then the Bible is made fallible and
morality reduced to human whim.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not America is ready for such a culture war of words,
Ham is. His group claims 140,000 on its mailing list and more than
3,000 visitors a day to its Web site at www.answersingenesis.org. H
says the organization is growing as political leaders are more
tempted to tinker with accepted notions about evolution. Supported
by donations and fees on a wide array of handsomely produced
recordings and publications, Answers in Genesis holds seminars
across the country, offering counterarguments to evolution. It
offers not outright Christian fundamentalism, but ``a supplement to
the church,'' in Ham's view.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who sponsor the creation clubs must sign a commitment
to ``the inerrant word of God.'' As a nonprofit group, his
organization does not lobby government. But it presents information
to anyone who asks, and Ham happily claims that some Kansas
officials involved in the curriculum decision are quite familiar
with his publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' said Ham, the director of one of the
nation's two dominant creationist groups. The other is the
Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, where Ham once
worked. He decided to strike out on his own into what he says is a
growing field of intellectual challenge, but what his critics say
is a fundamentalist protest niche far more lucrative than
enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a rash of statewide problems,'' said Eugenie
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science
Education, the main grass-roots science group active against
creationism, with 4,000 members. While creation clubs are entitled
to free speech, Ms. Scott said, they prepare adherents with
flurries of classroom challenges that ``tend to discourage the
teaching of evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to creationist assaults, the National Science
Teachers Association, with 53,000 teachers, has begun holding
information sessions at its state conventions this fall to prepare
teachers to lead their communities in defending evolution as vital
to a proper education.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Rosenbaum, a Kentucky science teacher, rankles at ``change
over time'' as the state's official new euphemism for evolution. He
expects his state Science Teachers Association, of which he is
executive director, will soon come out firmly behind evolution.
``Put a nail outside and it will rust,'' Rosenbaum commented,
teacherlike. ``That's change over time. But is it evolution?''
</P>
<P>
   Ham is only further encouraged by the evolutionists' rallying to
their cause as his own speaking engagements grow. ``I was trained
in a Christian home by a father always prepared to defend his faith
in a logical way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him do that over and over against liberal theology,''
said Ham, confidently patting the synthetic hide of a large
dinosaur being prepared for the future museum of creationism. The
information card of the extinct creature offered the standard
natural history pedigree, with an added notation: ``Created Day
Six.''
