   Drawing on the deep resources of ``creation science'' advocacy
groups, American fundamentalists are arming themselves with the
latest books challenging details of Darwinian theory, getting
elected to majority positions on school boards and learning ways to
word curriculums so that creationism and evolution get equal
respect. While they have gotten very good at making a case for
teaching alternative theories, a small group of scientists and
educators stands in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America's children are not being taught that the world
might have come into existence only 10,000 years ago, versus the
nearly 4.5 billion years advocated by scientists, and this is
largely because of the SWAT-like efforts of the National Center for
Science Education.
</P>
<P>
   The center, based in Berkeley, Calif., has four full-time
employees and 4,000 members. Within 24 hours of a call for help,
Eugenie C. Scott, the executive director, jumps into action.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on a ``frayed, shoestring budget,'' the center can
help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools. The
center supplies concise articles and pamphlets refuting the claims
of creation science, legal advice and summaries of court cases
involving creationism, tips on writing letters to the editors of
local newspapers, advice on how to explain issues to reporters,
phone numbers of national experts on evolution, links to dozens of
organizations that can offer help, and the phone numbers of other
people in their state who are willing to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the only group providing this kind of information for
people who need it,'' said Dr. Ronald Numbers, a professor of
medical history and ethics at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison and an expert on the creationist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the center was founded in 1981, to provide a grass-roots
response to creationist challenges, it has been active in all 50
states, Scott said. Most fights over creationism vs. evolution
happen at the local level, in small towns in rural states where
populations are fairly homogeneous. ``You don't see it in large
cities where people come from diverse backgrounds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., likened the center to ``a national fire
department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the scientific integrity of biology teaching is under
fire or compromised,'' he said, ``the center goes there to provide
support and lend resources to people who are actually fighting the
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a creationist challenge can be ``nipped in the bud''
with just a few well-chosen maneuvers, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year the school board in Post Falls, Idaho, at
the behest of creationists in the community, wrote a policy
statement that would have allowed creation scientists considerable
latitude in making their views known in public schools. The Center
for Science Education, contacted by a member of the community,
reviewed the statement and discovered that the school district was
opening itself to a violation of the laws of church and state. The
suggestions made by the center kept the school district from
running afoul of those laws, and the school curriculum did not
change.
</P>
<P>
   In other situations, creationists prevail. A year ago a
committee of educators in Kansas began a routine update of the
state's science standards and called on the center for help on what
they knew would be a delicate task. The statewide committee of 27
science teachers, which submitted the new standards to the Kansas
Board of Education, was stunned two weeks ago when the Board
decided to drop evolution from the required state curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to keep evolution in the classroom is a David vs.
Goliath struggle. The Center for Science Education has an annual
budget of $250,000, collected from members, compared with the $3
million of the Institute of Creation Research in Santee, Calif.,
one of several fundamentalist groups trying to discredit the
teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott has a powerful slingshot in the form of clergy members
who believe in evolution and scientists who believe in God. When a
local resident steps up before the microphone at a public hearing,
says he a faithful Christian and also believes in evolution, people
are mightily impressed. According to several polls, including one
reported recently in Scientific American, about 40 percent of
scientists believe in God. In local school board battles, members
of the center will find such scientists in the community to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, for example, is both a scientist and Roman Catholic who
has testified before numerous school boards on behalf of evolution.
``The fact that I'm a practicing Christian takes away their
unspoken fear that everyone in science is either an atheist or
agnostic,'' he said. ``I tell them why I believe evolution doesn't
threaten the faith of young people.''

<P>
   Certainly, the Center for Science nettles advocates of
creationism. Duane Gish, senior vice president of the Institute for
Creation Research, accused the center of intimidation and of
``always threatening to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are censors and bookburners,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``They were organized for the sole purpose of fighting
creationists and to keep any evidence for creation science out of
public schools.'' But, he acknowledged, ``They're effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The face-offs have changed over the years as creationists have
adjusted their tactics. Early in this century, Scott said,
creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution and lost. In
1987 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws giving equal time to
the teaching of creationism alongside evolution. ``Instead of
fighting for equal time, they've decided to teach the evidence
against evolution to balance it out,'' Scott said. ``If nothing
else evolves, creationism does.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, creationists have turned their attention to gaps in
the fossil records and an older argument that life is so intricate
and complex it could not have evolved by chance. Their rubrics are
intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory and irreducible
complexity theory.
</P>
<P>
   These new challenges against evolution are being made by
conservative Christians at secular universities who are upset over
the secularization of American society, Scott said. They are not
trying to ban evolution so much as to undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that teachers could teach secular and
scientific alternatives to evolution, Scott said. So the new
battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory _
intelligent design versus Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   John Richard Schrock, director of biology education at Emporia
State University in Kansas and a member of the committee that
worked on the state's science standards, said the center had helped
them be aware of how their choice of wording could open doors for
intelligent-design theorists and other creationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to remove ambiguity,'' he said. ``They helped us with
our definition of evolution as theory,'' Schrock said. They also
helped change wording in a tolerance statement _ promoting respect
for alternative views _ that would not open the door to teaching
religious creationism in history classes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the School Board ignored the committee's work and
voted in its own viewpoints, Schrock said. But Scott and her staff
are continuing to fight back. The American Civil Liberties Union
may decide to bring a lawsuit against the Kansas School Board,
Scott said, even as other pressures are put to bear on the state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one leading software company that is looking to
expand took Topeka off its list. ``That gets peoples' attention,''
she said.
