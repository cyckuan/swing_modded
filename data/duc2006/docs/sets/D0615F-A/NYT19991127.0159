   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Someone created every thing in the universe,
Celtie Johnson believes.
</P>
<P>
   Someone made the pen she writes with. Someone made the keyboard
she types on. All complex systems are designed by someone, so it
follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer,
too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense. She rejects the
evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living
things share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas
science community on its ear. Judging from the agitation in the
state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded:
</P>
<P>
   - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state
education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science
teachers and professors to write new science standards for public
schools. The committee's version described the theory of evolution
as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines. It drew
objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group
of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate
version of the standards. The alternate draft, presented to the
state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for
months.
</P>
<P>
   - Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging
members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her
group's standards.
</P>
<P>
   - She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in
Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to
question evolution. The group intends to offer the alternate
science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member
from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson
helped write.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in
Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.,
said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,''
said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science
teachers. ``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really
would be a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees
it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations
for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of
the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is
trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that
God created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan., an evolution supporter, says
Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the
facts of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other
creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a
cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School
District's science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,''
McDonald said. ``If you're going to take things out of context, you
can refute anything you want to refute.''
Fliers at malls
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with
most people she meets. She begins many conversations with creation
naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be
true?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School
District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts
forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being
created Earth and everything in it. District officials said they
considered the text but rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on
weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars. The fliers
contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just
a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the
significant amount of scientific evidence against it. Why the
censorship?''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the
universe came to be is readily available and has been for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a
stockbroker. ``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution
being taught. She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable
presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory. Many feel
pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up. She
has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they
can critically think,'' Johnson said. ``I don't want them to be
plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true.''
 &LR; brk:Macro vs. micro
</P>
<P>
   Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with
Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that
contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no
mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's
unifying concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The revised standards also omit many references to the age of
Earth. There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the
idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and
radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists''
such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six
24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years. Creationists say
they have evidence that supports this belief:
</P>
<P>
   - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil,
but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means
the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion
into account.
</P>
<P>
   - The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of
finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which
shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic
events in the Bible, creationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the
world. Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
</P>
<P>
   - Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which
creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists counter that the decay is not steady and that much
evidence exists for several reversals of the decay rate.
</P>
<P>
   Most creationists say that scientific theories must be
observable. Although it is true that monkey blood and human blood
are similar, that is not evidence the two species are related, said
Glen Kailer of Perry, Kan., a researcher with the Creation Science
Association for Mid-America. Creationists view that similarity as
more proof of design, Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Chevy and a Ford are not descended from a common ancestor,''
Kailer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been
observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness: the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionists, on the other hand, believe that some science
works in the comparative mode, said Ed Wiley, a University of
Kansas evolutionary biologist. Something that is true for one life
form will be true for another.
</P>
<P>
   One particular point of contention is transitional life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists say that scientists have not found any fossils of
transitional animals and that no transitional animals exist today.
They do not believe that animals such as the archaeopteryx, a bird
with reptile characteristics that some scientists think links birds
and dinosaurs, are transitional.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the archaeopteryx is not a true intermediate form
between birds and reptiles, Wiley said. But it had transitional
characteristics between the two species, such as wings and
reptilian attributes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said creationists would not ever accept the archaeopteryx
as a transitional animal, because it was too dangerous to their
faith in a God so powerful he could create everything just as it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, believing that Earth is older than described
in the first chapter of Genesis threatens some creationists'
understanding of the basis of their faith, said Keith Miller, an
evangelical Christian and a geologist at Kansas State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians, Miller said, find no conflict with believing
that God could have used evolution to create the universe. Biblical
literalists cannot accept that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of
years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans. That
would mean death and dying came long before Adam and Eve were cast
out of the Garden of Eden in what Christians know as the Fall of
Man, Miller said. That is in direct conflict with a literal reading
of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view their interpretation of Scripture as being
primary,'' Miller said. ``They don't accept the validity of
nonbiblical sources of truth. Everything comes through a scriptural
lens.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miller and Wiley, evolution is a fact of nature with many
theories of how it works.
</P>
<P>
   But for people such as Johnson and Ham, evolution is a
philosophical belief system just like creation. Ham said both
groups agreed on observable facts such as natural selection and
mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Those things are ``what we observe in the present,'' Ham said.
``In trying to connect to the past, you have to use faith.''
 &LR; brk:`Days in shock'
</P>
<P>
   Celtie and Eric Johnson think many scientists overlook
evolution's missing details, such as transitional fossils, and
teach the scientific theory as proven fact to unsuspecting science
students.
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson said she spent decades believing that humans
evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other
species over millions of years. A former premedicine major, she
faults a belief in evolution for leading her to make bad decisions
as she struggled through more than one divorce and a life she saw
as purposeless and random.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dog eat dog,'' Johnson said. ``That's what I was living.
It was survival of the fittest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day about five years ago she was talking to her
brother, a mechanical engineer, and he brought up intelligent
design. Johnson said she did not have a clue as to what he was
talking about. She knew only about evolution. But her brother told
her there was overwhelming evidence against evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Something clicked. Johnson began to research creation. Soon Eric
Johnson joined in. They began to feel more and more duped by their
science classes, Celtie Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent days in shock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the shock wore off, Johnson said, she decided she had to
spread the word. She joined the Creation Science Association,
seeking more information.
</P>
<P>
   It was Johnson's insistence that the Kansas science standards
were flawed that drew together the band of writers who drafted the
alternate standards, said Kailer, one of the writers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's motivation was good science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celtie is not at all alone,'' he said. ``Celtie is one of the
thousands who recognize the absurdity of evolution as science.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is one of the few willing to speak out, said Linda
Highland of Olathe, who first met Johnson at a legislative forum
some years back. Highland said the state board made the right
decision in August, and she credited Johnson for helping board
members find the strength to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that maybe she builds courage in others by showing
that she isn't afraid to take this issue on,'' Highland said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she was motivated by the search for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. Maybe some people have the ability to
see the proof,'' she said. ``I think the majority of people believe
in evolution because they don't have the facts.''
