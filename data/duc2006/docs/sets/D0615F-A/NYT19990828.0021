   KANSAS _ In the days after the Kansas Board of Education voted
to play down evolution in the state's science standards, chairwoman
Linda Holloway joked that evolution supporters were acting as if
the sky was falling.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks have passed since the Aug. 11 decision, and
the sky is still where it's supposed to be, but there has been
fallout on many fronts:
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western
Missouri sent a letter to the superintendents of each of the
state's 304 school districts. It reviewed recent U.S. Supreme Court
decisions that outlawed teaching biblical creationism in science
classes.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Adkins of Leawood said he would sponsor
legislation requiring high school students entering state
universities to have studied evolution, the theory that living
things have common ancestors and change over time.
</P>
<P>
   Two national science organizations _ the National Academy of
Sciences and the American Chemical Society _ condemned the board's
action as a setback for science education in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution proponents formed a group, Kansas Citizens for
Science, to support teachers and districts that want to teach the
theory.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of a new textbook on Kansas history has decided to
drop a chapter on the state's prehistory. The chapter focused on
the prehistoric inland sea and 150 million-year-old fossils found
in western Kansas. After hearing national reports about the new
science standards, the board of the foundation publishing the book
thought some Kansans might take issue with those topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we talk about (things that old), then it's beyond a
creation date that most religions use,'' said Jim Bean, director of
the Grace Dangberg Foundation in Carson City, Nev., which promotes
the study of history by young people.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State University Professor Gary Conrad said he's having
difficulty recruiting candidates for two openings within the
biology department.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Conrad said, the president of an out-of-state
research institution told him she would discourage her students
from considering Kansas for employment because their children would
be subjected to a public school education that might not include
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   School board members in Pratt, Kan., west of Wichita, listened
to a presentation on a science textbook that espouses the theory of
intelligent design _ the idea that a superior being designed the
universe and everything in it.
</P>
<P>
   During the media frenzy after the vote of the 10-member board,
confusion abounded about the science standards' purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are guidelines for school districts to use as they
determine what students should learn. The document written by a
27-member committee of science educators listed evolution as a
major concept, but earlier this month six board members _ five
conservatives and one moderate _ voted to remove the emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The tests used as part of the state's accreditation program are
based on the standards, and observers say most districts teach to
the test. New science tests to be given in the 2000-2001 school
year will not include questions on macro-evolution, the idea that
different species can share common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita, one of the
board members who favored de-emphasizing evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The board's intent was not to force creationism or any other
theory on the origins of life into science classrooms, but to allow
school districts to decide for themselves, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she checked with officials of the Wichita School
District before the vote and was told students would continue to
learn about evolution. That's the district's prerogative, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't seem to want to trust their local people to make
this decision, and that's all we've done,'' Brown said. ``If Yoder
(Kan.) wants creationism and their people want it, that's their
business. And I'm not going to stand in the way of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown dismisses the idea that the board's decision could harm
Kansas students. But it's a real worry for Bill Wagnon, a board
member from Topeka who supported the standards written by the
science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Wagnon said he feared Kansas would lose its position as a leader
and innovator in education. The K-State professor's troubles
attracting faculty members are just a start, Wagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reputations are hard to earn and easy to shatter,'' Wagnon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The science standards have yet to reach school districts. The
board's attorney still is ironing out copyright questions over
parts of the standards based on materials from the National Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The standards written by the teachers committee relied heavily
on the academy's National Science Education Standards, but the
changed version might not meet with the academy's approval. The
standards will be sent to school districts as soon as those
questions are answered, said Kathy Toelkes, the board's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas and
Western Missouri, said his organization had recruited a Kansas City
law firm to determine what legal recourse the ACLU has. He disputed
Brown's claim of a return to local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have standards at all?'' Kurtenbach said. ``Why select one
aspect of it but pass on pages and pages and pages of other
mandated issues? If it was about local control, the state board
would eliminate all standards and go out of business.''
