DARWIN'S GHOST 
The Origin of Species Updated 
By Steve Jones. Random House. 377 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was both tragedy and triumph that when ``On the Origin of
Species'' was published in 1859, Charles Darwin's name became a
synonym for evolution. Though Darwin studiously avoided mentioning
humans in his book, religious leaders immediately saw ``Darwinism''
as a dangerous anti-religion, a godless belief system that removed
the Creator from creation and made his greatest idea, man, the
grandchild of mere apes.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Darwin's ideas have prevailed. Most mainstream
religions have come to an accommodation with them, though a vocal
minority still rejects evolution and propounds biblically-derived
creationist theories.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of Darwin was the brilliant way the former ministry
student distilled and explained the mechanism of life. His thesis
of descent with modification via natural selection immediately
clicked with people who took the time to consider it. So obvious
was it to zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley that he exclaimed, ``How
extremely stupid not to have thought of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darwin did not just cause readers to smack their heads and
utter, ``Duh.'' He fundamentally changed the way all of us _
including every rejectionist, whether he admits it or not _ see the
world. In ``Darwin's Ghost,'' a fascinating and witty book that
tours the same intellectual territory as Darwin, Steve Jones, a
British geneticist, shows how extensively Darwin's theory explains
the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, his is an argument with both the remaining skeptics of
evolution and those who persist in misapplying Darwin's theory in
realms such as sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Natural selection, Jones neatly observes, is a dumb but
relentless machine that works with the materials at hand. Most of
its products do not last. ``Who could ever have designed a tree
kangaroo?'' But ``clumsy as the animal may seem, it is infinitely
better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and plainly
bears the stamp of far higher workmanship, than anything achieved
by man.'' Which is why engineers of recent years have been studying
natural forms to tease out design ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The more sophisticated school of creationism, of course, may see
in the word ``workmanship'' a hint of ``intelligent design'' and
thus of a deus in the machina of natural selection. Empty logic,
says Jones. Natural selection is the ``plodding accumulation of
error.'' Given enough time to work through enough mistakes,
anything _ velociraptor, tree kangaroo, homo sapien _ will turn up.
So why get caught up in a material-world argument, asks Jones.
``The birth of Adam, whether real or metaphorical, marked the
insertion into an animal body of a post-biological soul that leaves
no fossils and needs no genes.'' The flesh, he wisely notes, is not
a good place to go hunting for the things of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Jones's book is devoted to human, as opposed to
natural, selection _ the breeding programs and hybridization
campaigns that humans have conducted with cattle, dogs, wheat, and
a thousand more species for the past 13,000 years. Domesticated
life forms, he says, are ``silent witnesses to the malleability of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   That very malleability, combined with human technological
prowess, is why we have arrived at a portentious moment. Though he
doesn't spend much time on the subject, it is clear that Jones
believes human cloning and increasingly bizarre forms of
hybridization are, if not now underway somewhere, certainly
imminent and probably dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Jones does not wave the chicken-little banner of ``Frankenfood''
in this book, but here is a geneticist clearly alarmed at the
dangers of genetic manipulation. Already, he points out, beneficial
genes inserted into oilseed rape to promote herbicide resistance
have seeped into wild mustards and radishes. ``Industry's optimism
about the nature and stability of species is unfounded,'' he says.
``Those who cast down the barriers to hybridism will soon be
reminded of what evolution can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin's Ghost'' is written with great authority and a fluid
style, and it is refreshing not to have footnotes littering the
text. But Jones fails to include substantial back-of-the-book
chapter notes to anchor disembodied quotes and expand upon
interesting facts. It is true that light or nonexistent footnotes
are more the British than the American style, but combined with
breezy writing the effect on a reader is an unnecessary wobbliness
about facts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the conceit of this book _ the ``Darwin's ghost''
theme. It is a little misleading. Happily, Jones does not walk in
Darwin's footsteps or retrace the voyage of the Beagle. That would
get old fast. He properly honors Darwin throughout the book, but
his republication of Darwin's chapter summaries and recapitulation
seem contrived. ``Origin'' is readily available (even on the Net).
Unannotated chunks of it do little good in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Where Jones is especially good is in a quick putdown of some of
the wilder claims of sociobiology. ``Evolution is a political sofa
that molds itself into the buttocks of the last to sit upon it,''
he notes. Marxists and ultra-capitalists have both seized on it at
times. So, too, have agenda-driven scientists and journalists. In a
whack at the all-in-our-genes school, he says, ``Sexual fidelity or
promiscuity seems, according to taste, the natural thing to do;
families are often a joy, and patriotism arouses some, but we do
not need natural selection to tell us why.''
</P>
<P>
   If Darwin had a ghost _ a free-floating post-biological soul _
it would enjoy that defense of his theory against the latest crop
of misusers.
