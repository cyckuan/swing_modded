<HEADLINE> Court Refuses Evolution Disclaimer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused to let a public
school district require that the teaching of evolution be
accompanied by a disclaimer mentioning ''the biblical version of
creation'' and other teachings on life's origin.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote Monday, let stand rulings that
struck down a Louisiana school board's disclaimer policy as a
violation of the constitutionally required separation of government
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action was not a precedent-setting decision but only a
denial of review.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas voted to hear arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Tangipahoa Parish school board in 1994 voted to require
teachers to tell students about to study the theory of evolution
that is ''presented to inform students of the scientific concept
and not intended to influence or dissuade the biblical version of
creation or any other concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimer drafted by the school board also said: ''It is
the basic right and privilege of each student to form his-her own
opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very
important matter. ... Students are urged to exercise critical
thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine
each alternative toward forming an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Three parents of students sued in federal court to challenge the
policy, and a federal judge blocked its enforcement. The judge said
the disclaimer was unconstitutional because it had a religious
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed that the disclaimer had to be struck down but cited a
different reason -- it had the effect of promoting religion.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not rule out the possibility that a school board
could require some type of disclaimer stating that evolution was
not the only accepted explanation of the origin of life. But it
said the Tangipahoa Parish disclaimer ''under the facts and
circumstances of this case ... is not sufficiently neutral'' to be
constitutionally permissible.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for the school board
argued that ''the mere mention of the biblical version of creation
by way of illustration does not present a significant risk of
perceived endorsement of Bible-based religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said reasonable high school or elementary students
would not interpret the disclaimer as a pro-religion message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central message of the disclaimer resolution is that there
are no outsiders or insiders, no one who is favored or disfavored,
on the issue of life's origin but persons of all viewpoints are
full members in the school community.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for those who challenged the disclaimer disagreed. ''By
disclaiming only evolution -- the one element of the school
curriculum that generates religious controversy -- the school board
has violated both the constitutional mandate of neutrality toward
religion and its obligation to provide its students with secular
educations free from religious indoctrination or partisanship,''
they said.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the disclaimer was drafted shortly after the
school board voted 5-4 to reject a proposal to teach
''creation-science'' in the district's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Creation-science teaches that Earth and most life forms came
into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago. Critics have
attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of the Book of
Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that Earth
is billions of years old, and that life forms developed gradually
several million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1987 barred states from requiring the
teaching of creationism in public schools where evolution is
taught, calling such a Louisiana law a thinly veiled attempt to
promote religion.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching of evolution has been controversial since the
famous 1925 ''monkey law'' trial in which teacher John Scopes was
convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution when Tennessee law
made it a crime to teach anything but the Biblical version of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Scopes' conviction later was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme
Court on a procedural matter, and never reached the nation's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education vs. Freiler,
99-1625.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court's three dissenters Monday, Scalia
criticized the court for standing by while an appeals court ''bars
a school district from even suggesting to students that other
theories besides evolution -- including but not limited to, the
biblical theory of creation -- are worthy of their consideration.''
