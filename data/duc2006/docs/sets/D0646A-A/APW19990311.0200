<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former Mouseketeer has been sentenced to  
two years in federal prison for using phony or bounced checks to 
buy investments and lying about it to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Darlene Fraschilla, who changed her last name from Gillespie  
after her January marriage, showed no emotion at Thursday's 
sentencing. She also must pay $6,144 in restitution and serve three 
years of supervised release. 
</P>
<P>
	She must report to prison by July 26. Mrs. Fraschilla, who was  
one of the nine original Mouseketeers on the Mickey Mouse Club 
television show from 1955-1959, had faced up to 90 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fraschilla said she plans to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted her in December on a dozen counts of  
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, obstruction of justice 
and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she helped her then-boyfriend, Jerry  
Fraschilla, in a scheme to buy more than 194,000 shares of stock 
valued at $827,000 in 1992 and 1993 by writing checks on closed and 
overdrawn accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla, 61, pleaded guilty to 21 counts of fraud last year  
and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and probation. He also was 
ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution.
