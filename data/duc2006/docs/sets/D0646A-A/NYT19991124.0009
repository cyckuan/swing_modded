   NEW YORK _ A former state parole commissioner was sentenced to
two years in prison Tuesday for lying to a federal grand jury
investigating allegations that New York Gov. George Pataki's
campaign aides promised early paroles in exchange for
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Sean McSherry, a former Bronx prosecutor,
violated a sacred public trust when he lied to a grand jury, and
his crime was more serious because he did so as a law enforcement
official, said Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to the heart of the administration of justice,'' she
said before pronouncing sentence. ``The public is entitled to
confidence that when a parole commissioner testifies, he will do so
truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   McSherry, 47, was convicted of perjury and obstruction of
justice in August. Prosecutors said he had lied to investigators
and then to a grand jury about a 1996 parole hearing at which a man
convicted of armed robbery was given early parole.
</P>
<P>
   The robber, John Kim, is the son of the Rev. Nam Soo Kim, who
made sizable donations to the 1994 Pataki campaign. A special
assistant to the state Parole Board, Ronald Hotaling, pleaded
guilty in August to lying to federal authorities who were
considering Kim's release.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Tuesday that their investigation was
continuing. No one in the Pataki administration has been charged in
connection with the investigation of accusations of influence
peddling, and Pataki has said no one received favors from the board
in exchange for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in 1997 after the parents of a man
convicted with Kim said that a Pataki campaign aide and a
Korean-American businessman had guaranteed that their son would
gain an early parole if they contributed to Pataki's 1994 campaign.
Investigators later found letters and memos from the governor's
office to the parole board concerning Kim and two other
Korean-American inmates whose families contributed to the Pataki
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other two inmates were not granted early paroles. The
three-member parole board, headed by McSherry, ordered Kim
released; he had served four years of a 4-to-12-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators questioned McSherry last summer about the
hearing, he told them he could not remember anything about it. When
he was called before a federal grand jury, though, McSherry stated
that he recalled a verbal dispute with a parole officer, one who
prosecutors later proved had been on vacation at the time of the
hearing. He also said he could not recall whether he had known the
governor's office had a special interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing McSherry, Judge Gershon said that he had lied to
investigators and ``volunteered an elaborate and false story''
during his two appearances before the grand jury. Noting that
McSherry said during his trial that he believed the events occurred
as he had testified and that he had not deliberately lied to
anyone, the judge added that ``the jury verdict clearly reflects
their disbelief of this assertion.'' McSherry's lawyer, Diarmuid
White, said he had filed an appeal in the case.
</P>
<P>
   His client is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 3
in a minimum-security federal prison.
