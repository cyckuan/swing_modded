   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man was sentenced Thursday to nearly six years
in prison for lying to a grand jury that was investigating the
World Trade Center bombing and related terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Elnore, 40, of Linden, N.J., had pleaded guilty to lying
to a grand jury in 1997 and 1998 that was investigating the 1993
World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more
than 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had the opportunity to be in front of the grand jury, I
would not make the same mistake,'' he said in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elnore also admitted lying when he said he had never heard of
Wadih El Hage, who is among the defendants charged with conspiring
to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998. The bombings
killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, and injured more
than 5,000.

   In a statement issued after the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary
Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''we will not allow
perjury or obstruction of justice to stand in the way of pursuing
justice for the victims of terrorism.''
