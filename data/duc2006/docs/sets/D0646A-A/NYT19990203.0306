FOR A `RIGHT HONORABLE' BRITON, A STEEP FALL FROM GRACE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   LONDON _ The distance between grace and disgrace is nowhere
greater than in Britain, where every rent in the shredding of a
reputation can be measured by a lost title, a black-balled club
membership, a fur-fringed ceremonial robe consigned permanently to
a hanger.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who enjoyed in abundance the favors with which
the British establishment has traditionally rewarded things like
good family background, Oxbridge education and the stylish exercise
of ambition was Jonathan Aitken.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a family of wealth and privilege and with angular good
looks to advertise it, Aitken, 56, was a member of Parliament, a
minister in the last Conservative Cabinet, a privy counselor to the
queen, a rake with enough glamorous conquests to earn him the
tabloid title ``Casanova of the Commons'' and a leader of wit and
intelligence that made him a rumored contender for future prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Today his likely future is in prison. Gone are his marriage, his
fortune, his seaside estate in Kent, his seat in Parliament, his
claim on the honorific Right Honorable and, most important, he
says, his good name. He is $3.5 million in debt and will have to
sell the 10-bedroom Georgian town house where he once posed for
soigne family portraits with his wife, son and twin daughters for
glossy celebrity magazines.
</P>
<P>
   His diplomatic passport has been confiscated, his remaining
assets have been frozen, and his gentleman's club, the Beefsteak,
says his case has prompted it to ponder the rare act of evicting a
member.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to perjury and intending to pervert
the course of justice for having drafted false testimony for his
teen-age daughter to give in court in his behalf. Afterward he
contemplated his ruination and the near certainty of jail at his
sentencing in June.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference befitting his breed, he said: ``As far as the
physical miseries go, I am sure I will cope. I lived at Eton in the
1950s, and I know all about life in uncomfortable quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad behavior in British cabinets is not an unusual thing. Twelve
ministers from John Major's government had to resign because of
financial or sexual transgressions, and four of Tony Blair's
principals have had to step down in the last three months. But a
collapse of Aitken's dimensions has not been seen since John
Profumo, the war minister in Harold Macmillan's government, was
caught lying to the House of Commons in 1963 and had to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The press typically chronicles these falls from grace with giddy
delectation, and in one of the many instances where Aitken's own
hubris got the best of him, he virtually made sure that none of the
many episodes would end up getting as much attention as his.
</P>
<P>
   Accused by The Guardian and a Granada TV documentary in 1995 of
accepting money from Arab arms dealers while he was Major's defense
procurement minister, Aitken threw down a now-infamous challenge to
the press. It is a moment that has been replayed on television here
in recent months as frequently as President Clinton's
finger-wagging denial of sex with Monica Lewinsky has run in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying himself as a reluctant crusader burdened by destiny,
Aitken said, ``If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the
cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the
simple sword of justice, and the trusty shield of British fair
play, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought a $3 million libel suit in the High Court, and his
polished performance on the witness stand was so convincing that
the newspaper and the documentary makers offered to settle out of
court. Aitken turned down the peace bid, saying it would compromise
his honor to meet with his tormentors, and he let the trial
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the newspaper uncovered airline and car rental
records that proved that Aitken was lying when he said his bill at
the Hotel Ritz in a 1993 visit to Paris was paid by his wife rather
than by a Saudi contact as The Guardian alleged. The documents
showed that she had in fact been in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Aitken withdrew his libel suit. His daughter Victoria, 17, was
subsequently arrested for having submitted false written testimony,
though prosecutors did not pursue her once it was clear that her
father had drafted the document and made her sign it. He was
charged with perjury, and his wife, Lolicia, said she was ending
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   His past caught up with him again in early January when DNA
tests revealed that he was the father of the 18-year-old daughter
of Soraya Khashoggi, the former wife of Saudi arms dealer Adnan
Khashoggi.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators have had to mine Shakespeare, Greek tragedies
and countryside morality tales to come up with parallels for what
the life of Jonathan Aitken promised and what it produced.
</P>
<P>
   His great-uncle was the newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, his
grandfather Lord Rugby, a distinguished colonial civil servant, and
his father, Sir William Traven Aitken, a Member of Parliament.
After Eton, he studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and during his
summer vacations he worked as a speechwriter for Selwyn Lloyd,
Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillan's government.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s he developed contacts in the Arab world,
created a financial services group and made his fortune. In 1974 he
entered Parliament and drew favorable attention with his right-wing
views that were coming into favor in the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   But party leader Margaret Thatcher refused to move him onto the
front benches. Among his high-profile romances was one with her
daughter, Carol, and when he abruptly ended the relationship, Mrs.
Thatcher reportedly told an associate that she would never promote
a man who ``made Carol cry.''
</P>
<P>
   She also had cause to resent him because of a brash answer he
had given an interviewer inquiring about her views of the Middle
East. ``I wouldn't say she is open-minded on the Middle East so
much as empty-headed,'' Aitken said in a widely quoted response.
``She probably thinks Sinai is the plural of Sinus.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 Aitken married a Swiss economist named Lolicia Azucki,
but his publicized affairs continued, including one with a
prostitute who later gave detailed accounts of his taste for whips
and canes. He finally made it into the government under Major,
becoming the government's arms purchaser, and then Treasury
secretary. He resigned in 1995 to fight his libel case.
</P>
<P>
   Aitken today claims religious conversion and speaks of his past
with unaccustomed contrition. ``Sometimes you become a prisoner of
your own lie,'' he told The Express the day after his plea.
``Ultimately, I have no excuses.''
