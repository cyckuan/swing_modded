<HEADLINE> British Man Convicted of Perjury  </HEADLINE>

   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) -- A man who was cleared of murdering
a woman more than a decade ago but later confessed to the killing
was convicted of perjury Friday and sentenced to six years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   William Dunlop, 36, had always denied killing Julie Hogg in a
frenzied sexual attack at her Billingham home in 1989. The jury in
his first trial failed to reach a verdict, and a formal verdict of
not guilty was returned after a second panel also could not come to
a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Hogg's family always believed Dunlop was guilty, but
he could never again be tried for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, while serving a seven-year sentence for a
serious assault on another woman, Dunlop told a prison officer he
had killed Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   He then was charged with two counts of perjury for giving false
evidence under oath at his two trials.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the sentencing at Teesside Crown Court in
Middlesbrough, northeast England, the Crown Prosecution Service
described the case as ''highly unusual.''
