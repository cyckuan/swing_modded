	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern running back Dennis Lundy  
admitted Friday that he intentionally fumbled near the goal line in 
a 1994 game to protect a bet he made against his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy also acknowledged he lied to a federal grand jury  
investigating gambling at Northwestern when he denied he had bet on 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy pleaded guilty to one count of perjury in a U.S. District  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted fumbling on purpose during the 1994 game against  
Iowa so his team would not cover the point spread and he would win 
a $400 bet. He also said he bet on Northwestern games against Ohio 
State and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate had accused Lundy of intentionally fumbling against  
Iowa to protect a bet. An assistant coach overheard the accusation 
and the school launched an investigation, which was quickly turned 
over to federal authorities and led to the indictments of Lundy and 
three other former players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal sentencing guidelines, Lundy would be sentenced to  
six months to a year in prison, but prosecutors will recommend less 
time as part of their plea agreement with him, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Mark Vogel said. Sentencing is scheduled for May 5 before 
U.S. District Judge David H. Coar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy must cooperate with authorities and speak to college  
athletes about the perils of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy was indicted Dec. 3 on perjury charges along with former  
players Christopher Gamble, Michael Senters and Gregory Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble pleaded guilty last month to lying to the grand jury. The  
others have pleaded innocent.
