 &HT;    Judge to testify on perjuryBy Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Judge Gerald Tjoflat testifies today before the
House Judiciary Committee about the consequences of lying under
oath, he will probably speak his mind and mince few words.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat, a Jacksonville judge who sits on the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has a reputation for being a
no-nonsense jurist. And his strongly worded ruling upholding a 1994
perjury conviction is nothing that ardent supporters of President
Clinton want to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We categorically reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise,
that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a civil
proceeding,'' Tjoflat wrote. ``Perjury, regardless of the setting,
is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the
functioning and integrity of the legal system as well as to private
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks said that with regard to perjured
testimony there is no gray area for Tjoflat, who has sat on the
federal bench for 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the typical straightforward and blunt way that he's famous
for, I'm sure he'll tell the committee that perjury is perjury is
perjury,'' Parks said. ``If you come in my court and you lie, you
infect the system and mess it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Parker, a former federal prosecutor who has argued
numerous cases before Tjoflat, predicted, ``With his commanding
presence and voice, he's the kind of guy who'll go up to Capitol
Hill and take no prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat is among six witnesses called by the committee
Republicans to testify in what may be the final hearing before the
panel votes on articles of impeachment against Clinton. Tjoflat
will be joined by Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican
congressman and a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco; two military officers; and two convicted
perjurers, including former University of South Carolina basketball
coach and Atlanta resident Pam Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have summoned five witnesses, including Harvard
University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Elliot Richardson, who
in 1973 resigned as attorney general rather than carry out
President Nixon's order to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat likely is being called to testify because he authored
one of the nation's strongest appellate opinions against perjury.
The 1994 ruling upheld the conviction of Ku Klux Klan grand dragon
David Wayne Holland of Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Holland and 10 other white supremacists had been sued in federal
court in Atlanta after they attacked civil rights marchers during a
1987 demonstration in Forsyth County, Ga. A federal jury assessed a
$450,000 judgment against Holland. He was later convicted of lying
under oath when asked whether he tried to hide his assets to
prevent the marchers from collecting on the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans believed the
federal sentencing guidelines called for Holland to receive lenient
treatment because he committed perjury in a civil _ and not a
criminal _ proceeding. But prosecutors appealed that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling that directed Evans to re-sentence Holland without
leniency with regard to the perjured testimony, Tjoflat noted that
Holland ``wilfully made material statements under oath that he knew
were false. . . . His actions needlessly consumed court time,
forced the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office to engage in
prolonged investigations and attempted to prevent private citizens
from satisfying their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hauptman, Holland's lawyer, said he believes Evans
correctly followed the sentencing guidelines. He also noted that
Tjoflat summarily rejected his challenge that Holland's conviction
be dismissed on claims of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Bard Tjoflat, who turns 69 on Sunday, was appointed to
the federal appeals court in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. During
the Korean War, he served as a special agent for the
counterintelligence corps and, over the years, he has been actively
involved in the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief judge of the 11-member appeals court in Atlanta,
Tjoflat is considered a moderate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat has testified previously before Congress, urging
lawmakers not to increase the number of judges on his court even
though appeals continue to skyrocket. More judges make confusing
law for the circuit and detract from the collegiality that's needed
to make the court function properly and smoothly, he said. As a
result, the 11th Circuit, which hears federal appeals out of
Alabama, Florida and Georgia, remains one of the nation's busiest
appeals courts in terms of cases decided per judge.
</P>
<P>
   Robust and full of energy, Tjoflat can bark like a marine
sergeant and is often seen with a haggard-looking law clerk at his
heels. He revels in telling a story or engaging in an argument,
often pausing to ask his audience, ``Do you follow?'' He can
dominate oral arguments before the court by peppering lawyers with
questions in an aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks his mind and has strong opinions,'' said Gary Myers,
a University of Mississippi law professor and former clerk for
Tjoflat's. ``He's very, very thorough. He's very good at looking at
the record and getting to the facts and to the details of the case.
That means he'll be a very well prepared witness before the House
Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Cohen, another former law clerk and now a George Mason
University law professor, said Tjoflat's ethics are beyond
reproach. The judge also has too much energy to take senior status,
to which he's entitled, Cohen said, recalling how Tjoflat could be
a stern taskmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen glumly recalls writing one draft after another for a
ruling in a major death-penalty case. Tjoflat sent them all back,
unsatisfied with each draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally came in to work on it one Saturday and he sat at
his desk and wrote the whole thing in long hand,'' Cohen said. ``My
job was to pass him sharpened pencils. It was not my most
ego-lifting experience, but it was a fine opinion.''
