PERJURY ISSUE POSES TANTALIZING DEAL FOR CLINTON

   WASHINGTON _ It seems like a tantalizing deal for the White
House. Some potential swing-vote Republicans say that if President
Clinton would admit he committed perjury when he said he had no
sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they would vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of the nation, I ask you to come forward, admit
that you lied under oath and indicate that you are prepared to face
the consequences of your actions,'' Representative Bob Franks, a
New Jersey Republican, wrote Clinton recently, suggesting such a
move would lead him to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton aides fear a trap. If Clinton makes such a
statement, they fear, then other Republicans might seize on it as a
rationale for impeachment, and a prosecutor might use it to indict
Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   All of this raises two key questions: Did Clinton commit
perjury? And if he did, is that an impeachable act? The answers may
well determine the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans say it is obvious that Clinton committed
perjury, noting that he flatly denied any sexual relationship with
Lewinsky. But the president's lawyers respond that Clinton's sworn
statement in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit was far short
of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff Wednesday once again refused to
say that Clinton lied, saying instead that ``the president engaged
in an exercise, a hallmark of which was a desire to be as little
help to people on the other side of the Jones case as he could.''
Ruff said that while Clinton may have walked ``up to the line'' of
lying, he was being truthful ``in his mind'' and ``that is the
heart and soul of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   That is significant because perjury is known as a crime of
intent. Perjury can only be proven if a prosecutor can show the
defendant intended to lie. But while White House aides believed
Ruff's argument against perjury was stellar, it may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that House members can vote for impeachment even
if they don't think Clinton committed perjury in the legal sense,
just as they can vote against impeachment even if they think
Clinton did commit perjury. That is because impeachment is a
political act, not a court case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides of that coin are at work here,'' said former
federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican who believes there
is ``no question'' Clinton committed perjury. ``You don't have to
prove a crime to impeach. And even if you believe it is not
technically perjury, you can vote to impeach anyway. This is the
question for the House.''
</P>
<P>
   While Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr has suggested there
are several instances of possible perjury, the main question is
whether Clinton lied under oath when he said he did not have sex
with Lewinsky. Clinton has said that his statement was ``legally
accurate'' because the definition of sexual relations used in the
Jones case was limited. While Clinton has never directly said that
his statement was accurate because he had oral sex with Lewinsky,
that is the rationale put forward by Clinton's lawyers. Oral sex
was not included in the definition of sexual relations used in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted
that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that
were included in the definition. For example, sexual relations was
defined in the Jones case as including ``contact with the
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report says Clinton did have such contact with
Lewinsky and lied about it. ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, the
president touched her breasts and genitalia, which means that his
conduct met the Jones definition of sexual relations,'' the Starr
report said.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that would fall within the definition of sexual
relations in the Jones case. The president has not directly
addressed this assertion by Lewinsky. Instead, Clinton's lawyers
have said that Clinton can't be charged with perjury based on the
testimony of a single contradictory witness. Since only Lewinsky
and Clinton witnessed their encounters, there is no way for a third
party to corroborate the extent of their contact.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Democrats have said the perjury case against
the president comes down to whether Clinton touched Lewinsky in a
certain manner. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, has mockingly noted the difference between the famous
Watergate-era question _ What did the president know and when did
he know it? _ and the current question of ``What did the president
touch and when did he touch it?''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Frank said that he believed the president lied when
he said in the deposition that he couldn't remember being alone
with Lewinsky. But if Clinton did lie, Frank said, then he was
alone with Lewinsky. And if he was alone with her, Frank continued,
then no one else could corroborate ``who touched what'' and thus no
one else could say whether Clinton committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans disagreed. Representative Bill McCollum, a
Florida Republican, said Lewinsky talked to seven other people
about her contact with Clinton. ``No matter what anyone else says,
to me that is corroboration,'' McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton did lie in the deposition, Democratic
Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said, that does not
necessarily mean he committed perjury. Meehan said that because
Clinton did not believe he was lying, and because the statements
were immaterial to the Jones case, the legal standard of perjury
was not met.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Meehan said in an interview that Clinton should
reconsider his refusal to say that he lied. Meehan said that in
addition to Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey, a crucial
number of swing-vote Republicans might oppose impeachment if
Clinton were to admit he lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are enough Republicans who feel that way'' and could
swing the vote against impeachment, ``then Clinton in all
likelihood will have to address it,'' Meehan said. ``The vote is
very, very close.''
