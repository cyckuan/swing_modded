EDITORIAL: THE THREAT OF POLICE PERJURY

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   Now that a former New York City police officer, Francis Livoti,
has been convicted in federal court of violating the civil rights
of Anthony Baez, the focus of investigation should move to the
officers accused of lying on the witness stand to protect Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of policy perjury made by federal prosecutors and a
state judge are devastating challenges to the integrity of the
Police Department that must be answered with utmost speed. The U.S.
attorney's office is looking into possible perjury and cover-up
charges. But the department must not wait for the federal
authorities to take the lead. It should begin an aggressive
investigation into the perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Baez died of asphyxiation during a confrontation with Livoti in
1994. Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in 1996
by a State Supreme Court justice, who nonetheless called the
testimony of the other officers a ``nest of perjury.'' Livoti was
dismissed from the department in 1997 after an administrative trial
found that he had used an illegal chokehold against Baez. None of
the officers accused of lying under oath, however, ever faced
administrative punishment or criminal charges, despite the
statement of the Bronx judge.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring inconsistencies in testimony in the federal case are
now too numerous for the department to brush aside. Three officers
testified that they saw Baez struggle and stagger, suggesting that
he was not rendered unconscious by the chokehold that the city's
medical examiner says was the cause of death. Yet other witnesses
contradict that account. The medical evidence suggests that the
story given by Livoti's defenders simply is not plausible. The
department must account for police testimony that was not believed
in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of the police is at the heart of two other
prominent brutality cases. The Daily News has reported that
accounts filed by detectives on the shooting of Antoine Reid, an
unarmed squeegee man, by officer Michael Meyer seem calculated to
protect Meyer by suggesting that the shooting occurred during a
robbery attempt. No such attempt was described by witnesses
interviewed by the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, which is
now investigating the discrepancy. Similar charges of a cover-up
are central to the inquiry into the attack against Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The department cannot protect the community if there is reason
to question the veracity of officers on the beat and on the witness
stand. A system in which officers who brutalize and kill civilians
are protected by other officers destroys the public trust and
erodes the ability of the force to do its job. Rooting out any
officer who gives false testimony must be made a top priority by
the department, the Mayor and prosecutors.
