   WASHINGTON _ In 1989, the Senate removed Judge Walter L. Nixon
Jr. of Mississippi from the bench for lying before a federal grand
jury. ``A single, discreet false statement,'' Sen &UR; . &LR;  Herb Kohl,
D-Wis., called it. But it was enough for the Senate to convict him,
89-8.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Senate removed Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Florida from office. A Miami jury had acquitted him of bribery
charges, but the Senate convicted him of lying when he testified in
his own defense at his trial. The Senate found him guilty of eight
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the House managers cited both impeachment trials, the
most recent to be held by the Senate, as they challenged the
senators to hold President Clinton to the same standards when they
judged him. The prosecutors implored the Senate to be guided by its
most recent precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard for integrity
for the president than the standard it has already established for
federal judges,'' Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' message was clearly intended for the Democrats
who voted a decade ago to remove both judges. They include Sens.
Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, John B. Breaux
of Louisiana, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   But two Republicans voted to acquit Nixon: Connie Mack of
Florida and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are striking similarities between the articles of
impeachment against the judges and those against the president,
there are also some differences, which the president's lawyers plan
to highlight in their opening argument next week.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against the judges involved lying about acts related
to their official duties. The presidents' lawyers argue that the
lies Clinton is accused of telling about his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky involved a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team also argues that the Senate should
apply a more rigid standard when it considers removing a popularly
elected president. A section of the Constitution says federal
judges ``shall hold their offices during good behavior.'' There is
no similar language about presidents.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in Congress, Gerald R. Ford noted the distinction in
a 1970 debate over an effort to impeach Associate Justice William
O. Douglas. He said there was a clear difference between judges,
who enjoy life tenure and are accountable for their misdeeds only
by impeachment, and presidents, who can be removed by the
electorate. The removal of a president in midterm ``would indeed
require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was removed from office, Nixon was in prison, serving a
five-year term. He had been convicted of lying to a grand jury when
he denied that he had influenced a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy oil man, Wiley Fairchild, had asked Nixon to intervene
in a drug case against Fairchild's son. Nixon persuaded the
prosecutor, an old friend, to dismiss the charges. In an interview
with federal agents, Nixon denied that he had had any involvement.
And he repeated those denials before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   After the conviction on two counts of perjury, the House passed
three articles of impeachment, charging the judge with making false
and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents.
The vote was 417 to 0. And in 1989, the Senate convicted Nixon of
perjury on two articles.
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Hastings was impeached and convicted, he had already
been acquitted by a jury in Miami of bribery charges. But the House
voted 413 to 3 to impeach him in 1988, approving 17 articles of
impeachment. Fourteen of them accused Judge Hastings of lying under
oath at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, 62, returned to the public stage, winning a Florida
seat in the House of Representatives. A Democrat, he voted last
month against impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also invoked the case of a Nevada federal judge,
Harry E. Claiborne, who was convicted of three articles of
impeachment and removed by the Senate in 1986 for filing false
income tax returns. Like Clinton's lawyers, the lawyers for
Claiborne argued that his actions had nothing to do with his public
duties and should not cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Cheating on your taxes has nothing to do
with being a judge,' '' Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of
the House managers, said Saturday. ``Do you know what the Senate
said? `It has everything to do with being a judge.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton's lawyers plan to argue that his grand jury
testimony about the details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
had nothing to do with his job as president.
