   LOS ANGELES -- Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Pasadena, used statistics
as a weapon against President Clinton on Friday, calling on his
experience as a prosecutor and judge to show punishment for perjury
is not nearly a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan told his colleagues during debate on the floor of Congress
that about 700 people have been convicted in federal court for
perjury-related crimes since Clinton became president, with 115 now
imprisoned. Later, he pointed out that the figures are much higher
on the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my home state of California, since Bill Clinton became
president, there have been some 16,000 prosecutions for perjury,''
Rogan told his colleagues. ``So the suggestion that perjury would
not be brought in an appropriate case is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials said Rogan's figures check out and
may even be a little low.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, in Ventura, Calif., on Friday, a man pleaded no
contest to a charge of perjury and faces up to four years in prison
on allegations he forged a veterinarian's name on wildlife
documents.
</P>
<P>
   While most perjury cases involve documents, people have been
prosecuted for such crimes as deceiving a grand jury on the witness
stand and lying about assets in a divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice reports there were 15,680
perjury prosecutions in the state between 1993 and 1997, and there
probably have been thousands more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern University law professor Robert Pugsley called
perjury an underprosecuted crime that was set up as a deterrent. In
light of recent events, he expects perjury will get a lot more
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine, at least in the short term, this Clinton deal
will stimulate a rash of perjury prosecutions and make people aware
of what perjury is,'' Pugsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a large chunk of the California prosecutions came
from Los Angeles County, where Rogan worked for six years in the
1980s as a deputy district attorney in the hard-core gang murder
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past five years, we have prosecuted several hundred
perjury cases,'' said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los
Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said most of them are perjury of document cases, in
which someone signs papers under penalty of perjury. Cases
involving witness-stand testimony are much more rare, Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, at the U.S. Attorney's Office, perjury cases have
been few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Justice statistician Jon Scalia said the federal
government undertakes about 130 perjury prosecutions per year
nationwide. There were 139 in 1997, with the average sentence at
about 27 months, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Thom Mrozek said he knows of
only two perjury prosecutions in the Central District, which covers
most of the Southland and is the largest district in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, nobody prosecuted in this office is in
custody for perjury charges,'' Mrozek said.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of perjury cases seems small -- less than 10
percent of state prosecutions and less than 1 percent of federal
prosecutions -- perhaps it's because they are very hard to
prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   To get a conviction, law enforcers need to prove:
</P>
<P>
   _ The defendant knew what he was asserting was false;
</P>
<P>
   _ He intended the information to be false;
</P>
<P>
   _ And the false information was material to the case.
