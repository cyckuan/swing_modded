   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Monday found President Clinton in
civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature
of his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a January 1998 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case, swore that he did not have a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky. Clinton later explained that he did not believe he
had lied in the case because the type of sex he had with Lewinsky
did not fall under the definition of sexual relations used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But US District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the
deposition, said in her ruling Monday that Clinton lied to her and
to Jones's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
the president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright ordered Clinton to pay Jones's legal expenses, which
could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, and she sent her finding
to the Arkansas bar, which could disbar Clinton. Clinton does not
face possible jail time because the contempt citation was issued in
a civil, not criminal, case.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt finding provided a measure of victory for House
Republicans who voted to impeach the president partly on grounds
that he committed perjury in the case. After the House voted for
impeachment, the Senate could not come up with the necessary 67
votes to convict Clinton and oust him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly now have a federal judge putting the president of
the United States in contempt for lying under oath, for committing
perjury,'' Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who is
running for president, said in an interview. ``That further
justifies the right vote to remove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Wright's decision is a long-overdue victory for the rule
of law,'' said Republican National Committee chairman Jim
Nicholson. ``It is a vindication of those who have known all along
that President Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican who first called
for Clinton's impeachment, said on CNN that the ruling was
``vindication'' of his effort but was not grounds for reopening the
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as minimal since the
judge had the option of citing the president for criminal contempt.
But the lawyers were keeping options open until they learn how
large a monetary penalty Jones might seek, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was surprised
when Jones's lawyers asked him whether he had sex with Lewinsky.
``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,'' Clinton
responded. He also said that he couldn't recall being alone with
her in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton's aides said that the president had oral sex with
Lewinsky, and they contended that this did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case. The
definition, for example, said that sexual relations includes ``an
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person'' and
contact with body areas such as breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who originally signed an affidavit saying she did not
have sexual relations with Clinton, eventually testified before the
grand jury that he did touch her body in areas that fell within the
definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors obtained a dress from Lewinsky that contained
Clinton's DNA material, the president testified before the grand
jury that he had an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky,
but he declined to describe the sexual nature of the relationship.
Clinton's lawyers later said during the impeachment hearings that
the president had come close to the line of lying, but had not
stepped over it.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who had indicated in a footnote to a September ruling
that she had doubts about the truth of Clinton's testimony, said
Monday: ``It is difficult to construe the president's sworn
statements . . . as anything other than a willful refusal to obey
this court's discovery orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally
false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally
false,'' Wright wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock, Ark.-based judge, who gave Clinton 30 days to
appeal the ruling, ordered that Clinton pay $1,202 to cover her
travel expenses for the Washington deposition on Jan. 17, 1998. She
gave Jones's attorney 20 days to submit legal expenses in the case,
which Clinton would be required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Wright dismissed Jones's sexual harassment complaint last year.
Clinton, rather than risk a successful appeal by Jones, paid the
former Akransas state worker $850,000 to drop the case. It is
likely that Clinton's legal defense fund, which is collecting money
to pay for the president's defense in his impeachment case, would
pay the costs associated with Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a Republican and former federal prosecutor,
said Monday that Wright's action underscored the depth of Clinton's
untruthful testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely serious penalty,'' diGenova said. ``It
reflects the degree to which the judge was personally offended by
the president's mendacity and manipulative behavior. For the
president of the United States, who is a lawyer, to be held in
contempt and have that referred to his state bar association for
possible additional sanction, that is a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, in her ruling, referred to the historic nature of her
decision, but added: ``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in
holding this nation's president in contempt of court.''
