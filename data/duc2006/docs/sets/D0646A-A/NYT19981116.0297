   A Texas judge was convicted of perjury for declaring that he had
used political contributions to buy flowers for his staff when, in
fact, the flowers went to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida postal supervisor is in prison for denying in a civil
deposition that she had a sexual relationship with a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio youth who was arrested for underage drinking testified
that he had never been read his rights by the police. He was then
convicted of perjury for lying and sent to jail for 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are
overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal
charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in
a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and federal
courts, and statistics on the number of perjury prosecutions
brought around the country, show that people are prosecuted in
America for what might be called small lies more regularly than the
Clinton defenders have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee's hearings into the possible
impeachment of the president set to begin this week. The
president's defenders are expected to return to their theme. The
president's lawyer, David Kendall, has said that ``no prosecutor in
the United States would bring a perjury prosecution on the basis''
of the kinds of questions Clinton was asked about his sex life in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with lawyers, legal experts and with a woman who
is serving a sentence for lying about sex in a civil case show
that, far from being shrugged off, the threat of prosecution for
perjury, even in civil cases, is a crucial deterrent in the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically, the sword of Damocles hangs over every
perjurer's head, and no one can know whether they're the perjurer
that's going to be prosecuted,'' said Jeffrey Abramson, a former
prosecutor and an expert on jury trials who is a professor of legal
studies and politics at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic on perjury prosecutions has been widely circulated
since the president's supporters began arguing that perjury was
little more than a technicality seized upon by the president's
enemies: Of 49,655 cases filed by federal prosecutors last year,
only 87 were for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   State courts, where statistics are harder to come by, are
another matter. Data supplied by court officials in two states,
California and New York, suggest that perjury prosecutions are not
as rare as some have suggested. In California alone last year,
there were 4,318 felony perjury cases. In New York there were 395
perjury cases last year. And even in the federal system, prison
officials said in October that 115 people were serving sentences
for perjury in federal prisons alone.
</P>
<P>
   The review of the cases offers some support for Clinton's
defenders. Perjury charges are brought in civil cases far less
frequently than in criminal cases. In addition, the law of perjury
is highly technical, with courts sometimes ruling that some
obviously misleading statements like those Clinton acknowledges
making may not constitute perjury under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But the cases also show that, even in civil cases, judges are
sometimes provoked by perjury more than by many of the evils they
see every day. In the Florida case of the postal supervisor in
July, the judge, Lacey A. Collier, sentenced the supervisor, Diane
Parker, to 13 months for falsely denying in a civil deposition that
she had a sexual relationship with a male subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most troubling things in our society today,''
Collier said, ``is people who raise their hands, take an oath to
tell the truth and then fail to do that. An analogy might be made
to termites that get inside your house. Nobody sees it, nobody
knows about it until the house collapses around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some courts have gone out of their way to say that perjury in
civil cases is as important as perjury in any other testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 civil suit in Georgia, for example, a founder of the
Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, David Wayne Holland,
was found liable for violating the rights of civil-rights marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Holland was convicted of perjury for lying about his
assets so the plaintiffs could not recover any of the $450,000 in
damages they had won. A federal judge in Georgia said the sentence
in the civil proceeding would be less severe than if Holland had
lied in a criminal case. The judge sentenced Holland to home
detention and community service.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, a federal appeals court criticized that ruling and
sent the case back for a sterner sentence. ``We categorically
reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise,'' the appeals court
judges said, ``that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a
civil proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The review of perjury cases also shows that, while lies about
sex are rarely the subject of perjury prosecutions, there are
precedents that come quite close to the allegations against
Clinton.
