   WASHINGTON _ Thomas Penfield Jackson seems a natural as a judge.
He's a big man, white haired, avuncular. But he did not seem a
clear natural for the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is hardly a technophile; he has been known to write
opinions longhand. And while the fast moving world of technology
demanded an equally fast-paced trial, Jackson got in trouble once
for allowing a trial to go on too long _ so long, in fact, that the
Court of Appeals ordered him to rule.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers said he administered the Microsoft trial
brilliantly. It was by far the most prominent, and probably the
most important trial of his career. And he got through it winning
plaudits from both sides for the innovative procedures that allowed
testimony to be completed in less than a year, when most major
antitrust trials have typically run on for nearly a decade. What is
more, as the trial proceeded, his knowledge of the computer
industry grew; he asked more and more technical questions that
demonstrated an ever firmer grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson once told a group of reporters who happened to share a
cab with him toward the end of the trial that he tried hard to sit
Sphinx-like on the bench, so no one could read anything into his
expressions. But at that one thing, at least, he failed.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching could see when he was bored, when he was
captivated by the testimony, when he was angry and when he was
amused. Some judges put on expressions deliberately, to manipulate
the audience. But Jackson seemed guileless.
</P>
<P>
   While he cautioned that no one should read anything into his
questions, comments, smirks and shrugs, the tenor of his behavior
usually left little doubt that Microsoft was not winning the day,
or the trial.
</P>
<P>
   His findings of fact bore that out. And given his history, it is
clear that he prepared them with attention and care. The Court of
Appeals rebuked him last year by overturning a previous ruling in a
related Microsoft case. That was hardly the judge's only reproval
from the higher court.
</P>
<P>
   But his findings of fact are almost bulletproof by their very
nature. Appeals courts essentially have no standing to question his
judgments about the credibility of the testimony before him. And
if, as expected, the conclusions of law and verdict hew closely to
these findings of fact, the judge's eventual ruling is more likely
to withstand appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Penfield Jackson was born in 1937 and grew up in
Kensington, Md., a pleasant, leafy, middle-class suburb of
Washington with Victorian homes and its own sense of community. His
father, Thomas Searing Jackson, was a prominent Washington lawyer
who started his own firm, Jackson &AMP; Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson attended St. Albans prep school in the early grades, on
a choir scholarship. But when his voice changed, St. Albans yanked
the scholarship and demanded full tuition. So Jackson was
transferred to a first-class public high school in Montgomery
County, Md. There he played football and was editor of the school
newspaper. He has said he once toyed with becoming a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spent his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, creating a
lifelong affiliation with the school. In fact, for several years he
headed Dartmouth's alumni association in Washington. After
graduation, he spent three years in the Navy, most of it aboard a
destroyer in the Mediterranean, and then attended Harvard Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he joined his father's firm as a civil and criminal
litigator. Among other cases, he defended several medical
organizations charged with malpractice and was often described as a
tenacious litigator.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he became politically active in Montgomery
County, an area so heavily Democratic that Republicans like Jackson
were ciphers. But the flip side was that it was easy for
Republicans to stand out and be noticed, as Jackson was. He came to
the attention of the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, which
he served as a lawyer in 1972 _ and avoided any taint from
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, his name was mentioned for a possible appointment to
the District of Columbia Superior Court or the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But he was not
chosen, and some lawyers at the time said he was not selected
because of his membership in the Chevy Chase Country Club, which
accepted no black members.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that was the reason, his membership was probably
viewed as impolitic for a judge presiding over trials of District
residents, most of whom were black. But that rejection turned out
to be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan White House clearly did not care about the club
membership. And two years later, in 1982, President Reagan
appointed him to a better position, on the U.S. District Court.
Like every judge in that courthouse, he has presided over his share
of interesting and important cases, including the 1988 trial of
Michael K. Deaver, the former top Reagan aide who was convicted of
lying under oath during an investigation of whether he had
improperly lobbied former White House associates.
</P>
<P>
   But his most prominent case, before Microsoft, was the trial of
the mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, on drug and perjury charges.
As in the Microsoft trial, he often interrupted the lawyers to ask
witnesses questions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheeda Moore, the former model who was used to lure Barry to a
hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack, referred several
times on the tape to ``Jell-O.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for
drugs, but neither the prosecution nor the defense thought to ask.
So Jackson spoke up to ask: Was Jell-O a secret word for drugs?
``No, unh-unh,'' Ms. Moore replied; she was merely talking about
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may not have believed that. In fact he had trouble with
the trial. Shortly after it ended, he complained in a speech to the
Harvard Law Forum that he thought ``four jurors were determined to
acquit regardless of the facts,'' adding that ``they obviously did
not tell the truth during jury selection when questioned about
possible bias.'' Jackson went on to say that the government had put
on a very strong case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the local paper Legal Times sent a reporter to spend a
day in his courtroom, to check stories floating around that he was
slow-moving. The reporter wrote that he took a two-hour lunch and
three ``10-minute'' breaks that each lasted half an hour. All in
all, the judge had spent 3 hours and 4 minutes on the bench, the
reporter wrote, while his breaks lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During the Microsoft trial, the judge scheduled a 90-minute
lunch break every day that usually lasted about 110 minutes. And he
had regular breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon, each of which
lasted about 20 minutes. Trial opened at 10 a.m. and generally
adjourned for the day about 4:20, though sometimes it went as late
as 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   So, generally, Jackson spent about four hours on the bench,
three hours on breaks. And given the highly technical nature of the
testimony, that was probably as much as he or anyone else could
handle. No one complained.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While on the bench, he gave the lawyers for both sides great
leeway to conduct their examinations as they chose, usually
overruling objections and only occasionally prodding the lawyers to
hurry up when he thought the examinations were plodding along in a
way that was of little use to him. This was appropriate since he
was hearing the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Jackson sails on the Chesapeake Bay and
reads, both fiction and nonfiction. He has been married three times
and has two grown daughters and two granddaughters. His wife, Pat,
is director of development at Sidwell Friends, a prep school in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial, of course, gave the judge more exposure,
more attention in the press, than he had ever had before. He
plainly was not comfortable with that. In 1997 he wrote a
commentary for a judicial conference that showed his view of the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between a potentially newsworthy case and the
press is roughly comparable to the relationship between a healthy
organism and an infectious disease,'' he wrote, adding: ``The
press, like all infectious diseases, is a predator. It will feed on
whatever it can find, including the host if its appetite is not
sated.''
