   WASHINGTON _ The first two impeachment articles that the House
will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. But he has declared repeatedly that
while his sworn testimony regarding the former White House intern
was misleading, it was not perjury. Following is a primer on the
issue:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   Black's Law Dictionary defines perjury as ``a false statement
knowingly made'' in a court proceeding about ``some matter material
to the issue or point in question.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to perjury, federal law also prohibits making false
statements on federal forms or to federal officers such as FBI
agents. Unlike perjury, this crime may be committed without a sworn
oath. Under federal law, perjury and false statements are
punishable by an undetermined fine, up to five years in prison or
both.
</P>
<P>
   ARE PERJURY PROSECUTIONS COMMON?
</P>
<P>
   Out of 49,655 prosecutions in federal courts in 1997, 87 were
for perjury. In state courts such prosecutions are more common.
California, for instance, had 4,318 perjury cases among 326,768
felony prosecutions last year.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES THE SUPREME COURT SAY ABOUT PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in 1973 that while witnesses under oath must
tell the truth, they are not required to fill in the blanks. They
may answer questions narrowly as long as the answers are truthful.
In that case, Samuel Bronston, a movie producer whose company went
bankrupt, had been convicted of perjury for giving misleading,
though technically truthful, answers about his Swiss bank account.
The Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE PERJURY CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT CLINTON?
</P>
<P>
   The specific allegations contained in Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress refer to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit that he ever had a ``sexual affair,'' a
``sexual relationship'' or ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
``Sexual relations'' were defined as ``when (a) person knowingly
engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's insistence in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony that
his Jan. 17 answer narrowly fit the definition of ``sexual
relations'' presented to him. During the Aug. 17 testimony, Clinton
acknowledged having ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's vague recollections in his Jan. 17 deposition on
whether he had ever been alone with Lewinsky and his statements
minimizing the number of gifts the two exchanged. Starr's report
cited 10 sexual encounters in the White House and the exchange of
about 50 gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's failure to be specific in his deposition when asked
about his conversations with Lewinsky around the time she was
called to be a witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against him. In the Starr report, Lewinsky testified that she and
Clinton discussed her involvement in the Jones case in detail at
least four times. In a 2 a.m. phone call from Clinton Dec. 17,
1997, he allegedly told her, ``You know, you can always say you
were coming to see Betty (Currie, Clinton's secretary) or that you
were bringing me letters.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's failure to recall whether his close friend,
Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, had ever talked to Lewinsky about
her involvement in the Jones case. Jordan, who in late 1997 tried
to find Lewinsky a job in New York, told the grand jury he kept
Clinton fully informed of all his efforts on Lewinsky's behalf,
including finding her a lawyer after she was subpoenaed in the
Jones case on Dec. 19, 1997. On Jan. 7, Jordan told Clinton that
Lewinsky had signed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE REPUBLICANS' ARGUMENT ON THE PERJURY CHARGES?
</P>
<P>
   They say Clinton perjured himself by playing word games with the
definition of ``sexual relations.'' The definition was broad enough
to include oral sex, and Clinton's denial that he touched or
stimulated Lewinsky was contradicted by Lewinsky. Second, his vague
recollections on being alone with Lewinsky, exchanging gifts and
other matters amounted to perjury because he knew when he testified
in the Jones deposition that he and Lewinsky had been alone
repeatedly, that they had exchanged numerous gifts and that he had
several conversations with her and Vernon Jordan over her's role in
the Jones case. House Judiciary Committee Republicans used
Clinton's more forthcoming Aug. 17 grand jury testimony to point up
discrepancies in the Jan. 17 deposition. For instance, Clinton said
in the deposition, ``I'm not sure'' when asked whether he talked to
Lewinsky about her testifying in the Jones case. But in his grand
jury testimony, he admitted he spoke to Lewinsky about it when she
visited him at the White House on Dec. 28, 1997. In his deposition,
Clinton said he had ``no specific recollection'' of being alone
with Lewinsky. But in his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged
being alone with Lewinsky on repeated occasions.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS CLINTON'S DEFENSE?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders say he did not lie under oath but that even
if he did, untruths uttered to hide an extramarital sexual affair
do not rise to the level of offenses so severe that impeachment is
warranted. Clinton has said he believed ``sexual relations''
referred to sexual intercourse, and not oral sex. His lawyers cite
five dictionary definitions to back him up. ``This interpretation
may be confusing to some,'' Clinton's lawyers said in a 184-page
legal defense submitted to the Judiciary Committee. ``It may be
counterintuitive. It may lead to bizarre answers. But it certainly
was not objectively wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also contends that Starr and House Republicans
have mischaracterized Clinton's testimony on subjects such as his
being alone with Lewinsky. Clinton answered ``yes'' when asked
whether it was possible he was alone with Lewinsky. On gift giving,
Clinton invited the Jones lawyers to list specific gifts so he
could confirm or deny any exchanges. After the lawyers named a few,
Clinton recalled giving Lewinsky something from the Black Dog, a
restaurant on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. On the question
of whether he discussed Lewinsky's possible testimony in the Jones
case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, White House lawyers argue that
Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest
perjury by Clinton. For instance, the Starr report says Clinton
answered, ``I don't think so'' when asked whether anyone besides
his lawyers told him that Lewinsky had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case. The report, White House lawyers argue, leaves out Clinton's
next answer that Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey first
told him.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff acknowledged to Judidicary
members that in the Jones deposition, Clinton ``walked up to the
line'' of perjury, and ``reasonable people ... could determine that
he crossed that line.'' But Ruff added that the president was
convinced he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   CAN CLINTON EVER BE PROSECUTED FOR PERJURY?
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution says that impeachment and removal from office
are no bar to criminal prosecution afterward. However, a White
House-selected panel of former prosecutors and legal scholars told
the Judiciary Committee last week that the case for perjury against
Clinton was too weak to bring before a jury.
