<HEADLINE> Hiss Grand Jury Records Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citing their historical relevance and the  
public's right to know, a judge ordered the release of thousands of 
secret grand jury papers in the Cold War-era perjury case against 
Alger Hiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old papers are thought to reveal key information  
about one of the most disputed episodes of the era. Hiss, a key 
government aide, was accused of spying for the Soviet Union in 
1948, but was tried on perjury charges when the statute of 
limitations for espionage expired. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to prison for three years in 1951 and died in 1996  
at age 92, still maintaining his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Access to such information inevitably enhances the accuracy of  
history and undermines the false conspiracy theories and 
revisionism that tend to arise when information remains secret,'' 
U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure said in his ruling Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision could give historians a legal precedent to open  
grand jury records in other significant cases. Grand jury 
proceedings are normally secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss' son, Tony, praised the judge's ruling, saying his father  
hoped ``the full truth would be disclosed and people could see for 
themselves that he had always been an honorable and patriotic 
public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government fought hard to keep the 3,500 pages of  
testimony secret. Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary 
Jo White, said prosecutors had not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss, a former State Department aide, was convicted of perjury  
for lying to the grand jury in a case that lifted a 
Communist-hunting Richard Nixon, then a young congressman, to 
national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	In challenging the release of the papers, the government argued  
that there was no legal precedent to make such material public and 
that grand juries are less inhibited when they act in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leisure said he found the government's opposition perplexing  
because no national security interest was asserted and barely any 
privacy concerns were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, White called the rules safeguarding the  
secrecy of grand jury proceedings ``among the most important in our 
criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules do not contain an exception for historical interest,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. Vladeck, director of the Public Citizen Litigation  
Group, the legal arm of Ralph Nader's organization that fought for 
the papers' release, said Leisure's ruling ``marks the first real 
inroads into the idea that grand jury records ought to be kept 
secret forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those backing the opening of the files were conservative  
editor William F. Buckley and John Earl Haynes, a Library of 
Congress historian and co-author of several books on the Cold War 
and American Communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Hiss, a visiting scholar at New York University's Taub  
Urban Research Center, said his father was not bitter about Nixon's 
role in his prosecution or about his years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always thought of Nixon as a young politician on the rise.  
He didn't think Nixon had anything personal against him, that he 
just saw an opportunity to advance,'' Hiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prison life taught his father to appreciate ordinary  
aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used to like to say to me that three years in prison is a  
good corrective to three years in Harvard,'' Hiss said.
