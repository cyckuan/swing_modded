<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Big Pyramid Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Syracuse businessman Patrick Bennett was  
convicted Thursday of charges that he orchestrated a huge pyramid 
scheme and was immediately sent to prison by a judge who said he 
had proven he ``has absolutely no respect for any law of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of cheating more than 22,000  
investors out of $700 million in a case spanning two trials in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The first jury to hear the case convicted Bennett of perjury and  
obstructing a federal investigation of his company but could not 
reach a verdict on the rest of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He committed gross fraud. He committed perjury in every stage  
of the proceeding. ... Clearly this trial has showed that Patrick 
R. Bennett is a total amoral individual who engaged in any criminal 
conduct that benefits him in any way,'' U.S. District Judge John S. 
Martin Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came after a jury found Bennett, 46, of Vernon,  
N.Y., guilty of 42 counts, including securities fraud and money 
laundering. The jury did not reach a verdict on 11 counts, 
including the most serious charge of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Smith said Bennett faces  
at least 20 years in prison, in part because he had been convicted 
of laundering at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Smith said, Bennett continued to live lavishly on a  
100-acre horse farm in his wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawns are freshly mowed, there are horses galloping in the  
pasture, and you have to really ask where did that money come 
from,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's convictions, bail was revoked and Bennett was  
ordered taken into custody pending sentencing Sept. 13. He stood in 
court along with his wife, both of them sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of using Bennett Funding Group  
to entice investors in 46 states into investing in leases for 
office equipment that sometimes did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett then pocketed more than $13 million for himself, buying  
Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse, prosecutors said. They 
alleged he also spent lavishly, including $19 million for a 
gambling barge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had admitted that he lied to the Securities and Exchange  
Commission after the watchdog agency began investigating the 
company in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The lies, prosecutors said, stalled the SEC until March 1996,  
causing investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's verdict shows that Patrick R. Bennett conducted  
perhaps the largest financial fraud in United States history,'' 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement. ``This scheme was 
particularly egregious because it victimized thousands of investors 
who believed the investments were among the most secure available 
in our securities markets.''
