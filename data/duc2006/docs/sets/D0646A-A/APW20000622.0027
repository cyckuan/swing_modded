<HEADLINE> Officer Convicted in Louima Case  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- A policeman was convicted Wednesday of lying to
investigators to avoid becoming a ''rat'' in the case against
patrolmen who tortured a prisoner in a precinct house's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated two days in Brooklyn federal court before
delivering a split verdict, finding Francisco Rosario guilty of two
counts of conspiring with his partner to make false statements to
the FBI six weeks after the 1997 assault of Abner Louima. He was
acquitted of a third count that charged he lied again in a later
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario became the sixth officer to either be convicted at trial
or plead guilty in one of the worst brutality scandals in city
history. The 1997 attack on Louima, a black Haitian immigrant,
sparked protests and prompted a Justice Department investigation
into whether the New York Police Department fosters abuse of
minorities by not cracking down on excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had accused Rosario of lying because he ''did not
want to be labeled a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Levitt said Rosario would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario faces up to five years in prison; no sentencing date was
set.
