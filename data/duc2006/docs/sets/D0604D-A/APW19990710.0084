<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Film Opens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Brandishing light sabers, Japanese ``Star Wars''  
fans welcomed the opening Saturday of the hit film in the land 
credited with inspiring the saga. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds lined up as early as Friday morning at select theaters  
for a special countdown ceremony for the arrival of ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some wore costumes of Darth Vader, Yoda and other ``Star Wars''  
characters. And the crowd broke out into a cheer when the film 
finally began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special effects are so awesome,'' said Shingo Oyama, a  
19-year-old college student, lining up with a friend outside a 
Tokyo theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others, Oyama has seen all three previous ``Star  
Wars'' films and was dead set on seeing the latest on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's makers have made no secret that the work owes much to  
Asian influences: the kimono-like costuming, the sword-fighting 
scenes, the Kabukiesque makeup, and, of course, the epic fable of 
good vs. evil. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, who came to Japan in person last month to  
plug the film, is an avid fan of the late Japanese filmmaker Akira 
Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Asian-Americans have complained about stereotyping. But the  
Japanese haven't minded a bit, seeming to see it all as an honor. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, TV shows here have featured hype on the film,  
sometimes showing off ``Star Wars'' products like action figures 
and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Die-hards, who couldn't wait to see the movie, went all the way  
to the United States, where it opened May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	With such anticipation, the arrival of the film at more than 400  
theaters nationwide was a jubilant affair. At the Miyukiza theater 
in Tokyo more than 1,000 people packed three showings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were clapping from joy, shaking their light sabers,''  
said theater employee Akinari Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all gave the film a thumbs-up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The visual effects were fantastic, but there wasn't much  
content to the story,'' said Shinichiro Oka, a 31-year-old computer 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, seeing `Star Wars' is an important thing to do. It was  
worthwhile.''
