`STAR WARS' BATTLES TO A DRAW: BREATHTAKING ANIMATION SERVES
FLAT  HUMAN STORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Does any adventure series have a greater _ and more supremely
deserved _ reservoir of good will going for it than ``Star Wars''?
</P>
<P>
   At a preview screening last week in San Francisco, the keyed-up
audience for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' cheered
the dimming of the lights before the film even began.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered the Lucasfilm logo. They even cheered Rupert (talk
about an evil empire!) Murdoch's 20th Century Fox logo. They
cheered the slogan ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, there were more cheers at the beginning than
there were, almost 2 1/4 hours later, at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Right off the bat, Ewan McGregor, as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi,
echoes Han Solo's ``I have a bad feeling about this.'' It would be
merely clever and terribly unfair to say ``Star Wars'' fans might
share that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``The Phantom Menace'' worth seeing? What a question! Of
course it is. It is a stunning spectacle, maybe even Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic's greatest special-effects achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But creator George Lucas has left a lot of room for improvement,
particularly for character development and emotional juice, in this
beginning of the second trilogy. We have every right to assume _ to
demand _ that the next two episodes will accomplish exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there are high hopes for a promise not yet fully
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The most distinctive thing about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which
opens Wednesday, is the extraordinary degree to which it is
animation _ far, far and away more so than any previous ``Star
Wars.'' An accurate categorization of it would be sci-fi,
live-action animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   From richly imagined new computer-generated characters who
interact uncannily with the human actors to a strategically paced
bonanza of extended, huge-scale, self-contained sequences, the
computer-generated animation is a marvel of solidity, density,
color subtlety and 3-D depth. It is truly out there.
</P>
<P>
   The action introduces us to Anakin Skywalker, the 9-year-old we
already know will become not only Darth Vader but also the father
of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Two Jedi knights, dispatched
as ambassadors to broker peace between the intergalactic Trade
Federation and the idealistic planet Naboo, believe that they have
discovered along the way the Chosen One who will bring the galaxy
into equilibrium with the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Force?
</P>
<P>
   It's not the seat-rattling sound that rumbles through the
theater when spaceships accelerate, but it could've fooled me.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer-generated creature Jar Jar Binks also brings
off the illusion. A buddy of Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam
Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), Jar Jar kind of fills the
Chewbacca vacuum. He has droopy ears, bulging eyes on stems and a
humanoid torso. He's got an anteater's wandering tongue and a
hipster's walk, put to delightful use in a dance of celebration
with New Orleans-style prancing droids.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically in ``The Phantom Menace,'' the animated characters
have more human juice to them than the live ones. The humans,
low-key and one-dimensional, are the stick figures. This new
trilogy needs a lovable rascal like Han Solo and a bitchy, bossy
princess like Leia _ somebody to set off some sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The stolid Neeson is warmer than anyone has a right to expect,
and even his Buddhist platitudes (``Be mindful of the moment'') are
never burdensome. My favorite: ``The ability to speak does not make
them intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing message is: We must learn to help one another.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor is more of a problem. As the living prequel to the
saint of the series, in a brush cut with a topknot that seems to
have slipped down the back of his head, McGregor seldom shows his
natural vivacity as an actor and, especially, his unpredictability.
An Alec Guinness imitation is interesting only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman has grown up from the 11-year-old urchin in Luc
Besson's ``The Professional'' and now is a regal, perhaps too
regal, queen of Naboo and something of a clothes horse. One of her
costumes recalls the Elizabethan age, and another is very Japanese.
She has one stripe of lip gloss on her lower lip, and it's likely
that teenage girls already are imitating it. There are some shocks
and surprises along the way, and Portman is involved in one of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), to my
mind, is what planted the seeds that led to his embracing the dark
side of the Force as Darth Vader. As yet, we don't know. A slightly
younger but still wispy-haired Yoda says that ``fear is the path to
the dark side,'' but the Anakin we see is resourceful and brave.
</P>
<P>
   He's already involved in the creation of a see-through C-3P0
droid, and the nearby prototype of R2-D2 is greeted by the audience
like an old friend. Fighter-pilot son Luke will be a chip off the
old block, as we see in Anakin's entry in the pod race. The cab of
his aircraft, by the way, sometimes hangs behind the free-floating
jets and, in the twists and turns through canyons, sometimes
precedes them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The battles and other set pieces, such as the pod race, go off
like a carefully timed string of firecrackers. The
computer-generated landscapes, cityscapes and seascapes are
awesome. An underwater city is surrounded by an increasingly
ripping series of marine monsters that sequentially gobble each
other up. ``There's always a bigger fish,'' Neeson observes drily.
</P>
<P>
   The cityscapes range from pre-Mayan and Babylonian to Venetian
canals and the precipitous, illuminated towers of skyscrapers. One
battle takes place on an enormous plain, and a climactic lightsaber
fight is waged among ramps, platforms and infinitely deep
crevasses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the creatures are ants-on-their-hind-feet cannon fodder
called battle droids. Another new one is the greedy, winged slave
master of Anakin. His bet with Qui-Gon Jinn leads up to the pod
race. The ever-resourceful Jedi knight has a jujitsu-like knowledge
of how to let an opponent defeat himself.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory scene, a hallmark of Lucas' films and, I think,
of his philosophy, features some of John Williams' new music, which
otherwise tends to fade from consciousness with overfamiliarity.
</P>
<P>
   Jar Jar, by the way, sometimes seems to sound like the Central
American houseboy in Robin Williams' ``The Birdcage.'' There are
other intriguing dialect choices, such as the Federation reps who
seem to speak English with a Mandarin accent.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's show started, a representative of the publicity
agency presenting the screening asked audience members to report
any camcorders they spotted among them. Piracy is a serious
international problem, of course, but anybody who sees a shaky copy
of ``The Phantom Menace'' on a small screen with tinny sound is
missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the ``special edition'' remake of Episodes IV, V
and VI, adding landscapes and cityscapes to put the action in a
more believable context, must have arisen during creation of the
extraordinary environment for ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   People may have forgotten how low-rent and underpopulated the
original ``Star Wars'' was in 1977, with its tacky sets and ragtag
little kids disguised in hoods.
</P>
<P>
   In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy,
not yet.
