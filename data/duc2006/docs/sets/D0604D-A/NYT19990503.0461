   DENVER _ There were a lot of storm troopers wandering around
without their blaster guns at the ``Star Wars'' Celebration here,
the first convention and exposition dedicated to the 22-year-old
movie series to win the approval and support of the films' creator,
George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Through a strange twist of fate, the ``Star Wars'' Celebration
landed in Denver on the same weekend as the National Rifle
Association convention, which drew 7,000 protesters, and just 10
days after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, a
suburb 20 minutes away. It was food for thought, not least because
the ``Star Wars'' movies _ whose ``dark side'' leans heavily on the
iconography of the Third Reich, an obsession of the Columbine
killers _ are filled with the kind of shoot-'em-up entertainment
fantasy that many citizens are blaming for society's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention, which drew about 40,000 fans to the
Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum here Friday to Sunday,
the specter of Columbine hung over the event like the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   A petition was circulated urging Decipher, the company that
makes the ``Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game, to create a card
depicting one of the slain students, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars''
fan named Steven Curnow, as a Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   A Decipher spokesman said the company declined ``because other
kids would start thinking it's fun to kill him with a blaster''
during game play. Eric Harris, one of the two students who planned
and died in the Littleton attack, included a rant on his Web site
about things he hated, including ``Star Wars'' fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the booth run by Star Wars Insider, the official fan club
magazine, which organized the convention, action figures with guns
were no longer for sale. Dan Hogatt, a 30-year-old foreman at Ford
Motor Co. in Louisville, Ky., who dressed up as a very convincing
Chewbacca complete with a fur head and suit, foam latex hands and
drywall stilts that boosted his height to 8 feet, had to check his
crossbow at the door. (Light sabers were deemed permissible.)
``They asked us not to bring our weapons in here,'' he said. ``And
I was upset, but I totally understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the search for answers to the Littleton tragedy, convention
goers turned to their favorite film. One speaker told the audience
to always remember the Columbine events and a quote from Yoda that
appears in a trailer for the forthcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menance.'' (The first movie in the new trilogy is set a
generation before the first three ``Star Wars'' films.) ``Fear is
the path of the Dark Side,'' the green Zen master says. ``Fear
leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end the anticipation that the first ``Star Wars''
prequel would be in theaters in less than three weeks _ on May 19,
a date more anxiously awaited than the millennial New Year's Eve
for most of these fans _ snapped fans out of tragic reality and
into happy fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Some had overcome hardship to attend the celebration. A dying
father from the East Coast took his wife and young children, hoping
that he could give them one last fond memory of being together as a
family. And Joshua Hamilton, a 26-year-old from Denver who works
for a publisher of comic books, wandered through the exhibition
center with his forehead lacerated with fresh cuts, a result of a
car crash just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car was totaled,'' said his wife, Kimberly. ``The
ambulance came and put him in a neck brace and strapped him to a
board. They X-rayed both of us at the hospital and said we were OK.
It was worth it. This is a once in a lifetime event.''
</P>
<P>
   As films and personalities race through pop culture leaving a
trail of momentary obsession behind them, ``Star Wars'' has passed
the test of time and has spanned generations. It has worked its
epic tale of the relationships between good and evil, father and
son, man and machine, youth and maturity, and thinking and feeling
into a cultural landmark. Joseph Campbell (whose book ``The Hero
With a Thousand Faces'' seems to have inspired the galaxy-saving
journey of Luke Skywalker) has been perhaps the films' greatest
ally, examining it as a myth as universal as the Upanishads or the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a religion,'' said Won Park, a watercolor
artist who flew in from Honolulu and dressed up as the Jedi master
Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in ``Episode I''). ``If
George Lucas turned this into a religion, it would blow L. Ron
Hubbard's Dianetics out of the window.'' Hubbard, of course, was a
science-fiction writer before he led the Church of Scientology.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Michael Cruz, a 24-year-old fan from New York City with
seven ``Star Wars'' tattoos and a wife in her eighth month of
pregnancy, said they were waiting to watch ``Episode I'' to select
a name for their baby.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people feverishly wandering through the tents and
airplane hangers housing ``Star Wars'' toy and video game previews,
glass-encased movie props and collectible merchandise seemed to fit
the stereotype of geeky males in their 20s and early 30s. But the
convention drew a racially, sexually, ethnically and generationally
mixed crowd, many in costume although inexplicably there was nary a
Luke Skywalker or C-3PO in sight. It was hard to tell whether a
parent or a child was the ``Star Wars'' fan, and often the answer
was both.

   Most of these conventioneers inhabit an alternate world in which
George Lucas is God. The universe of ``Star Wars'' is one of his
making, the quality of its images and products rigorously
maintained and controlled by his company over the years. The tale
itself _ a fantasy rendered with elaborate realism down to the last
planet, droid and Gungan, each of which has its own background
story _ was created with the kind of methodical obsession with
detail that is the hallmark of an Outsider artist like Henry
Darger.
</P>
<P>
   In his Chicago apartment several decades ago, the reclusive
Darger typed 15,000 single-spaced pages and drew 300 oversize
water-colors carefully detailing of the plight of young slave girls
in outer space and the battle between their captors, the
Glandelinians, and their protectors, the Abbennians, along with all
kinds of supplemental characters and species. The battle myth could
have attracted a ``Star Wars''-like cult complete with
corresponding action figures. But without the benefit of mass
entertainment it attracted only one fan in the artist's lifetime:
Darger himself.

   Lucas has the gift of being as focused on the commercial reach
of his work as he is on its inner world. Of the more than 30,000
``Star Wars'' products _ a $4 billion business with rarities that
fetch as much as $25,000 in the case of one Boba Fett action figure
that shoots projectiles that may land in the throats of young
children _ every one has been approved by Lucasfilm.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, merchants like Hallmark and Hasbro lucky
enough to receive a Lucasfilm license showcased their official
products _ from blow-up pool rafts shaped like Naboo Starfighters
to toothbrushes emblazoned with the likeness of the new character
Jar Jar Binks _ as if they were fragments of the lost ark.

   ``Don't videotape,'' a representative in a ``Star Wars'' costume
shop told one fan. ``Next thing you know, it will be on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why anyone would care to post images of costumes of
familiar characters on the Internet, the representative replied,
``I don't know, they told me to say that,'' ``they'' referring to
Lucasfilm officials. ``It's all been hush-hush.'' Merchants were
under strict orders not to sell or even discuss merchandise from
the forthcoming movie, some of which conveniently went on sale in
stores on Monday, the day after the convention ended. The
convention may have been a way to repay diehard fans, as editors at
Star Wars Insider said, but it was also a way to stick them with
the bill by waving new collectibles under their noses.

   ``I placed my orders without knowing what the product was going
to look like,'' said Kyle Puttkammer, owner of a store called
Galactic Quest in Atlanta. ``But now that I've seen them, I'm going
to increase my order.'' As he spoke, passers-by paused to take
photos of Puttkammer, who was dressed as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and his 10-month-old daughter, dressed as Yoda, in her stroller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes
from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend
question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film,
including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and
the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick
McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of
C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. August was actually asked what it felt like to be the
grandmother of Luke Skywalker. ``Star Wars'' buffs may be able to
distinguish between fantasy and reality, but it was clear which
side they preferred. When an audience member asked Park whether his
character, the devilish-looking, double-light-saber-wielding Darth
Maul, would be returning in Episode II, the audience broke into
confused murmurs. ``What do you want to hear?'' asked the master of
ceremonies, Daniels. ``The truth or a lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Roaring through the tent came the overwhelming reply of over a
thousand fans screaming in unison, ``A lie!''
