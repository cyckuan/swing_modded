	TOKYO (AP) -- Kabuki-style makeup. Samurai-style swordplay. A  
director who confesses a love for the work of Akira Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' space fantasy series holds a special appeal  
for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic 
samurai films. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The  
Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by 
Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal  
warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the 
design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style 
swordplay, albeit with lightsabers. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, in Tokyo on Wednesday to plug the new  
film, acknowledged his debt to Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a master that you work toward (hoping) that someday  
you can reach that level,'' Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, audiences here won't get a look at the film until  
opening day, July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened in  
the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in 
many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Japanese fans, that's just too much to ask.  
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshi Kobayashi, a 27-year-old graduate student whose business  
card reads ``Star Wars Evangelist,'' was one of 30 Japanese fans 
who flew to Los Angeles last month to see the new film. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of Japanese subtitles made the dialogue hard to follow,  
but he still gave it a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a great visual impact,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After its release in the United States, ``The Phantom Menace''  
earned more than $205 million in a record 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts here are optimistic. Most expect it to go over  
well with the Japanese audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshio Furusawa, 20th Century Fox's marketing director in Japan,  
said pre-release ticket sales have been strong and that demand for 
4,000 passes to a ``Star Wars'' fan event held last month exceeded 
availability by 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie looks like it was made for audiences in Japan,''  
said Japanese film critic Yuichi Tanuma, who attended a special 
showing for the media last month in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``The Phantom Menace'' has touches of Japanese influence  
in the Kabuki-style facial makeup sported by the evil Darth Maul 
and Zen-like meditation practiced by the heroic Jedi knights.
