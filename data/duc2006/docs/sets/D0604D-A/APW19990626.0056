<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Mania Hits Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Star Wars mania has struck in Japan, where fans  
turned out in droves at theaters around the country Saturday for a 
sneak preview of the hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in costume and others toting light sabers, the movie-goers  
began lining up as early as Thursday to see ``Star Wars: Episode I 
-- The Phantom Menace'', which officially opens on July 10, more 
than five weeks after its U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a festival,'' said Yuki Nishijima, a 19-year old  
student who had been waiting seven hours for one of three 
late-night showings at the Nihon Gekijo theater in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Around him, hundreds of people sat in the theater's sweltering  
entryway, fanning themselves and passing the time with everything 
from backgammon to beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, the world's second largest movie market, is home to  
legions of Star Wars fans, and the film has been heavily hyped by 
the media in the weeks leading up to its first showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the  
Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was based loosely on ``The Hidden  
Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Akira 
Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize this has sort of become a media event,'' said  
Chitose Koike, a 37-year old pianist who was waiting to see the 
sneak-preview. ``But I wanted to see it before everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nihon Gekijo officials said advance ticket sales had already  
surpassed previous records for the theater.
