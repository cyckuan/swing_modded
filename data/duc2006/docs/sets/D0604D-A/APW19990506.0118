	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Now that a few people have actually seen the  
new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded 
to the buzz. And the buzz is ... well, don't expect a masterpiece, 
just a really good movie with cool special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.  
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened  
Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater 
executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star 
Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by  
the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, 
along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and 
soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, it's a movie!'' responded Tom Sherak, distribution head  
of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas. 
``It isn't the Bible! It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism. But 
it's a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh huh.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review  
anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home 
Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was 
impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it  
feels like 'Star Wars.' However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are 
going to walk away satisfied with? Well ... perhaps, but not for 
everyone,'' Epstein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and  
most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible 
underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie 
dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and 
that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was 
annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like  
Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be 
``PHENOMENAL!!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and  
thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he 
said. ``I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer  
using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow! What a film. I'm going 
to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed. ``It  
was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a 
nightmare,'' Job21 said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of  
whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing 
out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would 
suggest he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual  
tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid 
losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract 
higher fees for showing the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz -- or for that  
matter the reactions from the professional critics who see 
``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said. ``I think it doesn't  
matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent. The film is 
going to play big in those first two weeks without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that ... the Force only knows.
