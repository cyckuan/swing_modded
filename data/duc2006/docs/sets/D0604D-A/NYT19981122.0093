NOW PLAYING: TWO NEW MINUTES OF `STAR WARS'

   HOLLYWOOD _ The opening title reads: ``Every generation has a
legend. ... Every journey has a first step. ... Every saga has a
beginning.'' Then the John Williams music starts, the opening
chords so unmistakable that movie audiences burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' is back. Or more precisely, a 2-minute 10-second
trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' the
first ``Star Wars'' film since the release of ``Return of the
Jedi'' 15 years ago. The new film, written and directed by George
Lucas, opens on May 21, but the anticipation for it is
extraordinary, several distribution executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer was screened on Tuesday in 26 states on 75 screens
selected by the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox. Fans heard
about it four days earlier on the Lucasfilm Web site
(www.starwars.com), and it quickly turned into a film event that
had no precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters showing films like ``The Waterboy,'' ``The Siege'' and
``Meet Joe Black'' were crammed with people _ mostly young men _
who paid full admission just to see the trailer and left when the
movie began. The trailer was also shown after each movie ended, so
a handful of theater owners allowed filmgoers to return with their
torn ticket stub. (Historically, trailers used to be shown after
movies ended, hence the name.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations Co., which monitors the box office for theater
owners. ``We've never heard of a trailer packing people into a
theater. It's a precedent-setting event.'' He said the reaction to
the gimmick made it inevitable that the new ``Star Wars'' would
have powerful audience appeal. ``It's going to reach fever pitch
with this movie, which is unquestionably going to be one of the
biggest of 1999,'' Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak, the chairman of Fox's Domestic Film Group, said the
idea for the early-in-the-week trailer, which was released
nationally over the weekend, came from Lucas' associates. ``They
said since they have such a big fan base, why not set something up
just for the fans first and make sure it's shown to the rest of the
public very quickly?'' he said. ``The idea was to figure out a way
to have fun with this. `Star Wars' is part of the culture, but it's
still a movie. Let's treat it like a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the box office impact of the trailer _ and the
trailer alone _ were the substantial gains made on Tuesday night
over Monday at theaters showing it. At the Mann Theater in the
Westwood section of Los Angeles, near the University of California,
``The Siege'' took in $13,000 on Tuesday night; it had taken in
only $1,000 on Monday night. At the Union Square Theater 14 in
Manhattan, ``Meet Joe Black'' grossed $6,300 on Monday night, but
$10,800 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Star Wars'' is the first of three planned prequels
that will go back in time a full generation and detail the story of
Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the mysterious and sinister
Darth Vader. In the new film, Skywalker is a 9-year-old boy and
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a brash young Jedi knight.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas himself has virtually total control over the film. Not
only has he put his personal fortune into it, he is in charge of
its promotion and distribution. No decisions are made without his
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer itself shows glimpses of some of the film's stars:
Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as his mentor, Qui-Gon
Jinn; Natalie Portman as the young Queen and Jake Lloyd as the
young Anakin Skywalker. Samuel L. Jackson and Terence Stamp are
also in the cast.

   Whatever the mystique of ``Star Wars,'' the reaction to the
trailer seemed to burn up the Internet. It has been shown on the
``Star Wars'' Lucasfilm Web site, and was widely videotaped by fans
when it was shown on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer felt like five seconds,'' said Harry Knowles, who
founded the Ain't-It-Cool-News Web site
(www.aint-it-cool-news.com), which is populated by movie fans
obsessed with ``Star Wars.'' Over the Internet, Knowles seemed
stricken with guilt about his early qualms about the new ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate myself for every doubt I had,'' he said. ``What on
earth was I ever thinking? Analyzing every nugget, every whisper.
Worrying about reshoots and deadlines. George seems to be 100
percent on his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans, on the Internet, talked about weeping and shaking
while watching the trailer. On Knowles' Web site, a fan named David
Chung summed up his feelings: ``What can I say! George Lucas must
be a superior form of life!''
