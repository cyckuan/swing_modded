<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store
and Taco Bell near you.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the
long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to
the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd., which is producing the movie, has licensed
Hasbro Inc., Galoob Toys Inc. and Lego Group to make the toys.
Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging. The company, which
has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects
of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its
merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie,
industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second
``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film
merchandising attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single
biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of
The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to
``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest
single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein
estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of
toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'')
didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales
generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks,
most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars''
films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie
series.
</P>
<P>
   They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King'';
the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to
guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products. ``With `Star
Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane
Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an
industry trade association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the
film merchandising industry. As a result, Lucasfilm knows this
segment of the industry like no other film studio.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,''
Brochstein said. Lucas retained the licensing rights to products
that used the ``Star Wars'' name. ``Before that, licensing was
considered ancillary income. But now in major films, particularly
those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom''
merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public
interest for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what
they're doing,'' Brochstein said. ``They've let things out in dribs
and drabs. They make it a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed retailers to begin selling
three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of
Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L. Jackson, the actor
who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle
Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but
Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full
range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two
product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I
_ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star
Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a
``Phantom'' soundtrack in May. Video games from Nintendo and Lucas
Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and
Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins
with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans
plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters. The cans featuring
Yoda will have prizes. Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the Louisville, Ky., parent of
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk
about its promotions.
