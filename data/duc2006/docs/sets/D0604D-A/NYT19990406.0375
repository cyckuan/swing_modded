<P>
   If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like
a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie
has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc., the maker of the
popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and
eject pellet-size sweets. His company, known for its dispensers of
Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a
galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers
in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of
``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' The new dispensers show the
heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the
furry-faced Ewoks. The company already has other well-known ``Star
Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers,
Yoda and Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   More are coming.
</P>
<P>
   McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly
anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars''
collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their
Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in
Orange, Conn. ``It's a big thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style. In 1996, PEZ bigwigs
trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate
office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging
his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German
word for peppermint _ pfefferminz. ``They loved us, we loved
them,'' McWhinnie explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997
_ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored
and returned to the big screen. So they were pleasantly surprised
when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided
with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the
Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will
create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top
of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the
``Phantom'' appears. ``I can't tell you (about those) characters,''
McWhinnie said with a chuckle. ``I was at a private showing. I had
to sign my name to get in.''
