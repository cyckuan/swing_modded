BACKLASH STRIKES LUCAS' EMPIRE, BUT IT'S UNJUSTIFIED

   The ``Star Wars'' series has a lot to answer for. In the
specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as
the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking. Its success, along
with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind
of movie forever.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that
``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind.'' It
got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still
imitated today, 60 years later. ``GWTW'' producer David O. Selznick
made sure that every step of the film's conception was covered by
the all-too-willing news media: from the purchase of the rights to
Margaret Mitchell's novel to the highly publicized worldwide search
for a Scarlett O'Hara. If the cable outlet E!, which serves up
fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been
around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's
office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd
manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward
to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a
personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before
its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to
shop around to get made. Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit
``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars.'' And one of
the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was
stuck inside in the Sunday Arts &AMP; Leisure section, and detailed a
Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with
that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into
theaters on time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the
first post-Vietnam War-era movie. That is, the first big movie of
its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by
'70s cynicism or fear of the draft. (Lucas was set to direct what
became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's
not that he was unfamiliar with those elements.) The characters _
more archetype than character, really _ lent themselves to the
sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering
of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in
searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so. Luke Skywalker's
quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and
Superman's feats.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into
hyperspace. If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with
Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that
Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it
might have got the obsessives out of the house. But bringing the
trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who
were kids when they saw it the first time. And the rerelease also
served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting
appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace.'' ``Phantom''
is in the unique _ and intimidating _ position of being hyped
everywhere for its May 19 opening.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the
enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it
changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before. Before ``Star
Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on
well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and
spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from
their TVs. Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves
trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before
``Star Wars'' was made. (The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was
made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the
home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it.) Even ``Jaws''
was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on
a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach
blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience
that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson
(''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint
Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a
movie again and again. ``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and
science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation
that was running the film industry. They didn't yet realize that
science fiction was due to replace the western as the action
metaphor that mattered. The evidence, based on the middling ratings
of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage
industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't
rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen. Unless
Stanley Kubrick put them up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio
wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No. 1
grossing movie of all time from the box office. It took 35 years,
and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as
box-office champ. But it took less than three years for ``Star
Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star
Wars'' in box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the
film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a
way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a
manifest-destiny hit. They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens
of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who
had long since outlived their usefulness. (Although Eastwood did go
on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his
movies. If you need any further proof, just check the layers of
dust on top of that copy of ``Honkytonk Man'' at your local video
store.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,''
along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements,
Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling
of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action
adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit. That
is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such
as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi
documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete
with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern.
(At the time, it served as a fairly subtle indication that the
Force had fascistic implications.) Or the x-wing shootout sequence
lifted from scores of WWII dogfight scenes. In the pre-video days,
the world of old movies was mostly at the fingertips of film-school
students. People who could study them over and over, and carefully
decide what to steal _ or, more politely, pay homage to.
</P>
<P>
   By hitting so big so fast, ``Star Wars'' raised interest in
entertainment, so that now every publication except ``The
Watchtower'' sees the virtue of giving movie-related stories big
play. But the result is that the generation following every step of
``The Phantom Menace'' before it opens Wednesday is robbed of a
sense of discovery. They'll never know the thrill of going to a
late show on a Monday night and finding it's sold out. What ``Star
Wars'' helped to create, and has now become a part of, is the need
to have every element of a film spelled out before it's seen. Lucas
and company tried to sidestep spilling secrets, but the Internet is
filled with reviews by fans who sneaked into exhibitor screenings.
Almost everyone has forgotten the joy of having a hit sneak up on
you, of seeing a movie no studio wanted to make blast its way to
the top. That's why the world got sick of Quentin Tarantino so
fast.
