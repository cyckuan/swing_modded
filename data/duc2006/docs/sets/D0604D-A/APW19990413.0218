	NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``Star Wars'' mania heating up across the  
nation, retailers are gearing up for what's expected to be one of 
the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its  
1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3, the first day that 
merchants are permitted to sell goods based on ``Star Wars: Episode 
I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large  
area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer, told The  
Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of 
``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars''-related goods -- from snack foods to body lotion to  
skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments 
in Wal-Mart's stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related  
merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les 
Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top  
$2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming 
from toy sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie debuts May 19.  
</P>
<P>
	Merchants expect anxious ``Star Wars'' fans --both children and  
avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on 
May 3, hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing  
deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing 
virtually all information on their products to the general public, 
including the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose  
the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep  
the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin 
stocking store shelves late on May 2.
