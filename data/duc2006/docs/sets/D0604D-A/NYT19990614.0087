<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided,
``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas
to pack the theaters once again.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international
movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland
are claiming credit for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather
their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the
movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the
much-anticipated prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office
gross chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to
11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday,
reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters.
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the
``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana, Calif., is paying no mind to
the movie pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an
attendance dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe
in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said
Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying
to spread the word about Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   He's circulating Fan Day fliers. He's making up Fan Day badges
that participants can wear around their necks that day. He's even
tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about a phantom menace. Many of his efforts have fallen
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to
fans in line. And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that
Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on
opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan
Day arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said
taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its
Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before
the movie debuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we
made with Fox,'' said Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with
long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first
week. But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The
General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go, `It's been there long enough. We gotta show other
movies,' '' Daoudi said. ``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at
Burbank's AMC 14 theater, which is scheduled to begin showing the
film in its new digital format starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star
Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of
AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or
group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening.
And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the
fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to
do that,'' Fay said. ``But anything is possible, especially, as
I've learned, when it comes to movies.'' &UR;  &QL;
