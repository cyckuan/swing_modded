<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' To Premier at Midnight </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and  
dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was 
set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight 
screenings around the country early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,''  
said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at 
Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the 
doors swung open to get a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The 
only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to 
approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge,  
unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box 
office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in 
a very competitive release period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than  
$100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through 
Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' 
for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 
million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its  
ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all 
time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in 
tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 
million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes 
Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star  
Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. 
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The 
reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 
</P>
<P>
	The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who  
likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 
</P>
<P>
	More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who  
called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' 
movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger  
Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an 
astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the  
entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the 
back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when 
Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who 
would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so  
far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and 
video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons 
beyond recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead  
for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up  
weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, 
there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22  
years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning 
Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but  
there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' 
line.''
