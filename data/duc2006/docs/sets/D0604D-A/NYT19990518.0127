   The new ``Star Wars'' prequel is good enough, but only just.
It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination,
nor the resonance one had hoped for. What fans will want to know,
now that the hype can be replaced with actuality, is whether ``The
Phantom Menace'' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three
films to make it worth seeing. The answer is yes, but not by much.
George Lucas, perhaps inevitably drawn back into the ``Star Wars''
gravitational field, has talked a lot about technological
razzle-dazzle not being nearly as important as the characters and
story. But the truth is that it's the visuals and the new screenful
of computer-generated whiz-bangs and other toys that drive ``The
Phantom Menace.'' Character and personality take a back seat on
this ride.
</P>
<P>
   The kids toward whom the new film is frankly skewed will storm
the malls and multiplexes to see Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi as
a young hothead Jedi warrior, how Obi-Wan's wise mentor, Liam
Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, teaches him control, and how they both
discovered Jake Lloyd's prodigy, Anakin Skywalker, before he even
knew there was such a thing as The Force, much less a Dark Side of
it. R2-D2 and C-3PO (before he got the skin job that made him gold
and shiny) are on hand, too. We're also introduced to Natalie
Portman's young queen Amidala, who becomes the mother of Luke and
Leia; to Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu, whose role as a Jedi
Council mainstay is so small you know he'll be back in later
episodes; and to Ahmed Best's comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, a
rubber-limbed amphibian Gumby figure who talks funny and walks
clumsy and brightens the rather long and lightweight film a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom
Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to
think of it as soul food. Its high point isn't even the space or
land battles one has come to expect of ``Star Wars.'' It's a
chariot race right out of ``Ben-Hur,'' except that it takes place
on the desert planet of Tatooine, its chariots are jet-powered
jalopy pods, and young Anakin looks like a World War I flying ace
as he challenges the nasty champ in a contest whose ultimate winner
will be Nintendo; pod race games will fly off the shelves as fast
as laser swords.
</P>
<P>
   Great pains were taken to make the gear in ``Phantom Menace''
look less sleek and evolved than in ``Star Wars,'' a reasonable
enough decision since it takes place three decades earlier. Jabba
the Hutt, who figures briefly, even looks less blobby than the
heavyweight we meet later. Looking at Lloyd's smart, tough,
empathetic Anakin has the effect of making us dread what we know
will later be his downfall. But the fact is that there isn't much
emotional tug this time around. ``The Phantom Menace'' is bland,
perhaps not surprisingly considering the difficulty of conjuring up
the freshness and wonder with which the original burst upon the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically slicker, this installment isn't nearly as
involving as ``Star Wars'' or ``The Empire Strikes Back.'' (By the
time ``Return of the Jedi'' came out, there was a noticeable
drop-off in energy and inspiration _ a trend that continues here.)
There's no equivalent here of Alec Guinness's twinkling wisdom,
Harrison Ford's unruliness, or the looming ominousness of the grown
Darth Vader. Lucas has written better stuff here for his Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic computers than he has for the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' mutes McEwan's Obi-Wan and Neeson's
Qui-Gon to the point where we grow detached enough to speculate on
possible influences on aspects the new film. When Qui-Jon and
Obi-Wan visit Anakin's mother, learn about the remarkable
circumstances surrounding the boy's birth, and ask her permission
to take her son from slavery on Tatooine to a life as an apprentice
Jedi knight, the moment seems to echo, intentionally or not,
``Citizen Kane.'' Visually, the idyllic capital of Naboo, the
peaceful planet ruled by Amidala and coveted by the trouble-making
Dark Lord of the Sith, suggests a cross between Marin County and
the patina-domed campuses of Stanford and the University of
California at Berkeley. The elaborate sci-fi towers of the
Federation's capital city of Coruscant suggest ``Metropolis''
passed through a computer. Darth Maul, the bad guy in the climactic
laser sword fight, suggests a hooded wannabe from the rock group
KISS. Lucas even has fun with ``Monday Night Football'' in the
character of a two-headed announcer at the pod races. The big
victory celebration seems like a halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' dissolved the line
between movies and theme parks, so ``The Phantom Menace'' dissolves
the line between movies and merchandising. It's its own giant
exercise in product placement. It's hard to believe that McGregor's
Obi-Wan and Portman's Amidala won't be given juicier material in
episodes two and three. Even allowing for the inevitably
overinflated expectations connected to this overinflated event,
``The Phantom Menace'' is more fizzle than sizzle. Although it at
least avoids disaster, it brings to mind an exchange at Lucas's
recent press conference in New York. When I asked the director what
was at stake for him with this movie, personally and
professionally, he replied, ``Nothing.'' Perhaps that's the trouble
with it.
