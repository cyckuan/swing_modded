   SEATTLE _ The Force pulsates through the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the knob. Walk in. Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Look out! It's Darth Vader, 7 feet tall, leering in the foyer.
His red and green chest lights flash mean and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Dash to the bedroom. More trouble. A blaster-toting Imperial
Stormtrooper is crouched in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta escape! Where? Think. The back patio.
</P>
<P>
   Almost there.... A few more steps.... Oh no!
</P>
<P>
   Boba Fett is blocking the way _ and his laser is about to get
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Doom looms. Then, from out of the blue, a voice of salvation:
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like some of my world-famous spaghetti sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the universe _ actually the Kirkland, Wash., home _
of Lauren Bock, where a zeal for ``Star Wars'' and homemade Italian
cooking makes for out-of-this-world fun.
</P>
<P>
   Bock and his family are among the top collectors of ``Star
Wars'' memorabilia in the Pacific Northwest. He has almost every
boxed action figure connected to George Lucas' popular movie
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   All told, more than 4,000 4-inch and 12-inch ``Star Wars''
dolls, including vintage items, populate his home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with excitement building for next month's premiere of
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' it's boom time for
Bock and other collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a video crew from cable TV's Sci-Fi Channel dropped
by to tape a show due out in early May. The topic? ``Star Wars''
uber-fans.
</P>
<P>
   Bock says he has been spending $100-a-day on stuff related to
the saga _ from bar soap with a tiny R2D2 inside to his latest
find: Star Wars shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the series kicked off in the late 1970s, sales of ``Star
Wars'' toys, games, soundtracks and books have topped $4 billion,
according to Warman's Today's Collector Magazine, a leading trade
publication. And `Phantom's'' spinoff sales alone could break the
$1 billion mark, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bock has forked out tens of thousands of
dollars for his still-growing stash. The 57-year-old retired
insurance adjuster got his purchasing power after taking a big
gamble: He sold off two rental properties and put the profits,
along with part of an inheritance, into Microsoft stock in the late
'80s. ``My toy money,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-by-6-foot model of the spaceship Millennium Falcon, its gun
turrets pumping red lasers, swoops from his living room ceiling. A
television, 65 inches wide, blares ``The Empire Strikes Back''
(Bock's favorite flick). The walls of his hallways are blanketed
with signed pictures from stars of the space trilogy. Need to go to
the bathroom? Be forewarned... eyes from hundreds of creatures from
a galaxy far, far away will be on you.
</P>
<P>
   But these items are just the trailer before the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Bock's best stuff is in an upstairs bedroom and in the basement.
Both rooms are brimming with ``Star Wars'' paraphernalia: Two
pinball machines, two stand-alone arcade games and two
wood-and-glass cases chock-full of dolls, ceramic cookie jars and
Frisbee-size rubber molds used to make ``Star Wars'' commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so much fun,'' Bock gushes, his arms spread high and
wide. ``God, it's great!''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second Wednesday of April, and Bock's home is
officially Sarlacc's Pit _ named after Lucas' omnivorous,
multi-tentacled creature with sharp teeth. Pit members have
fashioned an appropriate acronym: Seattle ARea Lucasfilm Artifacts
Collectors Club.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly gathering brings together more than 40 people who
watch ``Star Wars'' videos, dress up in movie costumes and weigh
the latest flick gossip. They also clear up misinformation _ the
bane of the serious collector. But in no way, they insist, do
members ``geek out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not like Trekkies,'' says one visitor.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting, however, is particularly festive. Maybe it's
because the prequel is about a month away, or because the sun is
out or because the Sci-Fi Channel crew is giddy to have the members
circle a table and parody a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. (``Hi,
my name is Bill. I'm a Star War-holic.'')
</P>
<P>
   In any case, light sabers are swinging. One pair of excited
members, wielding toy sabers that go vhronn
