<HEADLINE> 'Phantom Menace' Hits $200M Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting  
box-office records, but it is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was North  
America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing 
in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 
days. ``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped  
``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever 
for a romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore,  
earned $21.9 million in three days last year. The comparable 
three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill  
ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between 
Ms. Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British 
bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying. It already holds  
records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to 
break the $100 million barrier (five days). 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie's like a thoroughbred. We put it on the track every  
day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution 
head for 20th Century Fox. He said families are the key to the 
repeat business if ``Phantom'' is to thrive in the summer 
blockbuster season. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's strategy to open its films before and after ``Star  
Wars'' paid off. ``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, 
was in third place last weekend with $12.7 million. It has grossed 
$117.1 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace has got to support more than one movie. There  
are different tastes,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth  
Floor,'' opened in fifth place. The sci-fi film noir had a 
disappointing $4.3 million, industry estimates showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative,  
tanked in its second week, dropping out of the top 10 list with a 
gross of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.:
