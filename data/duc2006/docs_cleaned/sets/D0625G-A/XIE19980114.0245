Out of 1,027,000 live births, 92,000 children under the age of five in Kenya die annually due malnutrition and attendant diseases, the East African Standard newspaper reported today.
And for every 1,000 births in east Africa's Uganda and Tanzania, 141 children die of the same causes, said Ratemo Michieka, Vice Chancellor of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), at an ongoing international food workshop here.
Many parts of Africa had in recent years experienced acute food shortage and serious famine, leading to major cases of malnutrition, he said.
He noted that about 200 million children under the age of five in developing countries are malnourished and incapable of fighting diseases.
The three-day workshop, with the theme of "Formulation and Implementation of Nutrition Programs," is jointly organized by JKUAT and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
More than 40 experts from Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia, Uganda, Chile, Malawi, Ethiopia, Zambia and FAO headquarters attended the meeting to which is to end tomorrow.
