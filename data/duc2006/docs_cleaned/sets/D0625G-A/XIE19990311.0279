Twenty-two people have died of starvation in Fafi area of Garissa District in Kenya's North Eastern Province in the past week, according to six members of parliament from the province.
The six MPs, accompanied by 10 councilors from Garissa District, pleaded Wednesday that the government and the donor community send emergency relief food to the areas.
Addressing a press conference at the parliament building in Nairobi, the MPs asked the government to declare the province a disaster zone.
Barre Shill, one of the six MPs, told the press that some people in the area are dying of diarrhoea and "other diseases related to lack of food and water."
They accused the Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu of misleading the government by denying that people were dying from starvation, saying there is a great famine in the province and people are dying.
Those local leaders also noted that the famine situation in the province was being aggravated by lack of medical supplies and poor communication.
