More than eighty people have died of malaria within the past two months at the Kisii General Hospital in Nyanza Province in western Kenya, newspapers reported on Saturday.
According to records at the hospital, 38 people died in January, 33 in February while 10 others in the first week of March.
Over 5,000 cases of malaria have been handled in the hospital during this period.
Anti-malaria drugs, including quinine injectables and tablets, were sent to the area last week, said acting superintendent J. O. Ogato in Kisii on Friday.
Kenyan Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri, who recently carried out an anti-malaria awareness campaign in the region, said his government is well- prepared to tackle the annual highland malaria menace that afflicts the areas at the onset of the long rains between March and June.
The government would not allow a repeat of what happened last year when the disease killed thousands of people including school children, he said.
He said that the government has stocked enough anti-malaria drugs in all health facilities in the country to manage any outbreak in the malaria prone areas.
Malaria and HIV/AIDS are the leading killer diseases in Kenya.
"The government spends a lot of money to cure 20 million Kenyans who contract malaria annually," Ongeri said.
