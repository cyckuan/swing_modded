Kenya and the World Bank today jointly launched a multi-million dollar project for the control and prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the killer disease of AIDS in the east African state.
Launching the project in Nairobi today, the Kenyan Minister for Health Joshua Angatia said the government contributed 4.5 U.S. million dollars to the project, while the World Bank provided 40.5 million U.S. dollars of financial aid.
Angatia called on international aid institutions and donors countries to make further donations to the AIDS-ridden country, saying effective AIDS prevention in the country required an estimated 14 million U.S. dollars each year.
He gave credit to the Kenyan National Aids and STI Program in their efforts to control and prevent the spread of the diseases, but emphasised a change of unhealthy habits to check their spread.
The minister also urged various NGOs related to control and prevention of AIDs to continue supplementing the government efforts in reducing the AIDS cases in the country.
