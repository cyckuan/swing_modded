Top medical experts have flown to Kenya's Northeastern Province to investigate the mysterious disease which claimed over 160 lives in the last four days, local press reported today.
Local press quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical Services, as saying Tuesday that the experts listed 12 possible diseases including yellow and Rift Valley fevers, Marburg fever and severe malaria.
The symptoms of the disease are diarrhoea, high fever and bleeding from the mouth and nose.
Mwanzia said that the disease which is said to kill people within 36 hours could be a mix of malaria and dysentery because of the flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the warm spell which followed.
He said that relevant specimens would be flown to Nairobi on daily basis for analysis.
