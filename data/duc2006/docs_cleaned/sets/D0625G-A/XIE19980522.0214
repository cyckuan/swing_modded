More than 2,000 Kenyans and 7,500 animals have been displaced by the continuing flooding caused by the rising Lake Victoria waters.
About 8,200 acres of crop have been destroyed in Nyando, southwest Kenya alone, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
The lake, which burst its banks last week for the first time in three decades, has affected the entire shoreline in Busia, Siaya, Bondo, Kisumu, Nyando, Rachuonyo, Homa bay and Suba districts.
Many families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped by the floods and drowned, entire villages and schools swept away and other houses submerged as the lake waters engulf the mainland.
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods, while lack of communication also worsens the situation.
Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western highlands.
The flooding has raised fears of disease.
Last year, water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept across the region, claiming scores of lives.
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in Kenya although the country only holds about six percent of the lake's 2,760 cubic km of water, with Tanzania taking up 49 percent and Uganda 45 percent.
The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes which some experts argue are a result of siltation due to the blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
Among other explanations from experts are the shrinking shoreline which has not been surveyed for more than 50 years and the heavy El Nino rains.
The Kenyan government has been asked to investigate a claim that a blocked outlet near the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, Uganda could have caused the sudden rise in the levels of the lake water.
