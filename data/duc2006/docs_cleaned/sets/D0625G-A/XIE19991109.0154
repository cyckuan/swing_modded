Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has said that 14 out of 100 Kenyans are infected by HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.
Kenya's productive age group is in danger of being wiped out by the disease, Saitoti said Monday at the opening of a workshop on advocacy and communication on HIV/AIDS in Eldoret, a city in west Kenya.
Saitoti told the participants that nearly 500 Kenyans die of AIDS everyday, making it the biggest killer of Kenyans in the productive age group of 15 to 49.
Media reports Tuesday quoted the vice-president as saying that 18 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 are infected by the virus every year.
Saitoti urged teachers, parents and church leaders to inform the youth on the dangers of the disease.
Research by the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control indicates that more than 1.9 million adults and 100,000 children in Kenya are infected with HIV/AIDS.
He also noted that there are more than 700,000 children orphaned by AIDS in the country, saying "this figure could reach 1.5 million by 2005 given the current trends of AIDS-related death."
The vice-president said there is also a rise in mother-child transmission of HIV in Kenya, with 30 to 40 percent of the children born to the mothers with HIV being infected with the AIDS virus during breast feeding.
