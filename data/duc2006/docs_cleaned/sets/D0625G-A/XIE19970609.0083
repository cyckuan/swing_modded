Heart ailments have increased sharply in Kenya where estimatedly some 1.2 million people, five percent of the Kenya population are at risk, according to the latest statistics issued in Nairobi.
High on the list in the eastern African country are wealthy professionals who have adopted western lifestyles, the "East African" weekly newspaper reported today.
Statistics from Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's largest referral hospital, showed a 36-percent hike of in-patients with cardiac diseases between 1992 and 1996.
Heart failure alone accounted for a 47-percent rise from 279 in 1992 to 527 last year, said the report.
New bookings for treatment at the out-patient cardiology clinic total 1,541 for June to September this year.
There has also been a marked increase in public appeals to assist Kenyans in seeking specialist surgery abroad, notably the United States, Britain, India and South Africa.
There are three principal types of heart problems in Kenya, coronary artery disease which tends to afflict better-off people, rheumatic heart disease found mainly among the poor, and congenital conditions among children, such as a hole in the heart.
Kenya now has some 20 cardiologists for adult patients, fewer than 10 specializing in children and five heart surgeons, against one in the 1970s.
