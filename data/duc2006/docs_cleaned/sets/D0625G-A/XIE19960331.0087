Cases of heart attacks in Kenya have increased by almost tenfold in last 30 years, a Kenya cardiologist, Dr Daniel Gikonyo has said.
Dr Gikonyo, who did not disclosed the specific number of cases of heart attacks, said that the rising incidences of coronary artery diseases among Africans over the years have been noted and are a cause of growing concern.
Dr Gikonyo was speaking on Friday evening during the launch of a coronary heart disease (CHD) drug, Lescol, developed by Sandoz Pharma.
The drug was launched first in 1994 in the United States.
He blamed smoking, lack of exercises, excess body weight, psychological stress among other factors as the main contributors to the rising figures.
He said some of the risk factors are preventable.
Reports said road accidents, HIV infection which causes the killer disease of Aids account for the largest number of deaths in Africa.
