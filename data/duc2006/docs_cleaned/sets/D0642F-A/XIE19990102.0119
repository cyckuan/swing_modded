Venezuela's foreign exchange reserves closed the year 1998 at 14.85 billion U.S. dollars, down 16.64 percent compared with 1997, the Central Bank of Venezuela said Friday.
The bank attributed the drop to foreign debt payments and central bank policies to defend the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, as well as speculative attacks on markets, electoral expectations and the adverse scenario created by the falling oil prices.
However, the bank said the existing foreign reserves would be enough to cover imports for at least 11 months.
The bolivar faced great pressure last August and September, but strong intervention by the central bank on the exchange market and an increase in interest rates helped curb market speculation.
The value of the Venezuelan currency recovered after the landslide victory of Hugo Chavez in the presidential elections on December 6.
It afterwards underwent moderate depreciation.
