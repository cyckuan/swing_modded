Elections of Venezuela's Constitutional Assembly ended Sunday with President Hugo Chavez's supporters winning 123 out of the 131 seats.
His supporters garnered 96 percent of the votes, Chavez announced after the election results came out.
Describing the elections as a most important chapter in Venezuela's history, Chavez said the Constitutional Assembly could dissolve Congress and the Supreme Court while he would recommend that the Constitutional Assembly change the country's official name to "the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela."
Besides amending the 1961 Constitution, the Constitutional Assembly will carry out a series of reforms including installing a premier post and reshuffling the government, Chavez said.
Determined to rebuild impoverished Venezuela through a series of political and social reforms, Chavez has campaigned hard for a Constitutional Assembly with broader power.
