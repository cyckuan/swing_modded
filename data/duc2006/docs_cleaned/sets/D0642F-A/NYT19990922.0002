In an effort to reassure foreign investors, Venezuela's president said Tuesday that his government would make all its debt payments while at the same time work on a market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current debt over a longer period of time.
``We will continue to service our foreign debt, but we want to reduce the profile,'' President Hugo Chavez said through a translator at a New York news conference, held in part to give him a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies.
His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging markets in Latin America.
Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from the devaluation of its currency in January.
Venezuela's news conference was organized by J.P. Morgan Securities, which is offering the government ideas on ways to rework its debt.
As the session began, Susana de la Puente, managing director for Latin American investment banking at J.P. Morgan Securities, noted that there had been ``a lot of bad press about Venezuela lately.''
Neither Chavez nor his finance minister, Jose Rojas, would give any details of what kind of debt reworking they were thinking of.
But Ms. de la Puente said that if any proposal was made to revamp Venezuela's $21.1 billion in foreign debt, it would be ``market driven,'' adding that there would be no ``involuntary restructuring.''
She said it was possible to approach investors with a deal allowing Venezuela to swap current debt for new bonds.
``We are waiting for the right opportunity, a good opportunity to do it,'' Chavez said.
Investor concern about the political and economic future of Venezuela has left its debt prices at levels just above those for Ecuador and Russia.
The Russians have effectively defaulted, and Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that would avoid a Brady bond default.
Brady bonds, which are named for Nicholas F. Brady, a former treasury secretary, were designed as a way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in the early 1980s.
The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds.
30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $96 million in interest and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday, right in the middle of the International Monetary Fund's semiannual meeting.
Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current Brady bonds, although there have been reports that future oil revenue may be used as collateral.
Emerging-market analysts do not think debt restructuring will be easy for Ecuador.
And some say it will not be able to meet the requirements of an IMF economic program, which is a prerequisite for more international aid.
