Chavez, with his mixture of democracy and demagoguery, raises crucial questions not only about the future of oil-rich Venezuela but about other corrupt and mismanaged countries in Latin America and the rest of the world.
Appealing to patriotism, religious symbols, and revolutionary rhetoric, Chavez persuaded 72 percent of voters to approve his new constitution.
Venezuelans assented to the radical revision of institutions Chavez calls a ``peaceful revolution'' because they were disgusted with the old order.
Despite their country's oil wealth, four-fifths of Venezuelans are living in poverty.
Their political parties and courts had become notoriously corrupt.
The combination of poverty, egregious inequality, and a blatantly rigged system prepared the way for Chavez and his promises to sweep away all the old rotten structures.
Now, with their new constitution, Venezuelans have voted for the possibility of an elected dictatorship.
Chavez himself will be able to run for two six-year terms.
The army will be released from civilian control and will become a base of political power, the equivalent of a ruling party.
Hundreds of new judges and new court officers will be appointed.
The old Senate will be eliminated.
The crucial test for this new order will not be political, however, but economic.
In the year since Chavez took office, there has been a massive flight of capital from Venezuela nearly $4 billion.
This represents a telling vote of no confidence in the statist economic programs Chavez has tried to pursue with funds from rising oil prices.
Chavez may be able to charm voters with his invocations of Simon Bolivar, but markets cannot be charmed by anything other than sound fiscal and monetary policies.
Sooner or later, Chavez will have to do what it takes to reverse the flight of capital.
In the meantime, democracy is the loser.
