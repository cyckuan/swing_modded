Venezuela's President-elect Hugo Chavez said on Monday that his upcoming visit to Brazil, Argentina and Colombia aims to boost Latin American unity.
"Venezuela must play an important role in the Mercosur, the Andean community, the Caribbean, and Central America," Chavez said.
Chavez will start his three-nation tour on Tuesday.
He will first visit Brazil where he is expected to meet with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso at a private lunch in the palace of Alvorada.
Chavez is also scheduled to meet with Brazilian Foreign Affairs Minister Sebastiao Do Rego Barros, and give a news conference after the meeting.
Diplomats said Chavez will brief the Cardoso government on his foreign policy for the next five years and explain his economic and trade plans to local businessmen.
On Wednesday, Chavez will travel to Argentina.
He will end his three-nation trip with a visit to Colombia on Thursday.
