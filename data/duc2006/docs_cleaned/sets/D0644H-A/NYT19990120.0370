Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the U.S. economy and it was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions from ``political forces,'' raising the prospect that specific investment decisions could be influenced by non-financial considerations.
In his testimony, Greenspan also: Opposed any major tax cuts, a cherished goal of congressional Republicans.
Called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling.''
Warned that current high stock prices were unsustainable.
In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton proposed investing 62 percent of the projected $4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years in the stock market.
Any revenues from the investments would be used for Social Security.
Workers would be able to set up individual retirement accounts with government funds.
Investors would have a choice of investing in a handful of stock and bond funds along with adding their own money to such accounts.
Individual retirement accounts, or IRA's, allow people to save money for retirement while receiving special tax treatment.
Unless the current Social Security system is changed it will run out of money in about 2030 when the number of retirees is projected to be greater than the working population.
Social Security recipients receive money from current workers, a system that functions as long as there are more workers than retirees.
Greenspan said he supports using federal budget surpluses to strengthen Social Security, but suggested that the market for government securities is a more secure place to invest public funds because the government guarantees payment on its securities.
Historically, government securities have been less risky but slower growing.
He also voiced a philosophical objection to pouring federal money into the stock market, arguing such a move could hurt the economy by interfering with private market forces in deciding which companies to fund.
The Federal Reserve chairman agreed that the Social Security System needed to be repaired but he offered few suggestions on how to do so.
Greenspan chaired a federal task force in the early 1980s that recommended a series of changes to Social Security, which helped keep the system from going broke at the time.
While the Social Security issue is expected to receive more attention in Congress this year, Republicans are also eying the budget surplus for tax cuts.
This, for example, would lower the 28 percent tax bracket to 25.2 percent.
``At this particular stage with the economy doing well...we don't need a tax cut,'' Greenspan said.
He said the best medicine to ensure the long-term health of the economy is to use the budget surplus to pay off a portion of the $5 trillion debt.
But, he said, if Congress can't keep its hands off the surplus, the money should be used for tax cuts rather than new spending programs.
Greenspan called the U.S. economy's performance ``sparkling'' and said he has yet to see signs of any economic slow-down.
In fact, Greenspan said, ``some moderation'' in the economy might be needed to bring the economy back to a point where it doesn't threaten to spark inflation, or a rise in prices.
Corporate profits help determine individual stock prices.
Greenspan said he doubted that the market could maintain its current high level.
Wall Street generally reacted positively to Greenspan as he signaled that the Federal Reserve wasn't likely to change interest rates any time soon.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 75 points after Greenspan's remarks but ultimately closed down 19.31 points to 9,335.91.
The Standard Poor's 500 rose 4.61 to 1,256.61, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.32 to 2,415.49.
