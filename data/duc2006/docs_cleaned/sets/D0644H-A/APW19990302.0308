The United States is on the threshold of a truly remarkable turnaround in financial fortunes: the tantalizing prospect that the booming economy could make the federal government debt-free in just 15 years.
And it could happen, for only the second time in the nation's history, with seemingly no heavy lifting.
If politicians simply leave current policies alone, the president's Office of Management and Budget projects the $3.7 trillion debt held by the public will be wiped out in 2014.
The Congressional Budget Office is even more optimistic, predicting publicly held debt could be gone by 2012.
With politicians eager for tax cuts and more spending, no one expects lawmakers actually to leave well enough alone.
``Congress over the long haul abhors surpluses.
They will be dispensed in some fashion, either as tax cuts or increased spending,'' predicts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution.
Skeptics note that leaves the other third of the $4.5 trillion in projected future surpluses for spending increases or tax cuts.
And that means both parties are, in essence, already running behind the debt paydown schedule that would occur if there are no changes in policy.
In 2014, the year the OMB projects that debt held by the public could be eliminated with no changes in policy, Clinton's budget instead sees a publicly held debt of $1.17 trillion.
The situation is even worse if the total national debt is considered.
After five years, the national debt under Clinton's plan, including the extra IOUs for Social Security, will grow to $6.8 trillion, compared to $5.9 trillion under the OMB forecast with no policy changes.
The administration defends the extra IOUs as a way to lock in, for Social Security, benefits of paying down the public debt.
Private economists generally are neutral, arguing that because the trust funds exist only as bookkeeping entries, it's the debt held by the public that actually matters for the economy.
On that point, economists generally give the administration high marks for using the bulk of the surpluses to pay down the public debt, and thus put the government on a sounder footing to meet future retirement demands of 73 million baby boomers.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told Congress the best use for surpluses would be shrinking the national debt, thus freeing money for investment by private businesses.
``By wiping out the debt held by the public, we increase national savings, keep interest rates low, build our capital stock and fuel long-term growth,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national economic adviser.
The Clinton administration also stresses that reducing the public debt will trim the government's interest bill.
Interest payments accounted for 15 cents of every budget dollar in 1997.
In all, they totaled $243 billion, which bought not a single battleship nor paper clip.
Interest payments this year will amount to 11 percent of the budget.
Clinton projects they will drop to 2 percent in 2014 before disappearing in 2018, the year he says the public debt will disappear.
The CBO forecasts public debt gone by 2012.
But it also notes that era will be short-lived as escalating payments to retirees put the nation back in debt by 2040.
Of course, all long-range forecasts need to be taken with a grain of salt.
``Right now, with a good economy, we have had unrelentingly good news, but that could change quickly,'' former CBO director Robert Reischauer said.
And the experience of President Andrew Jackson, the only president to eliminate the debt, should also serve as a cautionary tale.
In his 1832 campaign for the White House, Jackson called the debt a ``national curse'' and in 1835 fulfilled his pledge to wipe it out, creating a surplus of $440,000.
But even before he left office, the debt was rising again as the country entered a six-year recession.
``Paying off the national debt doesn't automatically mean economic good times,'' historian John Steele Gordon said.
``After Jackson did it, the country went into the longest recession in its history.''
