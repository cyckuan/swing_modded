Your welfare checks and the monthly rations of government commodities barely kept the wolf from the door.
Unemployment ran as high as 80 percent, and the average life span was 47 years.
The automobile used for transporting your family to the hospital or grocery store was held together with baling wire.
This is the way it was in Indian country a short 12 years ago before the casinos came.
But today, on some reservations an explosion of sudden riches has been nearly overwhelming.
The jump from extreme poverty to extreme wealth happened so quickly it was as if every member of the tribe hit the million-dollar lottery.
That is what the advent of gaming in Indian country has created, an unparalleled phenomenon that astonishes, excites and frightens many.
In other more isolated reservations, poverty still grips the community and little has changed.
For those tribal leaders caught by the unprecedented overnight leap from rags to riches, the endeavor to adjust rapidly became one of trial and error.
And some tribes, in their haste to get on the gaming bandwagon, threw all caution to the wind and brought in casino management companies of dubious reputation.
Others signed compacts with state governments that nearly shredded their status as sovereign nations.
Many tribal leaders made mistakes.
That is what happens when people accustomed to living in poverty are suddenly thrust into wealth.
Every snake oil salesman in the country with a get-rich-quick scheme suddenly converged upon tribes long treated as `out of sight, out of mind.'
So it was that tribes' education to the world of high finance had begun.
In the past I have been critical of some of the better-off tribes a few of them signing legal documents with state governments that would eventually impact all of the Indian Nations.
My mistake was not allowing them to learn and to grow using their errors as educational tools.
This month an 84-room hotel will be opened by the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe on the North Dakota-South Dakota border.
This is the first phase of a $10.8 million plan that will feature a new casino and resort.
Another new casino twice as large as the current one will open in the fall.
The tribe hopes to have an RV (recreational vehicle) park open by midsummer.
The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Tribe of Minnesota, who owns the extremely successful Mystic Lake Casino at Shakopee, and whom I have also criticized, financed this entire project.
Meanwhile, the Mashentucket Pequot, owners of the richest Indian casino the Foxwood Casino at Ledyard, Conn. has begun to hire Indian people from all over America to management positions.
Thus, they are now using their prosperity, as are the Shakopee Mdewakanton, to reach out to other tribes less fortunate than themselves.
Gaming has brought about extraordinary success and extraordinary doubts and fears to Indian country.
As a result, understandably, there are those Nations that have chosen not to have gambling.
Conditions of extreme poverty exist today on those Indian lands where gaming has not been embraced.
The Hopi (Arizona) and Navajo Nation (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah) are two good examples.
Neither tribe has looked to gaming for their salvation.
The Navajo voted against gaming in a reservation-wide referendum about two years ago.
The Hopi, who are very traditional and spiritual in their beliefs and lifestyle, voted in a special election in 1994 not to open a casino.
Hopi Chief of Staff Eugene Kaye said simply, ``The people decided they didn't want gaming so they just voted it down.''
Twice, the issue has been on the ballot of the Navajo Nation and twice, it has gone down to defeat.
Former Chairman Albert Hale said, ``When an issue as important as gaming comes up, we cannot afford to leave it in the hands of the politicians because many of them would look at it as a revenue producer and probably favor it.
We left it up to the Navajo people and they said no.''
The Navajo and Hopi are politically astute.
They have observed the good and the bad of Indian casinos on other reservations and they fear a casino would interfere with their cultural and traditional way of life.
For the most part, the Hopi and Navajo still speak in their native languages.
They see more evil in gaming than good.
They are fierce protectors of their sovereignty and they have watched other tribes diminish their own sovereignty in order to gain wealth.
Both tribes maintain very rigid social management units within their matrilineal clans.
This tightly knit management process ensures continuity and gives the tribe as a whole a means for survival even when facing destructive natural elements or the extreme pressures exerted upon them from the encroachment of modern society.
It is this concept of a communal, sacred responsibility that has allowed these people to look sudden wealth in the face and turn their backs to it.
Anyone who visits Chinle, Window Rock, or Tuba City on the Navajo Nation or Shongopavi, Shipaulovi or Oraibi on the Hopi Nation, will not fail to observe the quiet dignity the people carry in their poverty.
Thus far, even though they are the poorest of the poor, the Navajo and Hopi have not succumbed to the temptations offered by that green god called money.
Dignity is something money cannot buy.
