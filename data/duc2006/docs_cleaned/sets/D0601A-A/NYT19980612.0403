Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers to stop asking how she spends that money.
Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because there's only enough money for one meal a day.
Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear apart a computer and put it back together.
It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult and indifference.
It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from welfare to work.
White Mountain Apache community's welfare program started in April.
Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996 federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of many state programs.
And most are in need of more money.
The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're training their own.
By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce, welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for their elders in exchange for their benefits.
``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo, a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis' program and the state-run program.
``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes.''
Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S. Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D.
Hayworth and Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state capital.
Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest families.
``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now receiving benefits to work.
``They're not numbers to us, they're people.
They're families.''
But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown, Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest reservations.
Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits.
That limit is pressuring states to move quickly with reform.
Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown.
Expensive problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to pay for solving those complicated problems.
The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program, are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to prepare for work, some are older with more children and less education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have waiting lists.
There is little money and staff to help find families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems families Garcia is unwilling to let go.
As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and distribute cash benefits for their members.
The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of cash benefits.
It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working with three different federal regional offices.
While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a little more than two years.
The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on welfare.
While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe.
This tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina.
He said, `Just go like you are.'
Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to interview for the program.
``I've just been having kids and staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn anything.''
Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid to touch.
But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day.
She renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with conversations about computers.
``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class.
My mom's building computers.'
