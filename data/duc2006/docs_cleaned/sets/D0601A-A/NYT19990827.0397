tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern Nebraska found itself Friday at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins.
The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation.
Friday that little casino nearly led a U.S. District Court judge in Omaha, Neb., to take an unprecedented step: the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling.
Although the judge, William Cambridge, ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory.
Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3 1/2 years ago.
The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino.
There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes.
But Nebraska, opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding Friday.
That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation.
The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas.
The tribes' position was supported by Gov.
