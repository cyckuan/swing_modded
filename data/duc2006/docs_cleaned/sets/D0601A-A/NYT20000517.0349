_ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either.
Instead, the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first week of May.
This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in school.
It was not entirely successful.
In the math class taught by Chessmore, for example, only five of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April.
Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools, many of those in Indian country stand out.
Last year, the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th percentile.
Fewer than half the students in grades three through 12 came to take the test, Chessmore said.
And while this year's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country.
On average, 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group.
Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college, and most do not finish.
``We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native American Scholarship Fund.
``Whatever test you're looking at, Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile.
The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent.
Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 no geometry, no trig and people wonder why they're failing out of college.''
Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.
The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos.
But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
Some reservation schools have done well and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago.
But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation.
These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life.
What happens to them?
All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know.''
To some degree, state and federal officials are responding.
President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs $1.2 billion which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers.
Currently, most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are extremely high, and many believe the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles.
And in August, a task force Clinton created will present plans to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90 percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
``What's important is that what the government is doing says it's OK to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund.
``Before the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person.
Now there's a recognition that the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students.''
Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.
``We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children,'' Beaulieu said.
``In the 1990s we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before.''
The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they cannot raise the required amount from property taxes.
The bill was vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.
