By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning, Hancock County is almost deserted.
But almost anyone who works has left the county hours before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock.
The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown.
Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers and say no thanks.
Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation.
Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month.
But only 80 miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7 percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is a third less than the rest of the state.

Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.

For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else.
``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending almost all his time on the casino project.
``Think about what all those tourists could do for us.
We'd have the money to restore all those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts in town and maybe do historical re-enactments.
It would give our people a chance to become independent.''
The casino is a long way from becoming a reality.
Among other hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact for a reservation, and Gov.
