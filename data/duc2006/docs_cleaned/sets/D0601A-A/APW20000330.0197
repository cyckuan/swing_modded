Seeking to get a more accurate count of the country's American Indian population, the Census Bureau is turning to tribal leaders and residents on reservations to help overcome long-standing feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal government.
The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say, but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American Indian population.
The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent.
For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in eight Navajos were not counted in 1990.
The tribe is determined not to let that happen again.
''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie, spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians governmental affairs director Jack Jackson, Jr. is that an estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were missed.
Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said.
The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos today.
Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal governments five years ago, said Tom Beavers, partnership specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own communities to work in their own communities, and we have told Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an American Indian, who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and Minnesota.
Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs, grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family violence prevention and services.
Not everything has gone smoothly though.
Earlier this month, leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business on the reservation.
The order has since been rescinded.
Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn., complain that at times, there is too much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census officials.
Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
''This census is much better,'' Boyd said.
''Last time, the count was way off.''
