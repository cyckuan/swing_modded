The United States believed that senior Iraqi scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed last week, administration and intelligence officials said on Monday.
The evidence the administration has cited as justification for the attack consisted of a soil sample secretly obtained months ago outside the pharmaceutical factory, the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, the officials said.
Officially the administration has refused to describe its evidence in any detail, or to say how it was obtained.
The sample contained a rare chemical that would require two more complex steps to be turned into VX, one of the deadliest nerve agents in existence, and the chemical, whose acronym is EMPTA, has no industrial uses.
The United Nations and the United States have long agreed that Iraq is extremely skilled at many kinds of VX production, having worked for years to perfect the best process.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said there was evidence that senior Iraqi scientists had aided the efforts to make VX at that factory, and at another plant a couple of miles away.
The connection with Iraq emerged as a key part of the administration's argument for why it was justified in launching cruise missiles at a plant in another country without any warning.
The officials disclosed the information, four days after the American strike, to try to counter claims by the Sudanese government that the factory, located in an industrial area of Khartoum, was purely a benign commercial venture that produced half of the Sudan's medicines.
The United States, however, rebuffed calls from the Sudan and other countries to turn over its evidence.
At the United Nations, the Security Council on Monday put off a request by Arab nations submitted by one of the United States' closest Arab allies, Kuwait to send inspectors to search the rubble in Khartoum for signs of chemicals related to VX.
``We have credible information that fully justifies the strike we made on that one facility in Khartoum.''
At a news conference in Khartoum, the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan el-Bashir, kept up his sharp attacks on the United States and President Clinton, saying Clinton ordered the attack to cover up the furor over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Clinton and his senior aides have described the evidence linking the factory to the production of VX as compelling and even irrefutable, though until Monday the administration refused to discuss the evidence in any but the most general way.
The officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the soil sample, collected outside the factory, contained traces of a ``precursor chemical`` called ethyl methylphosphonothionate, or EMPTA.
There would be no viable explanation for the presence of that chemical, they said, other than the production of VX.
``You don't obtain this chemical because you're making ball point pens or whatever,'' an administration official said.
``If you're making this, you're making VX.''
There are a number of ways to make the agent, but the officials in Washington and other American and foreign officials said the technique using EMPTA is one Iraq used to develop its own VX stockpiles in the 1980s.
Officials in Washington and at the United Nations said there were a number of other factors linking Iraq to the pharmaceutical plant, as well as a second facility.
Earlier this year, President Saddam Hussein's government asked the committee that monitors U.N. sanctions to allow it to buy medicines from the factory under the ``oil for food'' program that allows humanitarian supplies into Iraq.
Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative to the United Nations who is this month's president of the sanctions committee, confirmed the request, but the officials said it was not clear what medicines were ordered or whether any were ever delivered.
Although the United Nations closely monitors goods purchased under the ``oil for food'' program, the officials said the contract could have provided a pretext for extensive visits by Iraqi officials.
The official said a number of Iraqi scientists working for Emad al-Ani had attended the grand opening of the factory two years ago.
Although the United States struck at the Shifa plant, officials in Washington acknowledged that the second plant is also suspected of making chemical weapons.
That site, according to diplomats in New York and the Sudan, has been frequently visited by Iraqi technicians and was more heavily guarded than Shifa Pharmaceutical.
However, it also in a residential neighborhood, and officials familiar with planning for the American cruise missile strikes said the fear of collateral damage was a factor in choosing a target.
