Scientists found no traces of chemical weapons compounds in a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant, which was destroyed in August by U.S. cruise missiles, the New Times said on Tuesday.
Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was attacked by the United States, alleging that its CIA intelligents had clandestinely collected soil samples from the plant site to find that these samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
The attack was conducted on August 20 after two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were devastated by terrorist bombs.
And Washington decided Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was behind the bombing and the Sudanese plant was used by bin Laden to produce chemical weapons compounds.
The plant owner, Salih Idris, flatly rejected U.S. allegations and asked scientists to examine soil, sludge and debris from the plant in a preparation to sue the United States.
The sampling project was designed and supervised by Professor Thomas D. Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department as Boston University.
Tullius said the point of what the scientists did was to "carefully and scientifically collect samples from variety of locations and have them analyzed by one of the top laboratories in the world for this kind of work."
"What they found was that in those samples, to the practical limits of scientific detection, there was no Empta or Empa, its breakdown product," the professor said.
But U.S. administration officials dismissed the findings, noting that their soil samples were taken long after the United States obtained its soil from the site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence.
Some other officials said they have strong evidence linking the plant owner to bin Laden.
