Virtually the same compound that was found outside a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and led to last week's US rocket strike was also found in the blood of a man who had been killed by VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult, a team of scientists reported here Tuesday.
Speaking at a meeting of the American Chemical Society, chemist Anthony Tu said that the compound, called EMPTA, is ``unique for VX,'' the deadliest nerve gas known, and has no other chemical function.
It exists only as an ingredient for the manufacture of VX, or as a product of its breakdown after use, he said.
Tu, a specialist in chemical weapons who teaches at Colorado State University and was one of the specialists called in by Japanese officials in the aftermath of a deadly attack by sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in 1995, said that VX had been used by the same cult group in an attack on a 28-year-old man in December 1994.
In that attack, the deadly compound was sprayed directly on the victim's skin.
The man lost consciousness immediately and died 10 days later, although the cause of his death was not determined at the time.
It was a year later, after members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had confessed to the subway attack and also to the separate VX attack, that scientists analyzed a blood sample that had been taken from the VX victim.
After all that time, the distinctive EMPTA was still clearly evident in the blood sample, said Dr. Hitoshi Tsuchihashi of the Osaka Police Institute Forensic Science Laboratory.
Tsuchihashi said no research had been published in the scientific literature about the metabolism of VX and its breakdown products, so the discovery of EMPTA in the man's blood could lead to a diagnostic test to determine if the agent was used used in any future attacks.
The victim of that 1994 attack is the only person ever known to have died from VX poisoning, Tsuchihashi said.
Tsuchihashi and his colleagues have also studied the break-down products of sarin gas and other forms of nerve gas that might be used by terrorists.
Tu said that a team of American specialists was sent to Japan shortly after the subway attack in 1995, but Japanese officials were not willing to share detailed information with them and the group ``came back empty-handed.''
That's why, he said, he decided to organize a session at this year's chemical society meeting to share the lessons learned from that attack with American scientists and emergency officials.
All of the key forensic scientists, biochemists and doctors who participated in the treatment of the victims of the sarin attack had been invited to participate, he said.
At least 12 deaths were attributed to the sarin attack.
Those deaths could have been prevented, said Dr. Tetsu Okumura of the department of acute medicine at Japan's Kawasaki Medical School, if the information had been available for a proper medical response.
Okumura, who was one of the doctors in the emergency room at St. Luke's hospital in Tokyo, where many of the victims were treated, said emergency medical personnel in his country are not allowed to perform intubations a treatment to open blocked airways at the scene of an emergency.
Such treatment would have ensured the survival of all the sarin victims, he said, adding that nerve gases cause paralysis, and those who received the largest doses of sarin were unable to breathe.
Although sarin ``victims, adequately intubated, never die,'' he said, ``in present Japanese law, EMTs cannot save the victim.
But in the US, many paramedics can do intubation at the site.''
The other treatment given in the sarin poisoning was a compound called PAM, which is also used to treat some pesticide poisonings.
As a result, in Japan the compound is routinely stocked in rural hospitals where pesticide poisonings are more common, but not in urban hospitals.
That policy needs to be re-examined in light of recent terrorist activity, he said.
The sarin victims were also treated with atropine, which is routinely stocked in hospitals, Okumura said.
But even that was not available in sufficient quantity to deal with the massive subway attack, which affected more than 5,000 people.
Only the most severely affected patients received atropine, but many others might have been spared long-term symptoms if the treatment had been available.
Dr. Tsuchihashi said a large-scale study is being carried out to monitor survivors of the subway attack, to learn what long-term effects their exposure to the gas may produce.
