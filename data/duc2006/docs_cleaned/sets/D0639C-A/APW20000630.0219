High-ranking officials were not immediately notified and alarms were ignored during a tiny leak of dangerous nerve gas at the Army's chemical-weapons incinerator in May, according to a report by the plant's operators.
The report from Army contractor EGG Defense Materials Inc. blamed the leak in Tooele, Utah, on a chain of events that began when debris jammed the feed chute of a rocket kiln.
The report said an inexperienced operator flushed the kiln with too much air, pushing unburned nerve gas out an emissions stack.
The report also said a supervisor was preoccupied with administrative work, higher officials were uninformed about the leak and warnings were ignored because of a history of false alarms.
