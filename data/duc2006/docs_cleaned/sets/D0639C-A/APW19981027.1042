Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein, said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.
The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the statement read on state-run television said.
Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with the initial tests in April that the Iraqis had used the VX for warheads.
Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program, reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon.
Saadi said the conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts scientific fact and is ``full of disgraceful scientific fallacies.''
Saadi said Iraq never tampered with the warheads.
Any attempt would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad who keep the warhead fragments under camera surveillance, he said.
