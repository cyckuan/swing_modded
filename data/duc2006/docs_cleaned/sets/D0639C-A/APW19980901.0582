The Dutch government banned a shipment of chemicals to Sudan earlier this year because of fears they might be used to make nerve gas, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
The shipment involved so-called ``dual-use'' chemicals which have both a civilian and military application, said Economic Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Paula de Jonge.
Although the Dutch exporter wanted to sell the chemicals as raw materials for use in the manufacture of fertilizer, the ministry ``had indications that it might be used for other ends,'' De Jonge said.
De Jonge would not say which chemicals were named on an April export application or where in Sudan they were headed.
She also declined to say how the Dutch government decided there was a risk the chemicals would be used for military ends.
On Aug. 20, the United States launched a cruise missile attack that destroyed a Sudanese factory, which the U.S. government claimed was making precursors for VX nerve gas.
The Sudanese government insists the El Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. plant manufactured only drugs.
