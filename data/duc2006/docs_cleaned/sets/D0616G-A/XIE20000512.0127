Three people were killed and 18 others injured in a bus explosion near the Chechen village of Dzhaglarbi on Friday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
The blast occurred at 9:35 a.m. Moscow time (0535 GMT) when an apparently radio-controlled land mine went off on the bus full of passengers, Tass quoted a Russian government representative in Chechnya as saying.
The wounded have been sent to local hospitals while the bodies of the dead have been taken to the village of Kurchalloi.
The official said rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya planned such blasts against armored personnel carriers of federal troops.
Also on Friday, assailants bombed a federal police car, wounding two officers sent to Chechnya from Kirov.
The Russian military said two men who bombed a Gudermes-Kadi- Yurt train and four people suspected of killing police officers in the Shelkovskaya district earlier in May have been caught.
Meanwhile, it warned of more possible terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels, saying that the rebels have changed their tactics and are planning a series of bombing operations in the republic.
