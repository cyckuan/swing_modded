Russia is determined to liberate the entire breakaway republic of Chechnya and to restore normal life of the Chechen civilians, said Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Wednesday.
"The liberation of Chechnya is the goal set for the federal armed forces.
President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya," Sergeyev said in Fergana, Uzbekistan.
According to the Interfax news agency, Sergeyev arrived in Uzbekistan Wednesday to analyze the performance of the Southern Commonwealth Shield-99 exercise, aimed at fighting large terrorist units with Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek forces involved.
Sergeyev said that the Russian Eastern Army has surrounded Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, and there are very few militants remaining.
He believes that local volunteers will make the greatest contribution to the liberation of Gudermes.
Naurskaya, Shelkovskaya and Nadterechnaya districts are completely controlled by the federal troops, who have also taken control of seven of the 22 villages in the Gudermes district and nine of the 31 villages in the Grozny district, while the separatists are short of weaponry, munitions and medical supplies.
Sergeyev said the federal troops will soon surround the populated areas where the rebels congregate.
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the federal troops, said a source from the Russian Defense Ministry.
The source said foreign extremists and weaponry are arriving from abroad to aid the Chechen militants, with more than 300 terrorists coming from the Middle East in October, and by orders of field commander Shamil Basayev and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
They have moved to the villages in the Itum-Kale, Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts.
