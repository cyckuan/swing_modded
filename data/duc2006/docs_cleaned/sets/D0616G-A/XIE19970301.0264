Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist attacks.
Kulikov told Interfax news agency that the interior ministry had put important targets under heavy guard in light of statements from the rebel commanders that they would continue the war against Moscow.
He said the eastern border would be closed to bandits but the ministry would not send more troops to reinforce the region.
Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets.
They said they would launch terrorist activities, involving 5,000 people, against Russia until Moscow recognized the independence of Chechnya.
The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
Newly elected President of Chechnya, Aslan Maskhadov, ordered that kidnappers be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals.
