She woke up perspiring, trying desperately to catch her breath.
She ran to the bathroom with diarrhea and surges of nausea.
For three hours, she suffered, certain she would never see morning.
The morning of her grandmother's funeral.
But she wasn't.
Cvijanovic later learned she had the classic symptoms of a panic attack: an unprovoked feeling of extreme fear that produces intense physical sensations ranging from dizziness and trembling to chest pain and shortness of breath.
Experts say it starts when the human survival instinct that fight-or-flight response goes haywire.
Panic is an easily treatable mental illness often triggered by stress, such as the kind Cvijanovic experienced when her grandmother died.
But because the symptoms mimic physical problems such as heart attacks, sufferers often have difficulty getting a correct diagnosis.
``It's like you're stuck on a train track and can't escape,'' Cvijanovic said.
Even successful people like actresses Calista Flockhart (Ally McBeal) and Kim Basinger are among those who suffer panic attacks.
``Patients with panic disorder are really frightened of the internal feelings of anxiety the sweating, palpitations, the bodily changes that can be normal in the course of everyday activities,'' explains Dr. Cynthia Last, a Boca Raton psychologist and director of the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern University.
``They need to desensitize themselves because there are many things that feel like panic, such as when you exercise hard, or get angry, or even have sex.''
Panic disorder is one of several anxiety disorders, which include post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
One in 10 Americans will suffer some form of anxiety, the Anxiety Disorders Association of America estimates.
Theories hold that people who develop anxiety and panic attacks are predisposed to it biologically or environmentally: You might inherit a gene for it although none has been identified or you may be conditioned for it by seeing family members react to stress with fear.
Cvijanovic can't recall anyone in her family who had panic attacks, but she vividly remembers her father dying at home of a brain tumor when she was 14.
``He was gasping for air; he was in a coma.
Cvijanovic's symptoms disappeared after that initial attack, but she feared they would return.
They did, when she was 21.
She can't explain why.
There was nothing particularly stressful going on in her life.
But suddenly she was having several attacks a day and wound up in the hospital emergency room several times a week.
Repeated, unprovoked attacks are also central to panic disorder.
``The doctors kept telling me it was panic, but I wouldn't believe that,'' she said.
The attacks became disabling, making it hard or impossible for her to work, go shopping or otherwise live a normal life.
She was afraid of suffering attacks while she was out and of appearing crazy to people around her.
Left untreated, panic disorder can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of being outside the patient's ``safe'' territory.
Doctors eventually started her on a medication, Klonopin.
``As long as I had the bottle in my hand, even, I was OK.'' Panic sufferers often latch on to items that make them feel safe, but that don't actually help curb the attacks.
Irrational thinking produces panic.
Therapy is designed to ease the catastrophic thoughts that produce fear and the related physical feelings of anxiety.
Patients can be treated with therapy, medication such as antidepressants or tranquilizers, or a combination.
Most therapists discourage drug treatment alone because the patient never learns to control the thinking that causes attacks.
``The research shows that cognitive-behavioral therapy is equally as effective as drugs,'' says Dr. Andrew Rosen, a Delray Beach psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.
``But the therapy has longer-lasting results because it becomes part of the person.
There is greater confidence the person can control it.
As soon as the patient is off medication, if they haven't learned how to change their behavior, they're back to where they were.''
Cvijanovic has experienced a roller coaster ride with panic, and is back in therapy after years of going panic-free.
The attacks returned when she got divorced two years ago.
She now has a flexible job that lets her work at home, but she hopes to return to an office full-time someday.
It's definitely not easy, but I will not let panic attacks get me.
