But how is mental illness defined?
The standard reference used by therapists for diagnosis and for assigning insurance-payment codes is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.
The most recent edition, DSM-IV, which was issued in 1994, lists more than 300 kinds of mental disorders a far cry from the 22 illnesses identified in 1918 in the Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, the precursor to the DSM.
Like its predecessors, DSM-IV provides standardized diagnoses for debilitating mental illnesses like psychoses, major depressions, anxieties, phobias and personality disorders.
But critics contend that the manual contains large gray areas in which ordinary life-adjustment problems and vexing behaviors are classified as mental illnesses requiring clinical treatment.
Here are some disorders found in those gray areas.
Therapists and the courts have always struggled to separate mental illness from bad behavior.
For example, a good percentage of any prison's criminal population would seem to fit the criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7): 1.
Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors ... 2.
Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure.
Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.
Irritability and aggressiveness.
Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.
Consistent irresponsibility ... On the other hand, some behavior classified as mental illness seems to apply to quite functional, if annoying, people.
How could Hollywood or Sunday morning television media-punditry thrive without personalities who exhibit the symptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder (301.50)?

Considers relationships to be more intimate than they really are.
Without doubt, psychiatric treatment is a life-saver for many deeply troubled children.
But given the manual's broad definitions, many parents might question whether every adolescent is certifiable, at least on occasion.
Consider the criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81): 1.
Often loses temper.

Clinicians treating severe drug and alcohol addiction work within a wide range of diagnostic categories.
The following also qualify as ``substance related disorders'': Caffeine Intoxication (305.90): Recent consumption of caffeine in excess of 259 mg (e.g.
But the DSM's diagnostic criteria also suggest that the fretful workaholic with that desktop Snoopy figurine collection may require treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (301.4): 1.
Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost.
Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion ... 3.
Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships ... 4.
Is over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification).
Is unable to discard worn out or worthless objects ... Many critics argue that the DSM often reflects political and cultural biases.
For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness as recently as 1968 in DSM-II, which defined it as Sexual Deviation (302): This category is for individuals whose sexual interests are directed primarily towards objects other than people of the opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus .... The gay-rights movement ultimately pressured the American Psychiatric Association to eliminate homosexuality as a mental disorder in subsequent editions of the DSM.
Cross-dressing males, however, are still categorized as mentally ill if they exhibit the signs of Transvestic Fetishism (302.3): Over a period of at least 6 months in a heterosexual male, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing.
The manual suggests that additional clinical research be devoted to treatment for those who suffer from the symptoms of Identity Problem (313.82): Uncertainty about multiple issues relating to identity, such as long-term goals, career choice, friendship patterns, sexual orientation and behavior, moral values and group loyalties.
Other diagnoses shift with the cultural climate.
The latest DSM, for example, eliminated one controversial diagnosis that was previously applied to women suffering depression, Self-Defeating Personality Disorder (301.90): 1.
Chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure or mistreatment ... 2.
Rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him or her.
Following positive personal events (e.g., a new achievement), responds with depression ... 4.
Incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt, defeated or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public ...).
