It may not really be necessary for law enforcement to intervene between the two disciplines, but there is nevertheless a ``great divide'' that must be closed if research and treatment are to advance more quickly, says a group of Harvard scientists from both fields.
In an article published Tuesday in the journal Neurology, researchers say the animosity of the past stems from a difference of thinking about what causes disease the biology of the brain vs. the psychiatry of the mind.
But the latest science shows biological aspects to psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric aspects to neurological disorders, according to the article by neurologists Bruce H. Price and Raymond D. Adams, and psychiatrist Joseph T. Coyle.
``The two disciplines working together gives far more hope than continuing these old turf wars,'' said Price, chairman of the department of neurology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., in an interview.
Price, the lead author, is also on the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital and the faculty of Harvard Medical School.
The article, meant to stir controversy and debate among the nearly 13,000 members of the American Academy of Neurology, calls for changes in the medical education of both neurologists and psychiatrists, and for better academic leadership in encouraging collaboration between the two disciplines.
Massachusetts has one of the highest per capita concentrations of neurologists in the country, with nearly 10 members of the neurology academy for every 100,000 people, according to the academy's Web site, making it particularly noteworthy that the article in Neurology is authored by Massachusetts scientists, Price said.
Neurology, as a practice, involves the study and treatment of diseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, while psychiatry looks at ailments like depression, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
There has already been cross-fertilization in the two disciplines, with such recent subspecialties as biological psychiatry and neuropsychiatry, and with the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke making multidisciplinary grants.
But specialists in the field said there needs to be even more such collaboration, and welcomed the article in the journal Neurology.
The ``most important point about this article,'' she said, is its summary of the latest evidence that allows doctors to ``refine our viewpoints, update our viewpoints and our theories.''
Among the evidence cited in the article for making the case that the biology of the brain and psychiatry of the mind are inseparable: Brain imaging scans that allow researchers to see differences in people with and without mental illness; studies of the amazing plasticity of the brain, with neurons growing in response to environmental stimuli, like learning; and brain imaging research showing that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder who respond to either behavioral therapy or medication both show the same biologic changes.
``Brain vs. mind.
.it used to be either/or, nature or nurture.
What we're saying is it's really both,'' said Price.
