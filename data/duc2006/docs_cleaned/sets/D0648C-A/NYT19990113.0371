Barry Turner lives alone in a fifth-floor walkup on a quiet street in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn.
He's a nervous man.
Fidgets all the time.
He smokes Kool cigarettes and drinks prodigious amounts of orange Kool-Aid.
He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder.
He takes two types of medication to stave off psychotic episodes.
When I would ride the subways, yeah, my mouth would start twitching.
Yeah.''
He said the crowds on the trains bothered him.
And then the mouth twitching would start and I'd have to get off and wait for another train.
And then my boss would say, `What did you do, go sightseeing?'''
Turner sat at his kitchen table Tuesday and talked about his precarious day-to-day existence.
Five days a week he goes to a state-run psychiatric center in the Cobble Hill neighborhood where he gets his medication and counseling.
The center is affiliated with the South Beach Psychiatric Facility on Staten Island and serves about 500 mentally ill patients.
For Turner, the center has meant the difference between stability and chaos.
``Since South Beach, I seem to feel much better,'' he said.
I'm trying to test myself in the subways and buses to see if I can manage once again to go to work.''
Turner was more nervous than usual during the interview because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had threatened to evict the psychiatric center from its city-owned building and replace it with a homeless shelter.
This was a typically grotesque Giuliani gesture.
Never mind that the psychiatric center by all accounts has been successfully helping troubled individuals for decades, and that it was welcomed by its Cobble Hill neighbors.
The mayor was angry with the local councilman, Stephen DiBrienza, for sponsoring homeless legislation that the mayor didn't like.
So he decided to punish DiBrienza and his constituents by evicting the psychiatric center and forcing a homeless shelter into its space.
The opposition to the mayor's plan was 100 percent.
The New York Times, in an editorial, said, ``This stacks up as revenge politics, no matter how the mayor's aides spin it.''
Five hundred people showed up at a community meeting last week to denounce the mayor's plan.
James Brennan, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the Assembly's Mental Health Committee, sent the mayor a letter that said, ``In my 14 years in office I have never seen a more irresponsible, immature and abusive misuse of high office.''
The Legal Aid Society threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of the mentally ill patients served by the psychiatric center.
After my interview with Turner, I learned that the mayor had bowed to the pressure and backed off.
The psychiatric center can stay, he said.
But other agencies in the six-story building, including programs that help the elderly and young children, will have to go.
Giuliani has raised the politics of cruelty to a high art.
Among the programs to be evicted are Heights and Hills, which provides services to frail and otherwise vulnerable senior citizens, and Families First, a program that offers parenting help and day care to families with children under 3.
``So he's evicting infants, toddlers and elderly folks with Alzheimer's,'' said Brennan.
This is a purely destructive move by the mayor.
No one is unhappy with the programs, but he is unhappy with DiBrienza so he is bulldozing them.
At one point during my visit, Barry Turner stood up from the table and poured a large glass of Kool-Aid.
He drank it down fast, and poured another.
He said yes, the Kools help keep him from coughing.
Later I wondered about the elderly, some of them nervous and forgetful, who will be looking for help in new venues if the mayor gets his way.
And the children whose families may become destabilized without the help they get from Families First.
Politics in the wrong hands can be a terrible thing.
