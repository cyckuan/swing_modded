Midnight couch potatoes take heart: Television's glut of half-hour ads for food dehydrators, countertop broilers and exercise videos will soon be joined by an infomercial about Prozac.
Eli Lilly and Co. has created a 30-minute program on the world's top-selling antidepressant.
It will air on TV stations and cable channels in the middle of the night and on weekends, time slots when more depressed people are expected to be slouched in front of the tube.
Millions of Americans pay about $60 a month for Prozac, which treats depression, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other ills.
Its side effects include sexual dysfunction and sleeplessness.
The infomercial, which begins airing Monday, is aimed mostly at women, with all but two patients featured being female.
It includes shaky camera shots of people who are presumably depressed and testimonials from people who have benefited from Prozac.
``It really gives us an opportunity to tell people about a disease that really goes under-reported or undertreated,'' said the infomercial's host, Freda Lewis-Hall.
The drug generates nearly $3 billion in annual sales for Indianapolis-based Lilly.
