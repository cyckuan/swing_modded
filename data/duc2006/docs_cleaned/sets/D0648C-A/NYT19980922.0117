That seems a conceptual stretch, especially from a young author who is as candid about the pitfalls of taking Prozac including writer's block and sexual dysfunction as she is about the drug's psychologically liberating properties.
Humor, however, turns out to be one of the chief virtues of Lauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' which takes up roughly where the critically acclaimed ``Welcome to My Country,'' her first book about her battle with mental illness, left off.
Material that might be cloying or self-pitying in the hands of a lesser writer sparkles with originality in hers.
The real-life love story of the author and her boyfriend, a chemist, inspires a hilarious episode concerning homeopathy and codependence.
Slater even leaps from a sober meditation on frigidity to the notion that Prozac could be the ultimate tool for radical feminists freeing heterosexual women from the tyranny of libido by rendering men, well, useless.
Elsewhere, she recounts a furious exchange with her doctor after the drug's potency has inexplicably worn off.
Well, the physician suggests, it must be a case of ``Prozac poop-out.''
Slater: ```Prozac poop-out?'
`You've got to be kidding me.'
In her other life, Slater, a psychologist with degrees from Harvard and Boston University, runs an outpatient clinic in East Boston.
Between the ages of 14 and 24, however, she was hospitalized five times for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
An anorexic, she still bears the scars of having sliced herself with razor blades.
Until she found Prozac, Slater had never had a steady boyfriend or a normal relationship with food or a semblance of a vocation, other than writing poetry and short stories.
Then, in 1988, she was given the potent antidepressant that had just hit the market.
Slater began with 20 milligrams daily; she would wind up with a prescription for four times that dosage.
Her initial reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that her doctor doubted it could be real.
She felt high, Slater writes acid-trip high.
She was a 26-year-old with ``the judgment of an early adolescent,'' as she describes it.
Meeting a stranger at a rock concert, she follows him to a park and reluctantly has sex with him.
With her liberation come dangers for which Slater is totally unprepared.
She gets a job teaching literacy skills to immigrants.
She gains acceptance to graduate school.
From small triumphs keeping an apartment, managing a checkbook she moves on to far greater ones.
Meanwhile, she finds herself surrendering to the drug's deeper spiritual and philosophical mysteries.
``Secretly,'' writes Slater, ``I started to fear a nuclear war only for the effects it would have on the pharmacies.''
Each step forward is dogged by doubt, however.
Illness has been so strong a component of her identity that its absence causes Slater to panic.
Her intellectual affinity for philosophers and theologians causes Slater to liken Prozac to a ``Zen drug'' and herself to a Buddhist novitiate: another side effect not advertised by the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly.
``Maybe Prozac has made me into a nun,'' the author worries, ``or a nurse, or worse, a Calgon Lady.''
She contests Peter Kramer's assertion in ``Listening to Prozac'' that the drug makes its users ``better than well.''
Instead, Slater suggests, Prozac is more like ``psychotropic Drano'' a remedy that trades higher functioning for addiction and the frustrating loss of creativity.
``Prozac Diary'' is made up of notes and journal entries, scraps of memory, and letters to Slater's doctor.
The collage effect notwithstanding, the book is tightly bound by its humor and intelligence.
Slater's writing is confessional without being sentimental, honest without being overbearing.
While she has tried to wean herself off Prozac, Slater still depends on it, she writes, to get along with her life and career.
On good days, she calculates, that means functioning at 70 percent capacity.
``Prozac is a medicine that takes much away,'' the author concludes, ``but its very presence in my life has been about preserving as well as decaying.''
With wit and courage, she makes that presence felt.
