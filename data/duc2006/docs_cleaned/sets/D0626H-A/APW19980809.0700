The bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook furniture in homes a mile away.
But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have prevented the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya, an official said Saturday.
Another reason was the location a quiet tree-lined neighborhood.
The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's laid-back capital of swaying palms and sparse traffic, is largely free from the congestion that plagues most other major African cities.
