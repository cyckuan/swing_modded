Tanzanian and an Egyptian face death by hanging after Tanzanian authorities charged the men with murder in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania.
Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed each were charged with 11 counts of murder.
The Aug. 7 bombing killed 11 people, all Africans.
Resident Magistrate Amiri Maneto said no bail was allowed.
Police and soldiers stood guard while the two men arrived at the courthouse, in the center of Dar es Salaam.
Three FBI agents also were present at the hearing.
Although no details were released in court, local media said traces of chemicals that could have been used to make the bomb had been found in Saleh's home and car.
Police, the reports said, also were seeking two unidentified men who had visited Saleh often before the bombing.
No information was available on why charges were filed against Ahmed, who authorities said also is known as Said Ahmed and Saleh Aben Alahales.
Ahmed told the court he couldn't understand why he was charged because he was not even in Dar es Salaam on the day of the bombing.
He said he was in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
Ahmed, a heavyset and bearded man, wore glasses, a gray T-shirt and faded slacks.
Saleh, slender and bearded, did not make a statement.
He is a native of Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania.
The National Disaster Operation Center in Nairobi confirmed on Monday the death of a woman injured in the blast, bringing the death toll to 248.
Two men have been indicted in federal court in New York in the murders of the 12 Americans slain in the bombing in Kenya, and several other suspects were being sought.
Among them is Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who allegedly runs al Qaida, a radical Islamic network accused of planning the bombings.
