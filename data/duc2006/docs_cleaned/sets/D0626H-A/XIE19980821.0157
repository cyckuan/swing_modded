The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi seconds before the deadly bomb exploded on August 7 has been positively identified as two more people arrested, Kenya's national newspapers said Friday.
Khalid Mohammed, a suspect held by the Kenyan-U.S. joint probe team following the bomb raid, was picked out by three of eight witnesses Thursday, according to a report from the Daily Nation newspaper.
The report said it now appears that only two suicide bombers died in the blast, compared with earlier reports that all the three bombers who drove to the embassy died.
"The man who was positively identified was slightly injured by the August 7 blast but he escaped with minor wounds which have healed.
This is the man who jumped from the pick-up at the parking bay of the embassy, hurled a grenade at the guards before the bomb exploded," the report quoted a source as saying.
It said Khalid, who can not speak English or Kiswahili but only Arabic, was identified by a guard and a civilian worker at the embassy and a third witness.
The witnesses also sustained injuries from flying objects.
Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freech is expected to issue a statement about the bombing probe before he leaves Nairobi for Washington at noon Friday.
He came here Thursday evening after a one-day visit to Tanzania.
On Thursday, the investigators also raided offices of Mercy Relief International Agency, a non-governmental organization, in the Kenyan capital Thursday and arrested an Arab and a Sudanese, the East African Standard newspaper reported.
Local sources said the plan to bomb U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somali and Rwanda.
The car bomb attack at the u.s. embassy in Nairobi reportedly killed 253 people and injured some 5,000 more.
President Bill Clinton Thursday ordered air raids on terror facilities allegedly used by Laden in Afghanistan and Sudan in a clear revenge attack for the bombings.
Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.
