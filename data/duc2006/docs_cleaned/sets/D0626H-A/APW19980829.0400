Police said Saturday that seven people had been arrested in a sweep following the bombing of the U.S. Embassy here three weeks ago, but did not say whether those detained were suspected in connection with the attack.
The seven were arrested earlier this week near the Tanzanian border port of Tunduma, on the Zambian frontier, said a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity.
Their identitities and nationalities were not disclosed.
The suspects were reportedly sent to the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam under heavy police escort.
Police had been staging a nationwide manhunt for suspects since the August 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which killed 11 people.
