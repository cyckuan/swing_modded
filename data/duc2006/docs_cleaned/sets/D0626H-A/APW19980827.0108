Yemeni citizen who is a suspect in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi has been flown to the United States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
The East African Standard, owned by a group of businessmen close to president Daniel arap Moi's Kenyan African National Union party, reported that unidentified sources said the FBI flew Khalid Salim to the United States on Wednesday night.
It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the FBI, which has about 200 agents in Kenya investigating the Aug. 7 bombing.
Kenyan police also refused comment.
The powerful blast, believed to have been caused by a car bomb, killed 247 people, including 12 Americans in the embassy building.
Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an unspecified number of people for questioning.
But no list of detainees has been made public and no charges appear to have been filed against anyone.
Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among three jailed suspects who told police they ran a phony fishmongering business as a cover in preparing to bomb the embassy.
The newspaper also said the three suspects confessed to authorities that they had carried out surveillance prior to the attack.
Neither Kenyan police nor FBI officials investigating the bombing would comment on the report.
One of the suspects, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly arrested in Karachi, Pakistan, on Aug. 7 as he arrived from Nairobi.
He was returned to Kenya on Aug. 14, and is said to be either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
Local newspapers refer to him as the prime suspect in the bombing, but the FBI has refused all comment.
