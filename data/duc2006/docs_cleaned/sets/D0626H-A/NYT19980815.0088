Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence connecting Bin Laden to the bombings.
But Saturday's issue of Newsday reported that a witness had identified a Bin Laden associate as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more than 200 people.
The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of the bombing.
In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement officials who asked not to be identified said there had not been positive identification of the suspect, who was described as a relatively low-level member of Bin Laden's circle.
But officials indicated that this was the first potential evidence leading to Bin Laden, whom the FBI and the CIA have suspected from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot.
American officials have cited him since the early hours of the investigation.
This year he renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the United States, and senior officials have said he has a network in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he has operatives in Kenya.
Although officials caution that there has been no hard evidence linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings, Americans point to the nearly simultaneous explosions on Aug. 7 as a sign that the attacks were carried out by sophisticated terrorists.
Bin Laden's network has the financial resources and the organization to have been the mastermind, the officials said.
Another group suspected by the United States is the Cairo-based Islamic Jihad, but it, too, is financed by Bin Laden, American officials said.
The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the construction business, Bin Laden is thought to have been involved in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
But for lack of evidence, the United States has never issued an arrest warrant for him.
Bin Laden lived for a time in the Sudan.
He is said to live in Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country.
