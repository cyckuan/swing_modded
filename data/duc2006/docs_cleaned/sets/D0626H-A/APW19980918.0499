Tanzania has expelled 14 foreigners questioned in connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy here.
Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said Thursday that five Iraqis, five Sudanese, two Libyans, one Turk and another person whose nationality was not given were handed over by police to immigration authorities on Aug. 27 for expulsion.
``Lack of direct evidence to connect them to the bomb atttack at the U.S. Embassy in the city was a major reason for their release,'' Chilambo said.
He did not say when the expulsions took place, but he did say that two of the Sudanese remained in his department's custody pending investigation to determine whether they will be declared prohibited immigrants.
The Aug. 7 blast at the embassy in a residential neighborhood killed 11 people.
In neighboring Kenya, an almost simultaneous explosion at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi killed 247 people, 12 of them Americans.
Two men are in custody in the United States in connection with the murder of the 12 Americans in Nairobi, and a third is being sought.
In the northern city of Arusha Thursday, Adadi Rajabu, director of the police Criminal Investigations Division who is also the head of the task force looking into the bombing, said police are still holding two principal suspects a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose nationality he would not reveal.
Rajabu said three other people, including the owner of a metal workshop where the explosive device reportedly was attached to a vehicle, were in detention and helping police with the investigation.
