The United States is concerned over more "terrorist" attacks by forces of Osama bin Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
"We have noted recent activity similar to what occurred prior to the African embassy bombings... And I must tell you we are concerned that one or more of bin Laden's attacks could occur at any time," Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
"We are anticipating bombing attempts with conventional explosives, but his operatives are also capable of kidnappings and assassinations," he said.
Saudi suspect bin Laden is accused of plotting the bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August that killed 250 people.
"There is not the slightest doubt that Osama bin Laden, his worldwide allies, and his sympathizers are planning further attacks against us," Tenet said.
The United States is offering up to 5 million dollars for information leading to bin Laden's arrest or conviction for his alleged role in the embassy bombings.
