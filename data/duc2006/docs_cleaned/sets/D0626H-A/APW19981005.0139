magistrate Monday granted a prosecution request to release into police custody one of two suspects charged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy to assist in the investigation for five days.
During a 10-minute hearing, Chief Resident Magistrate Projest Rugazia granted the prosecution request that Rashid Saleh Hemed be released into the custody of Asst.
Police Commissioner Robert Manumba.
Hemed, a Tanzanian from Zanzibar, and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed were formally charged Sept. 21 in the Aug. 7 bombing of the embassy in which 11 people, all Africans, were killed.
Another 70 were injured.
In a nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in neighboring Kenya, 248 people, 12 of them Americans, were killed.
Another 5,400 were injured.
After the hearing was adjourned, reporters were able to speak briefly with Ahmed, who told them he had gone to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam the day after the bombing and told British diplomats and FBI agents there what he knew about the bombing.
Ahmed repeated earlier claims that he had told both Tanzanian and Kenyan officials late last year about plans to bomb the embassy in Dar es Salaam.
It was not immediately possible to obtain confirmation from the British diplomatic mission that Ahmed had gone there three times, the last on Aug. 18, as he claimed.
Both men appeared in court dressed in the same clothes they were wearing at the Sept. 21 hearing, but their hair and beards had been trimmed.
Hemed appeared to be in his mid-20s, Ahmed in his late 30s.
Rugazia set the next hearing for Oct. 19.
Two suspects have been indicted in a U.S. federal court in New York in connection with the Nairobi bombing, a third is a fugitive, a fourth is awaiting extradition in Germany and a fifth has been charged in New York with lying to investigations about his relationship to Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the bombings.
