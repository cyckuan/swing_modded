George W. Bush's recent meeting with gay Republicans now want the probable GOP presidential nominee to meet with them so they can enlighten him about ``the homosexual political agenda.''
``The homosexual agenda is incompatible with family life,'' the groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention, told Bush in a letter saying he should meet with them to ``demonstrate your commitment to the family by ... meeting with those of us who believe that homosexual activism poses a serious threat to our marriage-based culture and to the freedoms of speech, religion and association.''
Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush meets with pro-family leaders ``all the time'' but no decision has been made on whether he would sit down with the groups who sent the letter.
``He agrees with them on the importance of families and the sanctity of marriage,'' McClellan said, adding, ``Governor Bush is running an inclusive campaign and he welcomes the support of all Americans.''
The meeting request comes as Bush steps up his efforts to offer a bipartisan and inclusive image that includes inviting support from gay voters.
After months of declining to meet with leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, Bush earlier this month huddled privately with 12 gay Republicans hand-picked by his campaign.
Included was former U.S. Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, who said the session meant that ``never again will a major-party candidate be able to run for president without addressing gay and lesbian issues.''
On Thursday, Gunderson criticized the letter from the groups as something less than a request for ``dialogue or honest conversation.''
``There is a desire for a confrontation and an ultimatum,'' he said.
Gunderson said the letter is indicative of how tricky the equation is as Bush tries to put a more tolerant face on their party.
``There is no question that the struggle within the Republican Party is to hold together an increasingly diverse coalition,'' said Gunderson.
``And we all need to help manage it.
The 12 groups said they want to tell Bush ``the facts behind the homosexual political agenda that often go unreported.''
``Homosexual activists are trying to use the Republican Party, much like the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to achieve their strategic objective of harnessing government and corporate power to impose acceptance of homosexual behavior,'' the groups told Bush, adding that gay groups ``seek nothing less than the ability to mandate teaching to schoolchildren that homosexuality is normal and healthy.''
``The legal attack on the Boy Scouts is the most visible example of where this agenda will lead if it is not firmly and actively opposed,'' the groups told Bush.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments in a case sparked by the Boy Scouts' expulsion of a New Jersey leader who is gay.
Bush's foray into gay issues also comes as some conservative groups are angered over the Vermont Legislature's approval this week of marriage-like ``gay unions,'' and shortly before Sunday's ``Millennium March'' in Washington that is expected to attract 300,000 supporters of gay rights.
Organizers hope the rally will highlight the issue in a presidential election year.
Bush has tried to reach out to gay voters without embracing their positions.
After his meeting with the gay Republicans, Bush said his message to conservatives upset about the session would be, ``I welcome gay Americans into my campaign.
But I want the conservative Republicans to understand that we judge people based upon their heart and soul, and while we disagree on gay marriage, for example, we agree on a lot of other issues and it's important for people to hear that.''
Bush said he was a ``better person'' for having met with the gay Republicans, and that their life stories were ``very compelling.''
Though he said he welcomed gay voters into his campaign, Bush reiterated his opposition to initiatives of importance to that community, including same-sex marriages, adoptions by gay couples and expanding anti-hate crime laws to treat homosexuals in the same manner as racial and ethnic minorities.
The meeting upset some conservative Republicans, including former presidential contender Gary Bauer who said it ``elevated the gay rights agenda to a level of recognition within the Republican Party that contradicts our long-standing commitment to pro-family values.''
In their letter to Bush, the conservative groups, including the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and Concerned Women for America, indicated that they agree with Bauer.
``You will find that homosexual activists will not be satisfied with the civil rights all Americans enjoy.
They do not want tolerance; that's what they have.
They demand acceptance of their lifestyle and protection for their practices.
This will devastate family life and wholly undermine your plans to restore the morale of our military,'' the groups told Bush.
