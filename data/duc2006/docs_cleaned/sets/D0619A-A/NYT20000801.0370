Homosexual Republicans rejoiced, but religious conservative delegates sat in silent protest Tuesday as their party's only openly gay congressman addressed the Republican National Convention.
Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona did not mention sexual orientation in his three-minute speech on free trade.
But gay delegates and their supporters said his presence on the podium in prime time was proof that presidential candidate George W. Bush is serious about making the GOP more inclusive.
The gay Republicans are also heartened that the GOP presidential campaign seems to be welcoming Mary Cheney, 31, the openly lesbian daughter of vice-presidential pick Dick Cheney.
She appeared with her father in the convention hall on Monday night to the cheers of the delegates.
``It's a pretty vivid reminder that gays are part of the American family,'' said Kevin Ivers, communications director for the Log Cabin Republicans.
``We're thrilled,'' David Catania, an openly gay delegate and councilman from the District of Columbia, said of Kolbe's speech.
``This is something that means a great deal to gay Republicans.''
But other delegates disapproved of Bush's choice.
``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to claim victory for their agenda,'' Texas GOP chair Susan Weddington told the Associated Press.
Dozens of delegates in the Texas delegation sat with their heads bowed and eyes closed as Kolbe spoke.
One held up a sign saying, ``There is a way out.''
The Republican platform opposes gay marriages, gays in the military and express legal protection for sexual orientation.
Applause for Kolbe was restrained in comparison to the raucous reception given to most speakers.
The muted reaction was as close to dissention as the convention has come in two evenings devoted to showing a new, more tolerant face of the GOP.
After years of political rejection, gay Republicans and their backers said the choice of Kolbe as a convention speaker furthered the message of inclusion that Bush is sending through the convention.
``We're happy to see changes taking place at our convention,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
In 1992, there were two openly gay GOP delegates, he recalled, while this year there are 18 to 20.
``This is a party that's trying to expand its base,'' said Catania, who was among a dozen gay Republicans who met with Bush in Austin in April.
That meeting ended with disagreement on a lot of issues, he conceded, ``but the governor agreed to keep an open mind.''
``It's a great step in the right direction,'' said Fred Ronstadt, Linda's cousin and a Tucson city councilman whose wife works on Kolbe's campaign.
``Our party needs to be inclusive.''
At a reception sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, Kolbe stressed he was chosen to speak because of his economic views and not his private life.
Kolbe, 58, acknowledged being gay in 1996, but has not been an outspoken activist on gay issues.
As chairman of an Appropriations subcommittee, he has led overseas trade missions.
In recent sessions, he pushed for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China.
For the convention, ``he was well chosen to be the spokesman for free trade,'' said Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md.
