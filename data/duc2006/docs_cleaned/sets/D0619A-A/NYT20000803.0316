As Republicans wrapped up their convention intended to highlight inclusiveness, gay political organizations squared off Thursday over whether the party has a newfound moderation toward homosexuals.
Leaders of the nation's largest gay political organization said the GOP national convention demonstrated ``meanness'' toward gays and that the election of presidential nominee George W. Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights.
``The verdict is in,'' Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights Campaign, said as Bush prepared to deliver his acceptance speech.
Bush-Cheney administration has the potential to be very harmful for gays and lesbians.
It is clear that the kinder, gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than a facade.''
Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said that the four-day affair was disappointing, even though the GOP sought to soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., to address delegates.
Kolbe is openly gay.
The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
The Human Rights Campaign already has endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president.
Birch said she was ```very disturbed'' by the GOP platform, which included language gay Republicans wanted removed.
Birch said ``a kind of meanness won out'' when the platform was finalized on Monday.
The platform defines marriage ``as the legal union of one man and one woman.''
It says that ``federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages.''
And the platform further says that homosexuals should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a four-minute speech on international trade.
Several members of Bush's own Texas delegation removed their cowboy hats and bowed their heads in prayer.
Birch noted the irony of the Republican position, saying that Cheney's daughter Mary is openly lesbian.
``The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines a light on the fact that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have positions of grave concern to gay and lesbian people in this country,'' Birch said.
But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
Ivers said that the ``old social conservative paradigm'' in the Republican party this week ``is showing signs that is is crumbling.''
''We've seen real advances this week,`` he said, pointing to a platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay language, only to be overruled by conservatives.
The fact that Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at reaching out to gay Republicans, he said, adding that most of the 2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily.
One other indication that the party is warming to gays: there were more openly gay convention delegates (19) to this GOP convention than at any previous.
There were five gay delegates in 1996 and two alternates in 1992, Ivers said.
``This week was a success.
We are at a turning point (in the Republican Party) on gay and lesbian issues,'' Ivers said.
Bush's relationship with gays and lesbians has been strained.
During the Republican primaries, Bush at first refused to meet with gay rights groups.
But in April, he met with gay Republicans saying afterwards that he was ``a better man'' for it.
Republicans also note that Cheney, while secretary of defense in 1991, supported his spokesman, Pete Williams, when he announced he was gay.
As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in a responsible manner, their private lives are their business,'' Cheney said.
