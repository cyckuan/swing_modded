House Republicans are about to go after the sinners.
Most federal agencies already had nondiscriminatory policies, though with slight differences here and there.
The main effect of Clinton's order is to impose uniformity, so what's the big deal?
The big deal is that in its thralldom to the religious right and its increasing tilt to ideological rather than to pragmatic conservatism, the Republican Party has gone from being just a little cracked about homosexuality to being outright peculiar.
Commonly cited as evidence of that have been the recent declarations by Senate and House Majority Leaders Trent Lott and Dick Armey that homosexuality is a sin, but both men were only answering questions they didn't seem pleased to have been asked and sin is a religious, not a political, judgment.
They are welcome to it.
(Though Lott also seemed to think homosexuality is a mental disorder or an addiction.
The American Psychiatric Association concluded otherwise 25 years ago, in effect finding that most folks are heterosexual but a few are not and there you are.)
Far more disturbing is the worsening demagoguery of the party and its candidates in demonizing gays and lesbians as a shortcut to office.
Here's the U.S. House of Representatives on the verge of all but endorsing job discrimination against gays and lesbians by disallowing an order forbidding that.
The Texas Republican Party recently denied recognition at its convention to the Log Cabin Republicans, a sobersided club of gay Republicans.
And when the group complained, delegates unleashed a torrent of abuse, with state leaders comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan.
Lott is blocking the appointment of a gay as ambassador to Luxembourg.
(In the course of which issue Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., likened the nominee to the former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke.
Klan analogies apparently are going around.)
This year's GOP gubernatorial primary in Nebraska sank into a contest in homophobia, with candidates competing in the vigor of their oaths to block homosexual marriage, which the conservative state legislature has never even considered.
Republican primaries in South Carolina, too, have set off a bidding war in anti-gay rhetoric, most bizarrely with a would-be agriculture commissioner declaring homosexuality a threat to family farms.
``You can't have farming based on having Bob and Bob being married,'' said Jim Gordon.
All this posturing is put about as a defense of morality but it is no such thing.
Republican candidates in many places no longer can win without certification from fundamentalist Christian pulpits, and as one GOP ally put it, when Republicans are quoting the Bible and Democrats are citing the American Psychiatric Association, Republicans win.
Count on it: When politics is talking about saving souls, it is thinking about counting heads.
