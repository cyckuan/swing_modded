Exposing a deep political fissure in the Republican party, UC Regent Ward Connerly and several other prominent GOP party members announced their opposition Thursday to Proposition 22, a measure on the March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
The initiative, which was put on the ballot by state Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, is broadly supported by state Republicans.
But Connerly, who led the campaign for the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, said gay rights are a matter of personal freedom and not an area where the government should be involved.
Thursday's statement by Connerly, GOP Senate candidate Tom Campbell, and state Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, comes on the heels of several other public battles within the Republican Party.
Only last year, for example, a splinter group of moderate state Republicans held an alternative convention to adopt a pro-choice platform.
The statement also comes as leaders are hoping the rank and file will unite behind the party's candidates.
In less than two weeks, the state GOP will meet in Burlingame to adopt a party platform.
``What you are seeing is symptomatic of the problems the party has had for the past five years,'' said GOP consultant Mike Madrid.
``The base of the party has remained unchanged, while the demographics in California have changed dramatically.
``The question is, how do you broaden the base of the party when the core is so intense on certain key issues?''
Madrid said.
Supporters of Proposition 22 deny that there is any division among Republicans, citing the support of the California Republican Party and 56 GOP members of the Legislature and congressional delegation.
``I'm not at all surprised to see the author of Prop.
But the president of the California Republican League, a group that promotes inclusion in the party, said such issues hurt Republicans.
``There is this notion that we put this stuff on the ballot as a `wedge' issue and promote wedge-issue politics it feeds the notion that Republicans are into dividing people,'' said Gary Zlotnick, the league's president.
Connerly also said Republicans suffer from their public image.
``We may have a more difficult time than the Democrats because some think it is written somewhere that we should oppress gays,'' he said.
``Some people invoke the Bible and don't think it through.
But Democrats come out against the initiative and then dance around the real issues.''
Both Democratic presidential hopefuls, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have come out against the initiative but oppose same-sex marriage.
