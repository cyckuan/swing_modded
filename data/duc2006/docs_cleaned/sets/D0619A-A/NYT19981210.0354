West Texas legislator is sponsoring a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from becoming foster parents or adopting children in state custody, prompting a sharp attack from a gay Republican group.
``This bill is offensive, and I think any fair-minded individual will find this bill to be offensive,'' said Steve Labinski, president of Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which advocates equal treatment of homosexuals in the GOP.
The proposal, filed this week by state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, would direct Child Protective Services not to place children in homes with homosexual parents and defines their sexual practices as ``deviate.''
Private adoptions would not be affected, but thousands of children at risk could be.
Currently the state oversees 17,578 foster children and last year approved 1,548 adoptions.
Labinski called Chisum's proposal ``unrepublican'' and said it hardly echoes the concept of ``compassionate conservatism'' championed by Gov.
