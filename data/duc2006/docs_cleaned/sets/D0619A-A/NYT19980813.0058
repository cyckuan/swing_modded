Gay Republicans call it the Selma of their own civil rights movement: Dallas, where the religious right dominates the GOP the way liberals dominate politics in San Francisco.
It was in Dallas two months ago that the spokesman for the Texas Republican Party, Robert Black, called the Log Cabin Republicans a ``deviant group'' like the Ku Klux Klan and denied the gay organization a booth at the state party convention.
``We don't allow pedophiles, transvestites and cross-dressers, either,'' he explained.
``Being a gay Republican in Texas is a little like being a black Democrat in Mississippi in the 1950s,'' said Dale Carpenter, Texas director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
``You're involved in a party that doesn't really want you, where you're excluded, discriminated against, segregated.''
When the Log Cabins protested their exclusion from the convention, they were met with venomous counterprotesters who shouted slurs, shoved and pushed them and waved signs saying ``God Hates Fags.''
So it is in Dallas this weekend that about 200 Log Cabin Republicans from around the country will gather for the group's national convention, challenging the GOP to come to terms with the gays and lesbians in their own ideological family.
``We are everywhere in society.''
Log Cabin Executive Director Rich Tafel said gay Republicans should fight rather than switch parties to prevent the GOP from becoming a Republican version of George Wallace Democrats.
``If you're a Republican and you believe in individual rights, less government and free markets, the Republican Party holds those principles still,'' Tafel said.
``Gay Republicans are simply saying, `We're staying and fighting for those principles.'
Sharpening the irony of the debate, the Log Cabin Republicans have invited two conservative icons to address their convention: University of California Regent Ward Connerly and Washington political pundit Arianna Huffington.
Huffington has rebuked her fellow conservatives for their intolerance of homosexuality.
The group also invited Andrew Sullivan, a prominent gay Catholic activist who advocates gay marriage as a conservative family value.
The debate over gay rights is part of a larger and more politically dangerous battle over the direction of the Republican Party.
Connerly and his allies in the party's libertarian wing believe that the GOP should represent limited government, low taxes and individual freedom including the freedom to live as a gay person.
On the other wing are the social or religious conservatives, whose greatest concern is what they see as America's moral decline, reflected by crime and the breakup of the traditional family unit.
For social conservatives, homosexuals embody all that is wrong with America a deviant lifestyle that in their view subverts religious and family values.
Like abortion, the gay movement evokes the kind of emotional force that can bring social conservatives running to the voting booth.
And that is just what the GOP needs this November, when control of the House of Representatives will hinge on which party can best energize its core supporters.
Social conservative activists such as Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council and a potential presidential contender, and James Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show, have made homosexuality a major campaign theme, running full-page advertisements in major newspapers about how ``ex-gays'' renounced their homosexual lifestyle.
``It's one of those things that the party is very uncomfortable with,'' said an aide to a high-ranking House Republican.
``For some segments of the party, the whole gay issue is taboo, and the Gary Bauers of the world exert a lot of influence on them.''
But some party leaders are taking steps to address the matter head-on.
For the first time, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, will meet with the Log Cabin Republicans on Aug. 21.
``We enjoy the support not just of straight Republicans and straight Americans, but gay and bisexual Americans as well,'' said party spokesman Mike Collins.
``We want their support.
They want lower taxes, they want a balanced budget, they want to take people off welfare and give them jobs.
We're doing that.
And we welcome their support.''
Collins' comments reflect a considerable fear within the party that anti-gay rhetoric will cast the GOP as intolerant or bigoted.
But he noted that even former Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed is urging Republicans to back away.
Every time you have this sort of `we want to tell you how to run your life' behavior, it makes it harder for Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest to gain ground.''
Jim Pinkerton, a former political strategist for Bush, said that while religious conservatives may think promoting anti-gay views is a good idea, the Republican Party as a whole does not.
The party is having a difficult time accommodating both sides.
And the public itself is of two minds: Polls consistently show that a large majority of the public condemns discrimination but at the same time does not approve of homosexuality or bringing ``queer values to suburbia,'' as Pinkerton put it.
Pinkerton argues that Republicans do need the support of social conservatives.
``But they should find better ways to do it,'' he says, ``by promoting such issues as school choice that animate religious conservatives, libertarians and minorities alike who are dissatisfied with public schools.''
Arizona's Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in the House, said many of his colleagues ``sincerely wish this thing would not come up and not be voted on, because of the obvious conflicts it puts them in.''
But Texas Republicans see no conflict.
Party spokesman Robert Black defended the decision to exclude the Log Cabin Republicans from the GOP convention, saying individuals are free to participate in the state party, but not ``narrow special interest groups.''
Asked why the Christian Coalition was allowed a booth, Black said, ``OK, let me redefine that.
Republicans, at least here in Texas, by and large are against homosexuality.
That's not really news.
It's in our platform.''
Tafel said that is why the Log Cabin Republicans will be in Dallas this weekend.
``We really view Texas as the frontlines of the gay movement,'' Tafel said.
``It's important for the gay community, in general, that gay Republicans stay and fight because that's the frontlines, that's where the battles are taking place.''
