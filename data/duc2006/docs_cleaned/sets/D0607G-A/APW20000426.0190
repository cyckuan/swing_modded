China's stepped up bomber flights and naval maneuvers set off a dispute Wednesday between Taiwanese defense officials and experts on whether the moves were an attempt to intimidate Taiwan.
The news of the military activity detected by Taiwan's intelligent services made the front pages of the island's leading newspapers Wednesday, sending Taiwan's jittery stock market down 4.3 percent.
Military officials said the drills might be a prelude to threatening war games to intimidate the island as its new president, Chen Shui-bian, prepares to take office May 20.
Chen has said he has no plans to seek independence unless China attacks to force a reunification.
Sun Tao-yu, vice-minister of defense, doubted that the recent military maneuvers were unusual.
He said China holds exercises every spring because of good weather.
But Sun said the military had to inform the public ''to remind the people of the concept of national defense'' on the island that split with China 51 years ago amid civil war.
Ting Yu-chou, chairman of the National Security Bureau, said Taiwan's military ''was jumping to conclusions,'' the United Evening News reported.
Ting said the air drills were normal and there were no indications of large-scale ground exercises.
Lin Chong-pin, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council which handles Taiwan's China policy, said the maneuvers were part of the mainland's psychological warfare against the island.
Beijing repeatedly has threatened to attack if Taiwan refuses to reunify and declares independence.
Lin, an expert on China's People's Liberation Army, said Beijing was trying to intimidate Taiwan into starting reunification talks because Chinese leaders lack the confidence to act on their threats of an all-out war with the island.
War, Lin said, was unlikely because China's leaders fear war would bring social unrest, economic upheaval and threaten their hold on power.
China's leaders also realize that war with Taiwan would involve the United States, which has shown ''a more positive attitude'' toward the island despite its recognition of Beijing, Lin said.
Former military chief Hau Pei-tsun, who was visited by president-elect Chen, said that the drills ''looked like normal air force exercises.''
Chen in turn urged China to use peaceful methods to improve ties .
''We want peace, harmony, cooperation,'' he said.
