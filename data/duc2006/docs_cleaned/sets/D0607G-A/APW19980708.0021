Farmers upset over high government taxes drove their tractors into an eastern Chinese city to block traffic in protest, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported Wednesday.
The demonstration Tuesday in Bengbu marked the latest outburst of discontent by farmers and workers who feel harmed by China's capitalist-style reforms and neglected by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
About 100 farmers from Mopanzhang village outside Bengbu pulled their tractors in front of the city's government office building Tuesday morning, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
One unidentified demonstrator told the rights group that the government had raised taxes and fees despite an appeal by China's legislature in March ``to reduce the peasants' burdens.''
Large numbers of police were sent to the scene and the farmers agreed to leave peacefully around noontime after meeting with a city official to discuss their grievances, the rights group said.
Farmers and workers were once treated as protected, revolutionary classes by the ruling Communist Party.
Their current disaffection threatens to further undermine the party's tattered legitimacy and poses a challenge to its continued rule.
