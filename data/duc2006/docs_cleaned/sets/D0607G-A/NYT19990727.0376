That is disturbing behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to economic reform and modernization and that signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's omnipresent police.
Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President Jiang Zemin.
Special factors may explain the vehemence of Beijing's moves against the Falun Gong.
Rapidly growing religious cults are particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their historical role in sparking unrest.
New religious groups have grown in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void.
The Falun Gong's emergence also coincides with economic strains.
Growth rates are falling and unemployment rising.
New reforms advocated by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.
None of this justifies the persecutions now under way.
For most of its followers, the Falun Gong is not about protest but traditional Chinese techniques of exercise, breathing and meditation believed to channel the body's spiritual energy.
Those who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising internationally recognized rights of association and expression for which they should not be punished or forced to submit to ideological training.
Beijing's repression may only deepen public disenchantment with the authorities, and could divert energies from carrying out needed economic reforms.
China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination methods of the past.
