An account in The Washington Post this week described three days of violent rioting over job cuts and corruption that overwhelmed local police forces and continued until regular army troops arrived.
This is just the kind of social upheaval that terrifies the leadership in Beijing, who well know that protests by disenchanted citizens could someday escalate again into a serious threat to Communist rule.
Hundreds of economic protests, some of them violent, have erupted across China in recent years, rarely, if ever reported in the Chinese news media.
The Yangjiazhangzi events were unusually unruly, but worker and peasant protests have become increasingly frequent.
Market reforms like the privatization of large state companies produce unemployment and social dislocation.
When this takes place in an atmosphere of pervasive government corruption, popular anger is understandable.
Unless Beijing enforces higher ethical standards on local officials, unrest could soon become even more widespread.
State companies are scheduled to lay off more than 10 million workers before the end of this year.
Anger over alleged corruption seems to have played a major role in Yangjiazhangzi.
Miners, a formidable protest group in many societies, were already aggrieved over economic issues.
Last November, most of the mine was shut down, but some of its facilities and equipment were apparently transferred to new private owners alleged to be friends of local officials.
What detonated the violence was the belated announcement of an extremely modest severance package for the laid-off workers.
The contrast between what looked like an undeserved windfall for the well connected and the shabby treatment of longtime employees became even more of an affront when mine authorities refused to show up at a peaceful protest meeting.
For several years now, Communist leaders in Beijing have seemed haunted by fears of explosive social unrest.
Their answer has generally been repression, along with strident nationalist campaigns designed to distract the country's attention from economic grievances.
Instead, Beijing should crack down on the corruption that has grown worse with the progress of economic reform.
Show trials of a few spectacularly corrupt individuals have not been enough to discourage others on the take.
Market reforms have benefited China and brightened economic prospects for many of its workers and peasants.
But the current phase of selling off state factories and mines is creating hardships for many longtime employees.
When they see local party officials drawing illicit profits from their sacrifices, they are sure to protest.
Beijing should heed the message from Yangjiazhangzi.
