Even before China regained sovereignty over this former British colony 16 months ago, authorities began to remove the face of Queen Elizabeth II from stamps, redesign the flag and repaint royal-crested mailboxes.
Yet today, one of the most obvious signs of British rule remains.
Emblazoned in huge letters on the local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army is a strikingly inappropriate name: the Prince of Wales Building.
Before the 1997 handover, pundits predicted that China would rip the letters from the harborside tower as soon as People's Liberation Army troops arrived.
The troops are here, but the name remains on the barracks.
China's decision to leave it there seems a deliberate move to remain as discreet as possible.
And for good reason.
Here in Hong Kong, where one in six people marched to protest the 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, distrust of the Chinese soldiers ran deep.
Half of Hong Kong's residents are refugees from China or descendants of refugees, and many worried that the new government might use troops to curtail their liberties.
But so far, doomsayers' predictions have fallen flat.
Far from cracking down on demonstrators, the People's Liberation Army has become all but invisible here.
``They have been told to lie low, stay in their barracks, not to mingle with the public, and for this they were rewarded with medals and citations when Jiang Zemin visited on the anniversary of the handover,'' said Willy Lam, China editor of the daily South China Morning Post.
``They were rewarded for doing nothing, for staying out of trouble.''
Aware of the People's Liberation Army image problem, China has kept its armed forces so low-profile that some Hong Kong residents now want to see more of them.
The growing, if guarded, trust in the soldiers here reflects the growth of Hong Kong's confidence in China's promise to let the capitalist enclave maintain civil liberties that are unavailable on the mainland.
Nonetheless, military analysts warn that if massive social unrest were to grip Hong Kong, something hard to imagine under current conditions, the People's Liberation Army would undoubtedly act in the event that Hong Kong's 27,500 police officers could not handle the situation, or if they refused to move against the local people.
The primary role of the estimated 4,700 troops here and 5,300 across the Chinese border ``is to create a degree of good will or trust to convince Hong Kong that they have nothing to fear from the handover, that being part of China is not going to impinge on their lives,'' said Ronald Montaperto, a Chinese security specialist at National Defense University in Washington.
So far, that mission appears to have succeeded.
They are people like Leo Tang, a 17-year-old student who visited the naval barracks recently.
``We all know of Tiananmen Square, so I wondered if they would act the same way here if there were protests,'' Tang said.
``But it seems China has gone out of its way to choose a special group of soldiers here.''
According to a poll by the University of Hong Kong, as approval of the People's Liberation Army grew, satisfaction with the Hong Kong police has dropped, from 79 percent a year ago to 66 percent.
On the few occasions when demonstrators have denounced China or rallied for banned causes such as independence for Taiwan, it has been the police who have drowned out slogans with loud music or hauled protesters to the station.
In contrast, soldiers have been restricted to barracks except for rare field trips in civilian clothes.
Ironically, their absence from bars and restaurants that depended on the patronage of British troops has aroused complaints from pub owners who a year ago worried that Chinese troops might intimidate customers.
Even official business has been kept almost comically low-profile.
When the US Navy invited top Chinese officers onboard the visiting USS Blue Ridge, the Chinese were concerned about boarding the ship because they would have to walk through a busy shopping mall.
To avoid alarming civilians by marching through a public area in uniform, the Chinese asked US officials to devise a route to enter as unobtrusively as possible via a parking garage.
According to law, the People's Liberation Army can assist authorities in a crisis a natural disaster or unrest but only if requested by Hong Kong's Chief Executive and approved by Beijing.
It is hard to imagine social unrest extreme enough to destabilize Hong Kong.
But Tai Ming Cheung, a People's Liberation Army specialist, cautioned, ``If you asked me in 1988 if they'd have any reason to intervene on the mainland, I would have said no.
But in 1989, they did.''
So far, controversies involving the army here have been small-scale: a dispute over customs checks, a few traffic accidents, and a misunderstanding over nighttime firing practice in villages in rural Hong Kong.
The People's Liberation Army remains secretive, however.
It set up a telephone line for the media that goes unanswered, and it ignores interview requests.
Democratic politicians say that the army should be more open and have more contact with society because soldiers who befriend locals would hesitate to act against them.
Yet mixing with locals would be difficult on a soldier's salary of $66 a month.
That is hardly enough for dinner for two in Hong Kong.
So contact has been limited to posing with locals for pictures.
The most startling exception occurred during a bizarre Open House at the barracks on National Day, Oct. 1.
Thousands of curious locals stood in line for hours to get tickets, and the atmosphere resembled a family picnic more than a military tour.
Parents pressed babies up for photos with soldiers.
Officers sang, danced, showed how they make beds.
``Before this ... they seemed so severe and fierce.
Now I'm changing my opinion.
They're quite friendly, singing and dancing,'' said Kwok Yuk-may, a 43-year-old housewife who joined in karaoke with soldiers.
``Why should we be afraid of them?
We're all Chinese.''
