One year after saying China had improved its human rights record, the Clinton administration on Friday issued one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade.
Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton has been criticized for being too easy on the government in Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere to international human rights conventions and instead decided last fall ``to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent democratic parties.
The government also imprisoned several thousand political and religious dissidents, tortured prisoners, suppressed Chinese of minority faiths, especially Christians, and imposed new restrictions on the press, including the Internet, according to the report.
Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with China.
Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights policies provoked criticism that the administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade.
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``There is a considerable indignation about the Chinese government's renewed human rights abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to its neighbors.''
On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., asking the administration to condemn China's human rights record at an upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva.
``What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report with a strong condemnation unless commercial interests trump all other interests in this administration,'' Wellstone said.
The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that suggestion.
In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with China and suggested China was ``moving away from the rule of fear,' even though it was ``not yet rooted in the rule of law.''
Still, administration officials are worried that China is becoming a tinderbox.
``There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' said a senior official in the Clinton administration.
In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Ms. Albright would discuss the report's finding with Chinese leaders when she travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most ``robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in Chinese behavior.
``The question here is, how can developments within China, which have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform, which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed through a process of engagement?''
There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the State Department report.
China's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past, and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry farmers and create a situation beyond their control.
``They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their economic reforms,'' said a senior administration official involved in China policy.
``Their economy is flat.
Exports are flat and there is a real increase in labor unrest.
That's why the regime is very very anxious about political unrest.''
The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the economy and thereby opening up society.
``Over all, average citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than ever before: higher disposable income, looser economic controls, greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside sources of information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity in cultural life,'' it said.
But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought political freedom and that Chinese who try to dissent ``live in an environment filled with repression.''
Edward Friedman, a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin, said, ``The hard-liners in the Chinese government are increasingly in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more circumspect.''
In recent years the Chinese earned praise from the administration for signing two major international conventions on economic, cultural, civil and political rights that include guarantees of the freedom of association, speech, assembly and religion.
China's leaders have said they would respect the spirit of the law until the national legislature ratified the treaties, a promise they broke with this year's violations.
``There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of flagrantly violating their citizens' rights,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch.
The Pentagon's report to Congress on the military balance between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing's deployment of short range missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to intimidate and threaten Taiwan.
While the report said there have been no recent increases in the number of missiles targeted at Taiwan in the past year, it added that China's plans to increase its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an ``overwhelming advantage'' over Taiwan by the year 2005.
Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the overall deterioration in relations between China and the United States.
Those issues, as well as the ongoing repression in Tibet, will be discussed by Ms. Albright in China next week in preparation for the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April.
Moreover, in the coming months a series of anniversaries in China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership's tolerance of dissent.
June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and on Oct. 1 the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
``China as well as the Chinese are very anniversary conscious, and the leaders will definitely want to avoid unofficial demonstrations,'' Jendrzejczyk said.
