Several hundred disgruntled residents staged protests Wednesday in Xi'an, the Chinese city famed for its terracotta warriors that will be President Clinton's first stop in China later this month, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights group.
The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different grievances against the government began Tuesday morning.
They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow them to work as taxi drivers, the group said.
Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood.
Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at about 6 p.m. Tuesday.
They resumed their protest Wednesday morning, the human rights center said.
Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests in recent months.
The Hong Kong-based group reported last week that police in Xi'an had beaten one of the thousands of onlookers watching a sit-in on June 2 by 200 workers from the No.
