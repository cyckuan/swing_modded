New study suggests that El Nino may help slow the global warming, though it has been blamed for many climate disorders such as floods and droughts, according to a report published in the Washington Post.
The report said Richard A. Feely and his colleagues at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found that from 1991 to 1994, when El Nino was said to contribute to the warming of the Pacific, the carbon dioxide the ocean released was in fact 30 percent to 80 percent less than usual.
The study believed that because carbon dioxide is one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to the warming of the planet, the decrease of this greenhouse gas may therefore help slow the global warming.
