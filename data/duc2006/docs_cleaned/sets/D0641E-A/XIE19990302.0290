Global warming may be causing Spring to arrive a little earlier in Europe, and the fall to come later, the Washington Post said Monday.
After examing data, collected by the International Phenological Gardens, researchers at the University of Munich found, from 1959 to 1993, "Spring events," such as the emergence of leaves on trees, have moved forward by about six days, while "Autumn events," such as leaves changing color, have been delayed by 4.8 days.
Researchers said that the growing season over this period has therefore lengthened by 10.8 days on average.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
