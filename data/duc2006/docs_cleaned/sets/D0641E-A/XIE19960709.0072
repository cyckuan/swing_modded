United Nations health and environmental agencies warn that global warming due to air pollution "could have a wide range of impacts on human health."
The warning is given in a report due to be issued today when international negotiations on global warming resume in Geneva.
Scientists have become more and more concerned about the possible health consequences of global warming.
Within five years, according to the report, the warming of climate could increase substantially the proportion of the world's population living in potential malaria zones.
Heat waves triggered off by global warming have caused thousands of additional deaths each year in major cities worldwide, and would lead tens of millions of people to the risk of malaria, the report warns.
According to another report issued by the World Energy Council in London last Thursday, carbon dioxide emissions largely from burning of fossil fuels rose 12 percent between 1990 and 1995.
The New York Times today quoted the Centers for Disease Control as reporting that a heat wave killed 465 people in Chicago, the United States, alone, and in New York, where heat-related deaths now average 320 per year, three to six times that many might die annually by 2050.
