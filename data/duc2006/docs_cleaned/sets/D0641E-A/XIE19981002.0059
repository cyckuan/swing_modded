Agriculture is estimated to be responsible for eight percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming, Eurostat said on Friday.
In its first overview of the link between agriculture, global warming and climate change, Eurostat said that agriculture is the main source of methane and nitrous oxide, but total emissions of these gases are small compared to that of carbon dioxide.
However, methane and nitrous oxide are more powerful in retention of heat and thus potential causes for global warming, Eurostat said.
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European community said that one ton of methane will have the same warming effect as 56 tons of carbon dioxide over a period of 20 years.
Agriculture within the European Union contributes 41 percent of the methane emissions.
Of the agricultural total, 73 percent of the methane emissions are estimated to come from ruminants such as cattle and sheep, and 21 percent from manure.
Agriculture also contributes 41 percent of the total EU nitrous oxide emissions, compared to 33 percent from industry and 20 percent from energy.
The bulk of nitrous oxide emissions come from manure.
