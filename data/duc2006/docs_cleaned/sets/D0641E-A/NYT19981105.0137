Delegates to the summit aim to put teeth into the treaty that came out of Kyoto, which calls for the world's leading countries to sharply reduce their use of energy over the next decade and a half.
If implemented, the treaty would force the most productive societies on earth the ones that have led the way in making human life comfortable, safe, and prosperous to slow their economic growth and degrade their standard of living.
The organizers of the Buenos Aires conference take it for granted, of course, that global warming is real.
The ``consensus'' among scientists, it is said, is that the planet's temperature is rising, the cause of the rise is the use of fossil fuels, and disastrous climate changes are looming unless drastic changes are made.
The media likewise tend to take it as a given that the experts are in accord on global warming.
So do many politicians.
``The evidence of global warming keeps piling up,'' says Vice President Al Gore, who has made the issue a personal crusade, ``month after month, week after week.''
So if the scientists are all in agreement, who said this?
``We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto.
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.
``There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing (or will in the foreseeable future cause) catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.
Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.''
The carping of an oil-industry flack?
The ignorant mutterings of fringe anti-environmentalists?
No.
