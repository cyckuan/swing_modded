Sea levels would rise as the Antarctic ice sheet melted because of higher temperatures caused by global warming, Australian geologists said Wednesday.
New England University's Barrie McKelvey said a recent Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition found evidences that the ice sheet was considerably smaller during the last major period of global warming 3-8 million years ago.
He said the discovery of remnants of river and lake sediment was a major step in supporting the assertion that global warming would lead to a rise in world sea levels.
"Global warming is happening all the time," McKelvey told the Australian Associated Press in Sydney.
"But this definitely challenges the belief that the ice sheet won't be affected."
He said researchers found preserved elements of the landscape predating the Antarctic ice sheet and strata from fossil valleys created by lakes and rivers, but the materials still need to be examined.
McKelvey said the team's ultimate aim was to show the likely effect of future global warming.
"However, it is an enormous and expensive task to study a continental ice sheet that is twice as big as Australia."
The ice sheet currently contains 27 million cubic kilometers of water which, if released, would cause a 65-meter rise in world sea levels.
It would also result in climate change caused by the alteration in deep sea water currents and temperatures, and a decrease in the amount of solar heat reflected by ice into the atmosphere.
