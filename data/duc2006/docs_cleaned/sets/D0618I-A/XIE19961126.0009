The Zimbabwean government will spend 1.3 million U.S.
Dollars on insecticides this season to control the malaria-causing parasite,Zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare Secretary Paulinas Sikosana said today.
Sikosana made the statements at a meeting at which the 1996/97 malaria prevention and control campaign was launched.
He told the participants that an additional 600,000 U.S.
Dollars would be spent on anti-malarial drugs.
The money was not enough to eliminate the disease and it is up to the provincial medical officers to mobilise additional resources to support the programme in their areas, he added.
More than 6,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria this year, with most of the deaths occurring between January and May.
Sikosana said health officials should educate the community on how malaria is contracted and how it can be prevented.
The World Health Organisation resident representative Levon Arevshatian said more than 90 percent of all malaria cases in the world were in sub-Saharan Africa.
Arevshatian said 1.5 to 2.7 million people died from the disease each year, especially among children below five years.
