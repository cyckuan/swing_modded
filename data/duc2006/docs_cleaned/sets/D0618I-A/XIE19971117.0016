The World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the southern African countries will hold a consultation and planning meeting on accelerated support for malaria prevention and control in the region between November 17 to 21 in Harare.
It would also prepare annual work plans for 1998, establish systems for implementation and monitoring of integrated annual malaria work plans, develop a format for this year's annual reports and review the status and follow up on forecasting and epidemic preparedness in the region.
The development of a consensus for malaria survelliance, information systems and monitoring trends would also come under the spotlight as well as reviewing the report of the first southern Africa malaria conference and recommending strategies and methods for implementation and follow up.
At least 30 participants from Angola, Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are expected to attend the meeting.
Malaria continues to be one of the most serious public health problems and a major obstacle to social and economic development in southern Africa.
