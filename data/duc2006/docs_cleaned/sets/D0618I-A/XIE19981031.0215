The United Nations system launched a campaign here Friday to combat malaria which kills about 1 million children every year.
In his message welcoming the campaign, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the fight against malaria enables the U.N. to focus its efforts on an issue "which has caused so much suffering in Africa and other developing regions for all too long."
Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 300 million acute cases per year, with most deaths occurring among children in Africa.
Studies have found that poor health via disability from diseases such as malaria reduces incomes by as much as 12 percent in affected developing countries, according to U.N. information.
The use of simple prevention and control methods has shown starting results, the U.N. said.
For instance, in trials conducted in Gambia, Burkina Faso, Kenya and Ghana, the use of insecticide-treated bed nets was shown to effectively protect sleeping children from malarial mosquitoes, resulting in dramatic reductions in deaths.
Based on satellite mapping and climatic information, the distribution of malaria can now be determined at the community level and the information will benefit national and international efforts for malaria control.
New discoveries have led to a variety of approaches to a malaria vaccine, with many of the possibilities already undergoing human trials.
However, scientists estimate that it will take seven to 15 years before an effective malaria vaccine is ready.
