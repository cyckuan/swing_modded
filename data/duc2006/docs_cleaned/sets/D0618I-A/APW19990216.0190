Researchers have discovered a possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, which kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens an additional 300 million.
Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought the best hope was actually worthless.
The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life cycle.
But researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream.
Rabbits immunized with the new vaccine produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the researchers reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research.
The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising enough to try the vaccine in people.
