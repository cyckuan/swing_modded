Malaria hurts African economies more than has been recognized but could be better controlled for relatively little money, according to a new study to be released Tuesday.
The study, by the Harvard Center for International Development and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be presented in Nigeria at the first conference at which African heads of state will meet to discuss malaria, which kills more than 1 million people a year, most of them children.
Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies between 1965 and 1990, the study concluded that the disease cut one percentage point a year from the annual growth rates of those economies.
If malaria had been eliminated in 1965, the annual gross domestic product of Africa would now be $400 billion rather than $300 billion, the study estimated.
The study's economic models, according to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard center, took into account more than the costs of treatment and losses associated with death.
They also estimated the losses from tourists and foreign investors who avoid malaria-prone countries, the damage done by large numbers of sick children missing school and the increase in population and impoverishment when parents have extra children because they know some will die.
In most affected countries, the disease crosses class lines.
``It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor your chances of catching it are high,'' said Nils Delaire, president of the Global Health Council, a participant in the conference.
The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
The chief weapon the sponsors endorse is a simple one: bed nets treated with insecticide.
After that, they favor more spraying to kill mosquito larvae, education of rural people in the use of simple blood tests and cheap drugs to keep patients alive until they can reach doctors.
Each $8 spent on prevention adds about a year of healthy life to an African, according to Ann Mills, one of the London School analysts who worked on the study.
``World spending on malaria control and research for Africa is maybe 10 cents per case per year,'' said Sachs.
``It's quite dreadful.
World Bank lending for malaria is de minimus.
The big pharmaceutical companies see it as a disease of the very poor, so they never view it as much of an investment priority.''
Meanwhile, he said, many malaria-prone countries have per capita incomes of less than $300 and health budgets too small for ``these very reasonable interventions.''
The U.S. share of that, he said, would be 75 cents per American.
``In a world where we're enjoying riches beyond what was imagined 20 years ago, we can afford to do more than we do,'' Sachs said.
He might even, he said, dare to also suggest $1 billion for AIDS and $1 billion for tuberculosis, for a total of $2.25 per American.
``And bed nets aren't going to end up in a bank account in Switzerland.''
The Clinton administration is offering tax breaks of up to $1 billion for any company that invents a malaria vaccine, and the Gates Foundation, created by the founder of Microsoft, is investing $250 million in the research.
