Five Southern African Development Community (SADC) health ministers reached an agreement here on Saturday on coordinating their efforts to combat malaria in the region.
The ministers from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe said in a statement that an coordinated approach was essential to contain the spread of malaria.
They established a working group to investigate how to secure funds for malaria control plans and made recommendations on key areas in malaria prevention, treatment and control, according to the statement.
The working group sub-committee would report on the progress of the investigations at the annual ministers' meeting next month.
The region has been hit by a recent spate of malaria caused by floods sweeping through a number of regional countries.
