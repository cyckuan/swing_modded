Malaria is spreading quickly in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of deforestation, global warming, creation of dams, irrigation schemes and commercial tree cropping, said a fact sheet released by the World Health Organization.
Malaria affects 40 percent of the world's population in more than 90 countries while over 90 percent of the cases are in Africa where there are increasing levels of chloroquine resistance, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Sunday quoted the recently-released WHO fact sheet as saying.
Malaria kills one million people every year in the world and the vast majority of deaths occur among young children and pregnant women in Africa, said the WHO's fact sheet.
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S.
Dollars last year alone.
"In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease," it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
Drug combinations for multi-drug resistance malaria and vaccines against malaria are being developed at the global level while insecticide-treated mosqui nets and curtains have emerged in recent years as a promising tool to prevent malaria disease.
The WHO, the World Bank and other U.N. organizations this year have joined forces to launch a new campaign called "Roll Back Malaria" to fight the disease.
