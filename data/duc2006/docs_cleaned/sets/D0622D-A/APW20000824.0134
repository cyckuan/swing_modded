The number of dead birds that have tested positive for the West Nile virus has nearly doubled in a week to 322 and expanded to a 10th county, state officials said Thursday.
The number of birds testing positive for the mosquito-borne virus jumped from 165 last Thursday and includes one bird found in Mercer County, health officials said.
All are crows except one, a cockatiel.
The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties' intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
But McGowan said the numbers likely mean the virus has reached new heights in the state.
The number of affected crows in Essex County more than tripled, from 10 to 39, the department said.
Bergen County crows rose from 51 to 84, while the birds found in Union County more than doubled from 14 to 34.
Thirty-six birds were found in Hudson County, up from 18 last week, 68 were in Middlesex County, 29 in Monmouth County, 27 in Passaic, three in Morris County, one in Somerset and one in Mercer, officials said.
No humans in New Jersey have tested positive for the virus, which killed seven people and sickened scores last year in New York City.
Three Staten Island residents have tested positive for the virus this year.
The virus is carried to birds by infected mosquitoes.
It is potentially life-threatening to the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
Test results on 11 suspected cases of the virus in New Jersey are still pending, health officials said.
Four pools of mosquitoes collected in Bergen County in late July have tested positive for the virus, but none of the 10,000 mosquitoes analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, sentinel chickens or sparrows have tested positive.
State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Shinn said the increased numbers of birds will not prompt the state to begin aerial spraying.
''If counties continue their effective control strategies, using focused, intense, ground applications to further reduce the adult mosquito population on an as-needed basis, we are unlikely to need aerial spraying of urban areas,'' Shinn said.
''It gives us a better handle on the way the virus behaves naturally so that it helps us translate into what the human health risk is,'' said Steve Ostroff, the federal West Nile coordinator for the CDC.
