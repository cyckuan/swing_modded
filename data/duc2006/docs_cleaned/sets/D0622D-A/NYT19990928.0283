Some scientists are concerned birds carrying the virus may bring it farther south as they migrate to warmer climates for the winter.
Georgia public health officials say they aren't worried because the human outbreak has been confined to New York, and it's unclear whether the virus would pose a threat to Georgia.
No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus of Africa.
Humans are infected through mosquitoes that have fed from the blood of infected birds.
In addition to its human victims, the virus has felled scores of birds in New York and Connecticut mostly crows, but also a few flamingos and an Asian pheasant at the Bronx Zoo.
The ideal animal host for a virus doesn't die from carrying it, however.
The ideal host remains alive so the virus can be passed on to other species.
``Until we have some more details about what the bird is and we can look at migratory directions, all we can do is take the normal precautions that anyone can do with encephalitis,'' said Tom Bennett, an environmental health specialist with the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has sent at least six researchers to New York.
Researchers at the CDC's labs in Fort Collins, Colo., identified the virus and are conducting further studies.
``It may be some time before we know how long this virus has been around or where it came from,'' said agency spokesman Tom Skinner.
Since late August, more than three dozen people in New York City and the neighboring counties of Westchester and Nassau have been stricken with encephalitis caused by the West Nile-like virus.
Doctors are analyzing blood from another eight New Yorkers who died since August to determine whether they were killed by the same strain.
About 170 cases of illness remain under investigation.
Originally, the CDC identified the culprit as St. Louis encephalitis virus, the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis in the United States.
Late Friday, the agency changed its diagnosis to West Nile-like virus.
The immediate solution is the same in either case: Kill the mosquitoes.
``It's important to note that all the control measures in New York and surrounding states are appropriate whether St. Louis or West Nile-like virus is involved,'' Skinner said.
Georgia doesn't have statewide mosquito control measures, but many coastal counties do, Bennett said.
No human or avian cases of encephalitis have been reported this year in Georgia.
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, caused by anything from head injury to bacterial or viral infections.
Most people with encephalitis suffer flu-like symptoms, including fever and headaches.
In some cases, the infection leads to paralysis, seizures, coma and death.
Young children, the elderly and those with weak immune systems are at greatest risk.
The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda.
West Nile encephalitis has been reported in Africa, Europe and Asia.
West Nile encephalitis cannot be passed from person to person, or from birds to people; the virus must pass through a mosquito.
No vaccine exists for the virus, and treatment is limited to the symptoms of the illness.
