dead crow that had been infected with West Nile virus was found in the city, health authorities said Wednesday, confirming that the exotic encephalitis virus has migrated here and prompting officals to calmly warn the public to protect themselves against mosquitoes.
The West Nile virus is spread by mosquito bites and scientists said Wednesday they are unsure how widespread it is among Boston's mosquito population.
Birds cannot spread it to humans.
After discovering the infected crow Saturday, public health officials began testing mosquitoes to see if any were carrying the virus.
Those results are due Thursday and will determine if mosquito spraying outside the immediate Willow Pond area of Jamaica Plain, where the dead crow was discovered, is necessary.
They will also consider aerial spraying, though only if signs emerge that large numbers of mosquitoes here carry the virus.
In the meantime, officals said residents will be notified if areas around their homes are to be targeted.
They advised people to wear long clothing when outdoors and to use insect repellent liberally.
There have not been a human cases of West Nile reported in the state.
Last year the virus sickened 55 people and killed 7 in Queens, N.Y., all of them elderly.
On Monday, New York officals closed that city's massive Central Park after infected mosquitoes were found there, though no humans have tested positive.
Believed to have originated in Africa and Asia, West Nile is most likely to be fatal in the elderly, and state officials said all cautions apply doubly to them.
Infants are also at higher risk.
In most younger, healthy people the virus is typically benign.
State officals said they will aggressively test all dead animals found in the area for signs of the virus.
Hospitals will also be on the lookout for patients with West Nile-like symptoms.
Horses throughout the state will be tested.
Residents were urged to protect themselves and pets against mosquitoes, and empty any outdoor containers filled with water because mosquitoes breed around stagnant water.
``We have no idea how intense the force of transmission is locally.
It may be that we will see another Queens 1999 in Boston or that (Wednesday's findings) are the end of things,'' said Andrew Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at Harvard School of Public Health.
``We'll soon have some handle on how intense the outbreak is likely to be, or if there will be an outbreak.''
State officals have been testing dead crows regularly since the virus first appeared in New York last year.
Though it was expected more likely to turn up in southern cities, where birds migrate, officials said they weren't caught off guard by Wednesday's discovery.
``We're not surprised at all at the findings,'' said Ralph Timpari, assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Laboratory Sciences.
``It's a single bird.
It's not a time of being overly concerned.
It's an indication of how rare it is in Massachusetts.''
The West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain.
It is transmitted through mosquitoes which become infected from birds that carry the virus.
It cannot be spread by person-to-person contact, such as touching, kissing or caring for someone who is infected.
West Nile tends to produce flu-like symptoms, such as slight fevers, headaches and body aches, five to 15 days after the initial bite.
The most severe infections can cause headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, paralysis and sometimes death.
In most of the people who get the virus, it passes unnoticed.
Only a small percentage require hospitalization.
Of those, only 7 percent die.
There is no treatment and no vaccine.
Q.
What is West Nile encephalitis?
West Nile encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by West Nile virus, which is commonly found in Africa, West Asia, and the Middle East.
How long has West Nile virus been in the U.S.?
It is not known how long it has been in the U.S., but scientists believe the virus has probably been in the eastern U.S. since the early summer of 1999, possibly longer.
How do people get West Nile encephalitis?
By the bite of a mosquito that is infected with West Nile virus.
What is the basic transmission cycle?
Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds.
After an incubation period of 10 days to 2 weeks, infected mosquitoes can then transmit West Nile virus to humans and animals.
Can you get West Nile encephalitis from another person?
No.
