State health officials Friday said a dead crow found in River Edge, Bergen County tested positive for the West Nile virus.
The bird was one of 120 crows so far tested by state officials.
Results were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
''The New Jersey test shows that the surveillance system we have established to monitor West Nile virus is working as planned,'' Christine Grant, state commissioner of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.
Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant.
The virus has not been found in tests of mosquito pools in eight counties.
Last year, health workers found traces of the virus in 74 crows and two mosquito pools.
No New Jersey resident was found to carry the virus, state officials said.
Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in Westchester and sickened more than 60.
It was also blamed for hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.
West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms.
In the most serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune systems, are most at risk.
Birds harbor the disease and many are susceptible to it, but they cannot transmit it to humans.
