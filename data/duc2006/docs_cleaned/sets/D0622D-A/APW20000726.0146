Centers for Disease Control officials left New Jersey on Wednesday to await the results of tests on mosquitoes and sparrows in four northern counties that could show how far west the West Nile virus has spread.
The CDC ended a two-week research project that was centered on Bergen County, where seven dead crows have been found infected with the virus this year.
One dead crow was found in Middlesex County and another in Hudson County last week.
Chet Moore, a supervisory entomologist for the CDC, said the agency will look for signs of infected mosquitoes in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties to find out if the disease has spread to western New Jersey.
The agency is collecting samples from sparrows to find out how many antibodies birds have to defend themselves against the virus.
The CDC is testing sparrows instead of crows because crows are exceptionally sensitive to West Nile and are not a good average sample, Moore said.
Test results are expected next week on 2,000 to 3,000 mosquitoes collected in each county, and on samples from several hundred birds in each county, Moore said.
Many of the crows found in Bergen County and Rockland County, N.Y., were located along a straight line along the Hackensack River, which Moore said may or may not mean something.
Mosquitoes are known to breed in standing water.
The birds were found quite a distance offshore, he said, but ''it looks too interesting to be pure chance.''
State testing of 452 flocks of sentinel chickens and 405 mosquito-breeding areas have found no mosquitoes or chickens infected with the disease, Bergen County Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber said.
No humans have become infected.
Seven people died last year in New York, when the West Nile strain of encephalitis first surfaced in the region, sickening dozens.
Schuber lashed out Wednesday at New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who said it would be preferable if some suburban counties sprayed areas where the virus is detected more thoroughly.
Schuber said the county has spent $1.15 million on West Nile prevention efforts this year and last year lent its trucks to New York City to help spraying efforts there.
''In fact, this disease unfortunately started in the city of New York,'' Schuber said.
''Our efforts ... are not only expensive, they are expansive.''
Giuliani declined comment on Schuber's remarks through a spokeswoman.
