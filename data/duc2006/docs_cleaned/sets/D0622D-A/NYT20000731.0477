Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Monday that the city would re-spray all of Staten Island on Wednesday and Thursday with the pesticide Anvil as a ``prudent measure'' against the mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus.
Giuliani said the number of dead birds found with the virus on Staten Island 13 at last count prompted the additional spraying.
No dead birds with the virus have been found in Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn, and three have been found in Queens.
Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner who made the announcement with Giuliani, also said Monday that an increasing number of mosquitoes found in traps in Staten Island was prompting the city to act.
Cohen said that the spraying, scheduled from 10 p.m. Wednesday to 5 a.m. Thursday from trucks, was aimed at killing those mosquitoes not reached by the ground-spraying of Staten Island on July 19-20 and July 24-25.
``There's always a population of mosquitoes that have recently fed who are not in the air on any given evening,'' Cohen said.
He estimated that the initial ground-spraying of Staten Island might have missed 10 percent to 20 percent of the mosquito population.
Mosquitoes feeding on birds infected with West Nile virus become carriers of the virus, and may then infect animals the insects bite subsequently, including humans.
Last year the virus killed seven people and made 55 others ill in the New York area.
Infected birds indicate that the virus is present.
No human has been found with the virus this year.
In recent weeks, New York has sprayed pesticide throughout Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn to kill mosquitoes.
On Monday, health officials in Stamford, Conn., announced that they had found a dead crow infected with the West Nile virus, the first infected bird found in that state.
Stamford health official said that area residents had collected 200 dead birds for testing in the past week.
And in New Jersey on Monday, tests showed that six more crows found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the one found in Union County, state health officials said, bringing the total found infected so far this year in that state to 15 according to the state health department.
All counties in New Jersey spray bodies of water to kill mosquito larvae, and Sussex County has done limited ground spraying for adult mosquitoes, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the state department of environmental Protection.
