There's a place in the far southwest Phoenix area where you can see a great blue heron picking its way along the waterline, or an egret gliding overhead.
Beavers cross one trail.
Turtles and a melodious marsh wren find homes near another.
``We came here at sunset and it was like a scene from `National Geographic,' '' one visitor, Lynn Timmons, said after a look.
``It's the desert.
You don't expect to see this kind of scenery.''
Especially when it's next to a sewage treatment plant and drawing its water from the plant's discharge.
The site is Tres Rios, a 12-acre wetlands project downstream from the Phoenix area's 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
But it is more than a sanctuary for nearly 100 species of birds and wildlife from javelinas to bobcats.
It's an extension of the plant itself, using nature as a filter to provide the final cleaning stage for sewer water.
The concept could end up saving cities in the Phoenix area hundreds of millions of dollars.
The reason: Increased federal standards are expected for water being released back into the environment.
Phoenix officials say the cost to upgrade a treatment plant such as the one at 91st Avenue to meet those new standards could top $375 million.
``With a wetlands, we can do a full 800 acres for about $85 million,'' said Bing Brown, spokesman for Phoenix's Water Services Department.
``It does the same thing, and does it better in some cases.
``Do you want to put up another building, or do you want a place you can take your family to watch birds and watch lizards?
If both do about the same thing but one costs less and looks better, it seems it's a shoo-in.''
Before a city creates 800 acres of wetlands, though, it needs to know whether the concept works.
That led to Tres Rios, a demonstration project near 91st Avenue and Broadway Road.
Wastewater is processed through the nearby treatment plant and pumped into the wetlands.
As the water flows through plants and vegetation, ``nature takes its course,'' cleansing the water of nitrogen, metals, pesticides and the like.
The water is collected on the other end.
Water that comes out of the plant is not used for drinking but for irrigation and to cool towers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
Jack Landy, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco, said the EPA supports Tres Rios and is impressed with the planning going into the project.
There are other wetlands projects, including one in Show Low and a couple in Tucson, but he said there's nothing on such a large scale in this region, including Arizona, California, Nevada or Hawaii.
``We have enough experience with wetlands, though, that we're confident it can work,'' he said.
``We're going to be supportive but attentive as to the environmental impacts,'' he said.
The EPA has not identified any significant pollution from the discharge at this point, he added.
Construction of the 12-acre site began in 1995.
About $8.5 million has been spent or committed so far from the federal government and cities involved.
Tres Rios is owned by a coalition of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, Mesa and Tempe.
It is operated in partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation.
Officials of the cities say the project is more successful than they anticipated, and they are pushing to build the 800 acres of wetlands.
The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the feasibility of the larger project; the study is expected to be completed by May 2000.
The project would span an area near the Salt, Gila and Agua Fria rivers, which is how it got the name Tres Rios, Spanish for ``three rivers.''
The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas, including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would flow underground.
The lessons learned from the smaller demonstration project would help the cities operate the full-scale wetlands, says Roland Wass, research project manager at Tres Rios.
Lessons like, watch out for the beavers.
Up to a dozen now call Tres Rios home, including Brutus, who weighs an estimated 70 pounds but still is slippery enough to avoid getting caught.
He's been busy building dams and dropping a 35-foot tree in the middle of one of the ponds.
``When we started, we never anticipated beavers,'' Wass said.
``Now it's a problem, but we're learning how to deal with it.''
The most important result of Tres Rios could be improved wastewater at a fraction of the cost of what it would take to build upgraded treatment plants.
And there's the benefit that isn't financial.
``Twenty-five years down the road,'' Wass said, ``you have usable real estate, not rusting chemical tanks.''
