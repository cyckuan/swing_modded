The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry development along China's major rivers must be assessed in accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
Ecological damage has been a source of this year's floods.
Water levels on some sections of the Yangtze and at Dongting Lake have reached record highs, even though the flow was below record levels.
The State Environmental Protection Administration said in a report that serious damage to lakes, pools, and wetlands, a decline in vegetation's ecological function, and the resulting soil erosion have all contributed to the floods.
The administration is doing a more detailed study of ecological problems along China's major rivers and is trying to suggest ways of easing the problem.
