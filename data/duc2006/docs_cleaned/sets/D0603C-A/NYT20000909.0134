The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed.
The stricter rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of an acre, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, said Joseph Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of Engineers.
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River environmental organization.
``These are critical little pieces,'' he said.
``There are lots of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control.
They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking water system.''
Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.
In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal regulations, adopted last spring and tougher than previous ones will continue to apply.
