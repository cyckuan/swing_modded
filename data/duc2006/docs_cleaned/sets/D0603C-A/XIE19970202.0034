Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988.
The convention, an inter-governmental treaty launched at Ramsar, Iran, on February 2, 1971, partly aims to the conservation of wetlands as habitats for migratory water birds and enhance international cooperation in the field.
The day, adopted by a conference on wetlands held in Brisbane, Austria in March 1996 as World Wetlands Day, was marked with a theme "Wetlands and Community" in Masaka District, 120 kilometers southwest of capital Kampala today.
In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need of conservation.
The country has also developed a national wetlands policy, including the designation of Lake George's wetland, southwestern Uganda as a convention site, the research and evaluation of wetlands for facilitating their wise use.
The authorities, in February, 1996, set up a hot line for the public to report environment abuse and announced that new draining of swamps for economic development is no longer allowed in the country.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands offered Uganda funds for restoring some swamps in the country.
Uganda's wetlands cover an area of about 29,600 square kilometers and make for 12 percent of the country's territory.
The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country.
However, Uganda's wetlands has decreased in acreage, mainly due to human activities including grazing, brick-making, reduced vegetation, rice planting and hunting especially of antelopes and water birds.
Large tracts of wetlands in the country currently have been drained into paddy fields.
In Kampala and Kabale District bordering on Rwanda, many swampy areas have been drained for farming and house construction.
