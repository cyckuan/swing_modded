East China's Anhui Province is working to seek international cooperation for protecting local wetland resources, which are shrinking in size and deteriorating, a threat posed by varied human factors.
The Huaihe River and the Yangtze, the longest in China, flow through Anhui province, helping form 3.8 million ha of wetlands locally, which accounts 27.8 percent of the national total.
This means that Anhui boasts the largest area of wetlands in the country.
Wetlands have comprehensive strong points, such as nurturing water sources, storing floodwater, regulating climate, as well as disposing of sewage, along with provision of a haven for wildlife, especially endangered water fowls.
The increasing population living in valleys of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers in recent years, has accelerated the decrease and worsening of the wetlands, where a renowned home for rare and precious wildlife and plants like Chinese alligator, white dolphin, red-crowned crane, diatom and hornwort.
Though Anhui has begun to set up nature reserves for wetlands since 1982, it currently has only brought 4.6 percent of local wetlands under protection, because of technology and fund shortages.
The province intends to introduce overseas technology, facilities and money to do such research works on wetlands environment, waterfowl resources, and migratory birds.
