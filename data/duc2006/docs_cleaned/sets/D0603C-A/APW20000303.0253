After years of deliberations, the Clinton administration next week will impose tougher requirements on developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands, according to sources familiar with the new regulations.
Homebuilders said Friday the new rules are unneeded and will stall economic development, but environmentalists welcomed the tighter restrictions, saying construction under old rules led to the loss of thousands of acres of wetlands.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated internally for more than four years and were spurred by an environmental group's lawsuit.
The new requirements will take effect in June, according to the Army Corps' final draft.
The 172-page regulatory overall will require developers to seek special, individual permits to build if they want to fill in a wetland of one-half acre or more.
Prior to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1996, the cutoff was 10 acres, a standard the Army Corps later reduced to three acres.
The new regulations also will end developers' use of a streamlined ''nationwide permit'' process for most construction, meaning that specific permits will have to be approved for each project.
Homebuilders have complained that this new process will delay construction and require unnecessarily stringent review.
They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
Robert Mitchell, a Maryland builder who is president of the National Association of Home Builders, predicted ''a dramatic negative effect on the homebuilding industry'' because of delays and more stringent wetlands protection requirements.
However, the Army Corps has estimated the additional cost at closer to $26 million.
Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of disappearing wetland acres.
Although specific numbers are in dispute, environmentalists say the country, nevertheless, is losing as much as 100,000 acres of wetlands annually.
They maintain a fifth of those losses have been due to the Army Corps building permit policies.
Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called nationwide Permit 26, which applies to development, including home construction and road building, and replace it with individual permits as the Army Corps now is going to do.
David Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the nationwide permitting system amounted to giving ''rubber-stamp'' approval to construction projects.
''It has been the single largest source of permitted wetlands destruction in the country,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
But the National Association of Home Builders argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
At the same time, the group argues, the nationwide permitting system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects without environmental damage.
The average time to get an individual permit approved was more than a year, compared with about a month for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects, the group estimated.
The new reliance on individual permits, with a one-half-acre wetlands threshold, ''means more regulations, delays and costs, less flexibility'' for developers, said Mitchell.
