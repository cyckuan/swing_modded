Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first "International Wetlands' Day" designated by the international wetlands organization.
He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources.
Wetlands, a kind of important natural ecological system and known as the earth's "kidney", play an unreplaceable role in climate adjusting, water conserving, soil-erosion preventing and pollutant resolving in addition to serving as habitats for a variety of the world's rare water fowls.
China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of international importance.
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said.
Xu said his Ministry will launch a drive to enhance the awareness of wetland protection among the public, establish a dynamic monitoring network and information system for China's wetlands, conduct scientific research in wetland protection as well as proper utilization and management of wetlands resources.
Thus far, China has set up more than 130 wetland nature reserves, six of which have been listed as of "international importance", according to the minister.
