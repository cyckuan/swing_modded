The threatened red-legged frog, which is believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get extra protection from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Bowing to an order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in 31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the frog.
``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia Foulk.
The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the largest native frog in the West.
It breeds in wetlands, streams, ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70 percent.
Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult red-legged frogs.
The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal.
Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal permits usually from the Army Corps of Engineers for their projects.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has to sign off on those permits, attesting that the development will not have an adverse effect on the threatened species, as defined by the Endangered Species Act.
Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity in Berkeley, said that a major pressure point where development and the red-legged frog may collide is in Contra Costa County where several big subdivisions along Danville and Tassajara creeks are in the works.
Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it.
The agency can fine developers who knowingly trash a critical habitat, but as a practical matter, she said, mitigation measures such as altering the footprint of a development, or the land on which a building will be constructed, usually satisfy the agency's concerns.
Even though it is less of a protective measure than environmentalists would like, ``it's a positive step and might bring about the recovery of a listed species,'' Miller said.
The red-legged frog was listed as threatened in 1996 under the Endangered Species Act.
At that time, the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that designating a critical habitat was ``not prudent,'' because it would not benefit the species and might make it more vulnerable to habitat vandalism and unauthorized collection.
Alsup disagreed.
Joining the Center for Biological Diversity as a plaintiff in the complaint against the Fish and Wildlife Service were the Jumping Frog Research Institute of Calaveras County and the Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation.
