Vietnam and the World Bank (WB) signed here on Thursday two development credit agreements for Vietnam's coastal wetlands protection and development project and the rural transport project in amounts of 31.8 million U.S. dollars and 103.9 million U.S. dollars respectively.
Signatures were Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Le Duc Thuy and President of WB James Wolfensohn.
The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions.
The project also aims at improving the agricultural productivity, aquatic nurturing and other related industries of the country.
The Rural Transport Project will assist Vietnam to improve and upgrade the rural transport access network at 40 provinces and improve the access of the rural communities to the urban communities, develop the central and provincial capacity to improve and sustain the level of service of the rural transport road network.
The two credit agreements raised the total amount of the loans that WB has approved to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in the form of 25 projects and programs.
The World Bank resumed lending to Vietnam in November 1993.
This is Wolfensohn's second visit to Vietnam after the first one in May 1996, soon after he became the president of the World Bank.
The WB delegation's Asia-tour includes Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, aiming to prepare for an operation strategy for the World Bank in the 21st century.
