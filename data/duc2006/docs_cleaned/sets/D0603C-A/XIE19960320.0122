The formation of a new International conservation body announced today was vital to the wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told at the Ramsar meeting today.
The Wetlands International was launched at the Ramsar Convention conference held in Brisbane, a port city in Northeastern Australia, with the participation of some 1000 delegates from about 120 countries, The Australian Associated Press reported.
The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership between government and non-government interests to work for the goal of wetlands conservation.
Hill told the conference that relations between Wetlands International and Australia have been strengthened to the point that a formal agreement would be signed tomorrow.
Asian delegates to the international Ramsar conference called on the governing bureau to cut costs and move its headquarters out of Switzerland to the developing world.
Swami Singh Boparai, the Asian regional representative, said that as the infrastructure is available less costly in the developing world, the bureau secretariat can consider moving to a developing country so that it can have within the same budget more manpower and more activity.
Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and fauna.
Malaysia has estimated that its wetlands contributed 10 percent of its GDP although this percentage may have declined slightly as industrialization increased, he said.
The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the administrative bureau based in Switzerland.
Previous Ramsar conferences have been held in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland and Japan.
The vital importance of wetlands to Asia has led India to bid to host the next Ramsar meeting in New Delhi in 1999.
