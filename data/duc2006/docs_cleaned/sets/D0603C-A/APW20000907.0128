The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project.
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
Thursday's action by its New York district suspends some of the permit procedures that are in effect elsewhere in the country.
The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as well as parts of the northern suburbs.
The new rules also apply to the Great Swamp in Putnam and Dutchess counties, some Hudson River wetlands and other New York waters, he said.
''This will affect projects that are having anything more than an extremely minimal impact on wetlands and watercourses,'' he said.
The new rules require: -Public notice and public comment before a permit is granted.
-An analysis of whether there are less environmentally damaging alternatives.
-Mitigation of any impact on wetlands by creating or enhancing other wetlands.
''It does not mean people will not be able to develop, but it does mean that folks will have to come in, get an individual permit, give the corps the opportunity to coordinate with the city, the state, federal agencies and the general public on whether there is a reason not to authorize that project,'' Seebode said.
''We are interested in using our regulatory responsibility and authority to minimize the impact on wetlands in the watershed because they are so important in filtering out pollutants and purifying water and trapping sediments.''
