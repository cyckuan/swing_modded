Russia will hire a Norwegian company to help retrieve the remains of 118 sailors from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a top government official said Wednesday.
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is overseeing the salvage mission, told lawmakers that a contract would be initialed Saturday with a Norwegian company.
He did not name the company.
Klebanov said the retrieval work would begin before Oct. 10, and could be finished next month.
But he cautioned that the operation would be complex ''because sections one through five (of the submarine) are just heaps of metal,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
While Klebanov wouldn't name the company that will help Russia do the work, he said it was not Norway's Stolt Offshore.
According to the newspaper Kommersant, Stolt Offshore wanted $12 million but Russia offered $9 million.
Russian divers don't have the equipment or the training to conduct the operation alone.
The Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank in the Barents Sea during exercises Aug. 12.
The cause of the accident has not been determined.
The Russian ship Mstislav Keldysh arrived at the scene of the disaster on Tuesday, carrying Mir deep water capsules to examine the submarine.
The capsules have been used previously to inspect the Titanic.
