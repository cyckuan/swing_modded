Russian nuclear submarine that was stranded on the bottom of Barents Sea may have become partly filled with water, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
The multipurpose "Kursk," which was on a training mission as part of Russian Northern Fleet's regular exercises, failed to respond to radio signals at a predetermined time.
Communications with crew members were re-established later, Interfax said, quoting the Russian Navy press service.
The submarine's atomic power plant has been taken off line and is under control with radiation at normal levels, the press service said.
According to the independent NTV channel, there are no lights aboard the submarine and there could be problems with air supply following the shutdown of the nuclear power reactors.
"Kursk" remains on the Barents Sea floor, where the sea is about 100 meters deep.
Three submarines and five submersible attack vessels have come to its rescue.
Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov is overseeing the rescue operation, which is aimed at raising the submarine to the surface and evacuating its crew.
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
It has a displacement of 14,700 - 23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up to 500 meters.
The submarine is armed with torpedoes and " Granite" cruise missiles.
It can operate autonomously for up to 120 days and carries a 107-man crew, Interfax said.
The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet, Russian media reported.
The maneuvers, which involved 20 warships, submarines and auxiliary vessels and 10 coast units, were scheduled to end on Sunday.
