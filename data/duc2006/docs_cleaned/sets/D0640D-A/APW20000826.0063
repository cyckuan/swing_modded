With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the breeze, the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea, a symbol of Russian power and pride.
It was the last time anyone on land would see the nuclear-powered warship that the Russian navy boasted was unsinkable.
As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days.
The Kursk was named after the region in southern Russia where Soviet troops in 1943 turned the tide against Nazi Germany's army in the biggest tank battle in history.
Like the old land battle, the Kursk was intended to turn the tide at sea if there was ever another world war.
The submarine was a 500-foot-long underwater missile base.
Its sides bristled with 24 silos, each housing a cruise missile capable of slamming a nuclear warhead at supersonic speed into a target hundreds of miles away.
The submarine and a dozen like it were designed during the Cold War to destroy the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers with swarms of missiles.
The Cold War ended a decade ago and the Kursk's nuclear warheads were locked up ashore.
The Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia was falling apart, sinking deeper into poverty and backwardness.
The Kursk was just five years old.
The crew, nearly half of them officers with advanced technical skills, had been hailed as the navy's elite, a chosen few who could handle any challenge.
President Vladimir Putin had big plans for the navy and the Kursk.
The navy exercises that the Kursk sailed to join on Aug. 10 were a prelude for a major step in putting Moscow back on the world stage: the return of a Russian fleet to the Mediterranean in 2001 for the first time in a decade.
The exercises were big news.
Russian television showed film of the Northern Fleet in action, the hulking cruisers and nimble destroyers cutting through the waves and warships firing missiles.
Then on Aug. 14, a Monday, the navy announced that the Kursk had experienced a malfunction.
Mounting evidence suggests the crewmen were already dead and almost every utterance by top officials about saving the Kursk would turn out to be untrue.
The Kursk was rising to the surface, possibly preparing to fire a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck.
Nothing is known about what the crew was doing in those last few moments.
Norwegian monitors later reported detecting an explosion in the vicinity of the Kursk, followed within minutes by a much larger blast that registered at 3.5 on seismic monitors, equivalent to a small earthquake.
All the signs suggest a problem in the torpedo compartment at the front of the Kursk.
The submarine was carrying a new type of torpedo with a liquid fuel system that some officers complained was unstable, according to some reports.
Or the young, inexperienced conscript sailors may have fumbled one of the torpedoes or the test firing may have gone wrong, the weapon jamming in a torpedo tube.
The first blast must have convulsed the Kursk, knocking out control systems and pitching it into a sharp dive toward the bottom 350 feet below the waves.
Crewmen would have been knocked sprawling as the submarine plunged out of control.
Officers in the command center would have been shouting for reports, trying to determine what had happened.
Maybe there was time to hit the alarm system, but the whole crew already knew they were in serious trouble.
The first blast probably killed and injured some of the sailors.
Survivors would have been shouting for help, for first aid crews, frantically trying to reach injured comrades.
Plunging down at mounting speed and with the decks slanting sharply forward, sailors would have been fighting to stay on their feet or in their seats as the Kursk plunged into the depths.
They never regained control.
This blast was probably torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating.
Russia's navy says it was about 2 tons of explosives going up; some officers say it could have been more than 10 tons.
The hull was twisted like a wet towel being squeezed dry.
The Kursk was built of immensely strong steel to withstand the enormous pressures of diving hundreds of feet.
The hull would have contained and intensified the explosion.
Following the path of least resistance, the blast ripped backward, breaking through the thinner walls of the crew compartments.
Most of the crew were within yards of the blast.
Navy officers say that many were probably vaporized by the detonation; others were ripped to bits.
Anybody still alive after the second explosion was almost certainly stunned, probably deafened and unconscious.
Kursk's nuclear reactors appear to have shut down, plunging the submarine into darkness.
The explosions ripped at least one large hole in the hull.
Tons of water surged in, quickly filling the submarine.
Anyone who survived the explosions almost certainly drowned, the navy says.
There may never be an exact reconstruction of the last moments of the Kursk.
It did not have black boxes like those which can tell what happened to a crashed airliner.
Raising the Kursk may be impossible, meaning that its secrets will be lost forever.
