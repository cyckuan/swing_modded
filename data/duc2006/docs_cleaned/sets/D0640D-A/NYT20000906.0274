President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, has provided his Russian counterpart with a written summary of what U.S. naval and intelligence officials believe caused the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk to sink last month in the Barents Sea, officials said Wednesday.
The summary, based on acoustic recordings and other information gathered by two U.S. submarines and a surface vessel in the Barents at the time, included evidence that U.S. officials have said contradicts assertions by some Russian officials that the Kursk sank after a collision with another submarine or a World War II-era mine.
Berger provided the information, at the Russians' request, in a meeting on Monday with Sergei Ivanov, head of the Russian Security Council and a close aide to President Vladimir Putin.
The information could help Putin's government sort out which of several accounts was the most likely explanation for the sinking on Aug. 12 that killed all 118 crew members.
``In response to a request from the Russian government, Mr. Berger provided some information to Mr. Ivanov on our knowledge regarding the tragedy,'' said P.J.
Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
Clinton opened his meeting with Putin on Wednesday in New York with a discussion of the Kursk's sinking.
The presidents were at the world leaders' meeting at the United Nations.
``President Clinton expressed his regret and his sympathies to the families, of course,'' said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott afterward.
``And President Putin talked a bit about the episode itself and what it revealed and how he had coped with it.
There was some further discussion on that.''
The decision to share information on the Kursk was unusual, given the fact that it was gathered by one of the most secretive parts of the U.S. military, the submarine fleet.
Crowley declined to discuss what information was shared, except to say that it was in an unclassified form.
But Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, quoted Ivanov as saying the information included technical details on ``the exact times, to the second, of two explosions'' that wracked the Kursk.
Following that theory, a rocket-propelled torpedo being loaded or launched as part of an exercise misfired, with its engine or its fuel exploding.
Two minutes and 15 seconds later, a larger explosion of the torpedo warhead tore a gaping hole in the sub's bow.
