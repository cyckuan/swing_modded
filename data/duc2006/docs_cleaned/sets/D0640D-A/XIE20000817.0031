Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the incident, told reporters that the disaster with the sub "was developing two minutes," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up to 500 meters.
The submarine is armed with torpedoes and " Granite" cruise missiles.
The vessel can operate autonomously for up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported.
All efforts to evacuate the 118 submariners aboard the ill- fated Kursk have so far bore no result, but the rescue operation is continuing with 22 surface ships at the site of the accident.
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be trying to conserve oxygen and strength.
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities oxygen could last until next week.
In live footage from the scene, the RTR television showed improved weather and calmer sea, but the underwater currents remain very strong, which, coupled with near-zero visibility, has hampered the rescue vessels' repeated attempts to dock with sub.
Authorities said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down.
Radiation levels are also normal.
Kursk was participating in exercises of the Russian Northern Fleet when disaster struck, reportedly on Saturday.
Earlier Thursday, Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dyagalo as saying that the sub is slowly sinking deeper into the seabed, although the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules are trying to attach, remain accessible.
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Navy press service said.
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and Norway in the rescue bid.
It had earlier refrained from seeking outside assistance.
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
Klebanov did not specify what kind of object that submarine had hit, but Eduard Baltin, an ex-commander of the Black Sea Fleet, speculated Wednesday that the Kursk must have collided with a surface vessel.
Baltin said that the Kursk submarine must have been rising to a periscopic level at between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. Moscow time (0700 and 0745 GMT) on Saturday.
"The Kursk is an ocean submarine, whose systems function perfectly at great depths.
But at a depth of 100 meters, the submarine's hydro-acoustic system may have failed to spot an approaching surface ship," Baltin said.
