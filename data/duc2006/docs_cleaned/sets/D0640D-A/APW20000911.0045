top Russian official on Monday denied reports that the nation's security service was investigating last month's sinking of a nuclear submarine and had presented its findings to President Vladimir Putin.
First Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the head of a government commission investigating the Aug. 12 disaster, also reiterated Russia's denials that the Kursk was sunk by a missile fired by a Russian ship.
The Federal Security Service, the Russian navy and Klebanov's commission had already rejected a German newspaper report Friday that the Kursk was hit by a new anti-submarine missile fired by a nuclear-powered cruiser, the Peter the Great.
The ship's commander also denied it.
Klebanov also denied reports the Federal Security Service, the FSB, had given Putin secret documents relating to the disaster, and that the secret service had begun its own inquiry, the Interfax news agency reported.
An FSB spokesman refused to comment on the report Monday, referring callers to a secret service statement last week that denied the Kursk was sunk by a Russian torpedo.
Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine.
All 118 officers and sailors aboard were killed.
Sergei Ushakov, an aide to Russia's chief military prosecutor, said Monday it was clear another vessel had caused the tragedy.
Investigators have ''enough data that the collision with the Kursk submarine was the blame of those officials who navigated an unidentified marine craft,'' he was quoted as saying.
The investigation ''in no way blames the Kursk crew,'' he added.
