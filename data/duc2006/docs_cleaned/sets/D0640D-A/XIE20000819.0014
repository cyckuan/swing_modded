British rescuers arrived Saturday evening in the area where a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 crew went down a week ago, but Russian officials say chances are very slim now for the survival of those aboard the ill-fated Kursk.
The British rescuers arrived aboard the Norwegian ship Normand Pioneer, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
All previous attempts by Russian rescuers have failed.
Britain's LR-5 mini-submarine will take British and Russian rescuers shortly to the bottom of the Barents Sea where the cripple Kursk is lying.
The Russian Northern Fleet command said Saturday that the submarine's ninth compartment, which is connected to the emergency escape hatch, may be flooded.
That statement implies that there is little chance to save any of the submariners aboard.
Vladimir Navrotsky, head of the Northern Fleet's press service, said special rescue devices in the ninth compartment had been damaged.
There is still no final word on what caused the accident, but Admiral Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said there were two possible versions.
The first is a powerful dynamic blow that may have occurred on collision with another object.
The second is an explosion inside the submarine with subsequent flooding of the sub's first and second compartments.
The third possible cause is that the Kursk hit a World War II mine, the admiral said.
The final suggestion should not be completely discarded since six such mines have been discovered in that part of the Barents Sea over the last few years, he added.
Motsak said earlier Saturday that "we have crossed the critical guaranteed life support limit that we had set for the personnel in the guidance manuals."
"No matter how hard it is to say, we have to state the worst expectations."
