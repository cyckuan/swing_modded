Chanted slogans flowed, cheers rose, fleur-de-lis flags flapped everywhere.
Although the gathering was just another campaign rally as Quebec roars toward tomorrow's election showdown between separatists and federalists, it seemed more like old home day for the secessionist cause.
Video screens played and replayed images of the triumphs of the Parti Quebecois, which in the three decades since its founding by the late Rene Levesque has grown from a fringe movement to Quebec's most powerful political party.
Levesque's widow was on hand.
So was a living legend, poet-songwriter Gilles Vigneault the Woody Guthrie of Quebec nationalism whose daughter, Jessica, gave quavering voice to a song with the refrain, ``Tomorrow belongs to us.''
And the crowd roared back, ``We want a country!''
At the center of it all was Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's 59-year-old premier.
He is a passionate articulator of the separatist vision, and the bete noire of English Canada, vowing that the province that already considers itself a nation in spirit will soon become a nation in fact.
Perhaps very soon.
``We are a people, and a people has the right to be a country,'' he said.
``Give me the mandate so that, finally, we can say `Yes' to ourselves once and for all.''
Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
Going head-to-head in the race are Bouchard and the Liberal Party challenger, Jean Charest, 40, the only federalist champion given any chance of unseating the separatists.
But to the shock of Canadians, who only a few weeks ago were gleefully predicting a rout of the secessionist government in Quebec City, Charest has failed to catch fire with voters.
The waning hours of the campaign are looking more like a cakewalk for the separatists.
Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
Should the separatists win, as the latest polls suggest, Canada's future as an intact nation will be cast into doubt as Bouchard presses Quebec toward what he calls its ``natural destiny.''
Still, Quebec is notorious for last-minute shifts in the political wind.
If the federalists somehow snatch victory against all odds, Bouchard will almost certainly resign from politics.
With no other separatist leader in sight capable of matching his popularity, the dream of Quebec independence would be smashed, perhaps forever.
That is an outcome that the rest of Canada fervently desires.
Polls showed a dead heat only a few months ago when Charest, cast as a white knight riding to the rescue of embattled federalism, yielded to an unprecedented draft movement, quitting a safe seat in national Parliament to return to his native Quebec to do battle.
Poll after poll found Charest to be the only politician capable of beating Bouchard.
The timing seemed perfect.
For the same polls also showed Quebecers wearying of the ``neverendum referendum,'' as Montreal humorist Josh Freed has dubbed the seemingly endless quest for nationhood.
From the start, Charest hammered the theme of Quebec uselessly dissipating its energies on an impossible scheme.
He rhetorically asked audiences the question that seems to mystify everyone except Quebecers: Why should this bountiful province seek to quit one of the world's most prosperous, successful democracies?
``How long must Quebecers keep pulling this ball and chain?''
``We must end a political debate that perpetuates uncertainty, which will be paid for by our children.''
But Quebecers, or at least French Quebecers, responded with a yawn.
Despite Charest's charisma and eloquence, the federalist crusade has fizzled in large part because the native son, upon returning home, strikes many Quebecers as a stranger.
Or, worse, just a front man for English Canada.
``All the cheering from the rest of Canada when Mr. Charest went to Quebec did him no good in the province,'' observed Jeffrey Simpson, national affairs columnist for the Globe and Mail, a nationally circulated newspaper.
Indeed, Bouchard won points simply by mocking Charest's notion of Quebec comfortably cradled in the arms of Canada: ``Jean Charest is a man who denies Quebec as it is, in its profound identity.
Quebec will never resign itself to being a province like the others.''
Charest made a dangerous decision by portraying himself as a political outsider in a province that fears the outside above all else.
The entire history of Quebec might be told as a desperate struggle for the survival of its unique, French-rooted culture against English North America.
After years in Ottawa, preoccupied with national politics, Charest seems to have forgotten that even Quebecers opposed to secession don't carry much love for Canada in their hearts.
``Myself, I am not truly a separatist, but I will vote Parti Quebecois because I trust Mr. Bouchard to look after the interests of Quebec first and foremost,'' said Marc Trudel, 43, a Quebec City schoolteacher.
``Mr. Charest seems too comfortable with Canada.
We can never trust the English provinces.''
Polls consistently show that Quebecers are sick of referendums on independence.
And to the rest of Canada, and Charest's supporters in Quebec, secession is such a soul-searing issue that it was assumed that weariness with referendums must necessarily translate into a big vote for the federalists.
But to French Quebecers, separatism is one issue among many.
Even those who think secession is a bad idea will support the Parti Quebecois if the party seems to serve the greater good of the province.
And the fact is, Bouchard has done a topnotch job of running Quebec unemployment is down, exports to the United States are up, government spending has been curtailed, and Montreal is rocketing back as one of the most dynamic cities in Canada.
``Generally speaking, people feel better economically,'' said Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Leger Leger.
Surveys released last week show that Quebecers believe Bouchard is honest, dedicated, hard-working, and, perhaps above all, the one politician capable of forcing Canada to show respect for its most willful and wayward province.
Meanwhile, Charest's federalist campaign was undercut from the start by comments from Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who told a Quebec newspaper, La Presse, that Canada would not seek changes in federal law to give Quebec special political powers and protections.
Charest is likely to score an impressive victory in Montreal, with its cosmopolitan population of English Quebecers, Jews, and ethnic voters such as Chinese and East Indians who loathe the French language laws of the separatist government nearly as much as they despise the secessionist impulse.
Similarly, Bouchard is sure to win big in the separatist heartland north of Quebec City.
The real battle for Quebec is being fought in the St. Lawrence River valley between Montreal and the provincial capital, in faded centers such as Trois Rivieres, Longueuil, and Cap-de-la-Madeline.
And on this vital front, things look bleak for Charest.
``To me, it's not about separation but standing tall against Canada,'' said Valerie Corbeil, a 34-year-old beautician in gritty Trois-Rivieres.
``Mr. Charest seems a nice man.
But I fear he would let Quebecers become like Cajuns in Louisiana colorful characters with bad French and no power.''
An impressive separatist win would make it a near certainty that Bouchard will launch another referendum on independence, possibly as early as next year.
He has pledged to put the issue before Quebecers again only in the event of ``winning conditions,'' by which he apparently means a Quebec that is economically sound enough to weather breaking away from Canada.
The election is being closely followed not only in Ottawa but Washington, Paris, London, and other capitals, although many Americans seem generally oblivious to the political drama unfurling north of New England.
``Americans tend to think the absence of bombs and bullets means no crisis,'' said one Canada-based foreign diplomat.
``But Canada is drifting toward a very serious situation.
The federal government has basically lost ability to influence events in Quebec.''
Earlier this year, in a landmark Canadian Supreme Court case that backfired badly on the federal government, the nation's nine high judges ruled that Canada cannot prevent the secession of Quebec if a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers opt for independence.
``We have won so many battles,'' Bouchard told a cheering audience last week.
``We have only one more to win.
Let's win it and give to our children a Quebec that is fully responsible for its own destiny.''
