Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters gave their combative politicians a split decision: the pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon.
The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125 seats to earn a new term of up to five years.
But the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning only 48 seats, received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43 percent for the Parti Quebecois.
As a result, Liberal leader Jean Charest sounded more buoyant in his remarks to supporters than Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatist leader, did in his victory speech.
``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition leader in the provincial legislature.
The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of political support in Quebec.
Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts, mostly around multiethnic Montreal, where the Liberals can rack up huge victory margins.
The separatists, whose backing comes almost entirely from Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in a much larger number of districts spread across the province.
Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would if returned to power call for a referendum on seceding from Canada whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory.
But with only 43-percent support for his party, Bouchard is likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence.
``There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a government, not a vote to determine the future of Quebec or the future of the country,'' said Brian Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland.
Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and pledged to work with them on policy matters.
But he also promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence possible eventually.
``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther toward its destiny,'' he said.
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin reaffirmed U.S. support for an undivided Canada.
``The United States recognizes this is an internal issue for Canadians to resolve within their constitutional, legal and political system,'' he said.
``We have always valued our close and productive relationship with a strong and united Canada.''
Canada's federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day campaign, not wanting to undercut Charest in a province where many francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in helping strengthen Quebec's economy and social services.
``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country,'' Chretien said.
As a personality, the charismatic Bouchard is by far the most popular politician in Quebec.
But many Quebeckers who voted for his party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 70 percent didn't want another referendum.
One of the most notable results of the election was the strong showing of Democratic Action, the No.
