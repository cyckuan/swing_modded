``Negotiations following such a referendum would undoubtedly be difficult.
While negotiators would have to contemplate the possibility of secession, there would be no absolute entitlement to it and no assumption that an agreement reconciling all relevant rights and obligations would actually be reached.
``It is foreseeable that even negotiations carried out in conformity with the underlying constitutional principles could reach an impasse.
We need not speculate here as to what would then transpire,'' the opinion said.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
But federal officials, shaken by the near victory of the separatists in the October 1995 referendum on separation, had decided it was far more risky to just sit back and do nothing.
Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
In the October 1995 referendum, Quebec's vote in favor of separation had increased to just over 49 percent.
Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy.
According to published reports, separatist leaders planned to declare independence and gain recognition of the new country from France and the United States within days after the 1995 referendum if they had won, despite promises of a period of negotiation with the rest of Canada.
American officials have said it is unlikely the United States would have recognized an independent Quebec that seceded without the consent of the rest of Canada.
The Ottawa government decided in 1996 to join a suit filed by a federalist in Quebec asking the Supreme Court for an opinion on the constitutional legality of a unilateral Quebec secession.
Such opinions are called references and while not legally binding, they are important because of the moral and legal authority of the court.
The Supreme Court has issued 74 references since 1892.
The court limited its opinion strictly to the questions asked by the federal government and did not touch several other sensitive issues.
For example, it left up to politicians to decide whether ``a clear majority'' meant 51 percent of votes cast or some more rigorous standard.
The court also avoided the question of whether a Quebec that decides to leave Canada could then be partitioned because northern Indian tribes, like the Cree, have said firmly that they want to remain in Canada.
