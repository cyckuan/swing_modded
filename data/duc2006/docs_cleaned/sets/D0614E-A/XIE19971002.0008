majority of Canadians support the new national unity initiative proposed in Calgary last month, according to a new poll published today.
However, they don't think the Calgary accord will make much difference in terms of keeping the French-speaking Province of Quebec in Canada.
The accord, reached last month in Calgary by all provincial premiers, excluding Quebec premier, and two territorial leaders, affirmed Quebec's "unique character" while stressing the principles of equality of all Canadians and provinces.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
The poll showed that 70 percent of those surveyed regard the accord as a step in the right direction, while 24 percent say it was a mistake for the premiers to reopen the national unity issue.
In Quebec, 62 percent of respondents say the accord is a right step, while 32 percent regard it as a mistake.
Meanwhile, 57 percent of Canadians think the efforts by the premiers, backed by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, will have no real impact on the possibility of Quebec's stay or separation.
Within Quebec, a slim majority say the accord does not alter their view on the province's future course.
Chretien, a French-speaking Quebecker who has worked tirelessly to keep Canada united, said the premiers demonstrated responsible leadership.
The poll by Angus Reid Group is the first national poll on attitudes toward the Calgary accord.
The survey of 1,500 Canadians was taken on September 23-30 and is considered accurate within 2.5 percentage points.
