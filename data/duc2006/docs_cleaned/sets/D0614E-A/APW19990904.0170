The land known as Acadia disappeared from maps nearly 300 years ago, when the French colonial settlement was lost to the British after years of war for what are now Canada's maritime provinces.
But Acadians and their culture are alive and well in French-speaking New Brunswick, perfectly happy to remain part of Canada and deeply distrustful of the independence aspirations of their fellow Francophones in nearby Quebec.
``We can live together in harmony.
We're a good example to Quebec,'' said Roger Gaudet, a father of four who can trace his family history back to an original French settlement in Nova Scotia.
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland - worry most that an independent Quebec will only make it harder for them to preserve the French culture they have fought for 300 years to retain.
``The balance of power between Anglos and Francophones rests on a strong Quebec presence at the federal level,'' said Maurice Basque, director of Acadian studies at the University of Moncton, the largest Francophone university in the region.
``Without Quebec, the question will become: `Will Canada remain bilingual?'''
Quebec's sovereignty has been put on the back page for the time being, after voters rejected sovereignty in successive referendums in recent years.
Secessionists are vowing to try again in a few years.
``The fact that Quebec will be a French country in association with Canada would be a plus for them in all sorts of ways,'' she said.
Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said.
Many resettled in Louisiana, where they are now called Cajuns, but others returned to the provinces to reclaim the land of their ancestors and rekindle their French identity with Canada's blessing.
On Saturday, French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute to their courage, telling a crowd of several hundred people how honored he was to be among so many people loyal to France.
That recognition is enough to keep Acadians content with the status quo, said Acadian student Eric Larocque.
``Acadia was erased from the maps in the 1700s,'' he said.
``It doesn't exist but in the hearts of those who fought to save our language and culture.''
