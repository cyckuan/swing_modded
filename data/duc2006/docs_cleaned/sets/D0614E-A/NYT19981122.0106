Both men left the confines of Quebec for federal politics years ago.
Both served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Both later switched parties and both have come home to fight for the future of Canada's French-speaking province.
But whatever similarities once existed between them have faded.
Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, and Jean Charest, the leader of the province's Liberal Party, are now locked in a do-or-die election that on Nov. 30 will decide, to a large extent, whether Quebec's long flirtation with secession will succeed at last.
Bouchard has promised that if his Parti Quebecois is re-elected he will hold a third referendum on separation, probably by 2001.
The last referendum, in 1995, fell just 50,000 votes short of authorizing Quebec to negotiate its way out of Canada.
Charest says there will be no referendum if he is premier.
Many political analysts say that could take away the separatists' last opportunity to win, because passion for independence is waning.
The continuing exodus of English speakers is largely offset by the declining local birth rate, and the large influx of immigrants tends to vote against secession.
``If Quebec hasn't solved this problem'' in the next few years, said Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer for La Presse, a Montreal daily newspaper, ``completely different rules will apply.''
Bouchard, 59, is a passionate separatist.
He is a sometimes hotheaded francophone as independent as is Jonquiere, the rugged area on the fierce Saguenay River that Quebecers proudly consider their frontier.
It is a place of oversized dimensions of huge aluminum smelters, prodigious paper mills and uncontainable ambition for Quebec independence all reflected in the fiery character of Bouchard.
He is determined to carry Quebec to what he sees as its destiny as an independent, French-speaking nation in North America.
Charest, 40, is a curly-haired federalist who is as comfortably bilingual as is Sherbrooke, his home in the Eastern Townships near the Vermont-New Hampshire border.
It is a place where English- and French-speaking families have long lived side by side, a place so accommodating that English street signs include French footnotes, like Rue Wellington, ``General Britannique, 1769-1852.''
Charest was leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party before being drafted by supporters to take on Bouchard and vanquish the separatist threat.
He has staked his promising political career on the crusade to keep Quebec in Canada.
If Quebec were to vote for secession, a complicated series of negotiations would follow to settle such questions as the province's share of the national debt and compensation for federal properties.
There would also be a bitter fight over what to do with areas of the province that do not want to leave Canada, particularly northern lands that are home to Cree Indians who have voted overwhelmingly against separation.
So far opinion polls have the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois running just about even, with the separatists recently pulling slightly ahead.
Under Quebec's parliamentary system, Bouchard and Charest run in their local districts, but as party leader either automatically becomes premier if his party gains a majority.
English-speaking Quebecers are bunched in Montreal and the Eastern Townships.
If current trends continue, the Liberals will not win the majority of legislative seats that they need to form the next government.
Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger Leger, a Montreal polling company, said a Charest victory would turn demographics against the separatists.
But he expects Bouchard to win, and he said the margin of victory would affect the timetable for a referendum.
``If Bouchard gets 45, 46 percent of the vote, I'm not sure he would try a referendum,'' Leger said.
``But if he gets 48, 49 percent, he would hold one for sure.
If he gets more than 50 percent, and it's possible, he will have a referendum within six months.''
Charest concedes nothing.
``This is a campaign, period,'' he said.
``We're in a battle, period.
And in the best sense of the word, it's democracy at work, and we are going to win.''
Bouchard, bolstered by the polls, has assumed an air of confidence.
``The only true solution for Quebec,'' he said, ``is Quebec sovereignty.''
They came from opposite ends of Quebec, where history has shaped destiny and character is formed by memory.
The Saguenay region where Bouchard was reared is in the distant northern hills.
Bouchard, who until he was 46 never saw any other part of Canada except the next-door province of Ontario, is typical of many people here for whom Quebec is already a nation.
``There is an excess of pride in this area, and it's a mixed blessing,'' said Rejeanne Gilbert of Jonquiere, who was having her hair styled at the Coiffures Signature salon on Rue St. Dominique, which is awash with small shops and countless beauty parlors.
``That pride is why we have the kind of politics we have here, and why there are so many hairdressers.''
Jonquiere is an unassuming town of 56,000, with an average income of $15,300 and 11.7 percent unemployment, higher than the 8.3 percent national average.
Like Mrs. Gilbert, most here speak only French.
People are used to good jobs in big companies like Alcan Aluminum, which receives subsidized electricity from Quebec's hydroelectric plants.
Lynda Dufour, owner of Coiffures Signature, called the Saguenay socially and culturally cut off not just from the rest of Canada, but also the rest of Quebec.
``If you come from the Saguenay, people in the rest of Quebec think you are from so far away that you still have feathers on your head,'' she said.
This is often called the cradle of the separatist movement, which emerged in the 1960s.
``We here have to fight a little harder than those elsewhere to succeed,'' said Marc Andre Bedard, a minister in the government of the province's first separatist premier, Rene Levesque.
``Mr. Bouchard is very much a son of the area, a man of strong roots, conviction and determination.''
Bouchard, who speaks English with a French accent and is married to an American, is also the leader of a government that has had to reduce a crushing deficit by cutting education and health services that Quebecers take for granted.
He has closed many hospitals, and services at the one in Jonquiere were scheduled to be severely cut back.
But when he returned to Jonquiere earlier this month for his formal nomination, doctors threatened to resign if the cuts went through.
Bouchard offered them enough money to call off the threat, but that angered other communities that saw it as favoritism.
There have been other embarrassing moments for Bouchard, including the disclosure of a study showing that government cuts had caused poor and mentally ill patients to go without medication.
So far, though, the revelations do not seem to have hurt Bouchard.
He is the most popular and respected politician in French-speaking Quebec.
In 1994 he was hospitalized with a flesh-eating infection, to which he eventually lost a leg.
He came out of the hospital to lead separatist forces in the 1995 referendum, and when the premier at the time resigned, he took over.
``Bouchard is a man of pride and honor,'' said Mario Arcette, 21, a nurse in Jonquiere.
``And he wants Quebec to be like himself, proud and honorable.''
Pride and honor persist in the Eastern Townships as well, but it is the pride of coexistence and the honor of accepting differences.
The area was settled by Loyalist families who fled the United States during and after the Revolutionary War.
They were encouraged to live where they could most easily defend Canada from invasion.
Though not without some tensions, English and French have long lived side by side.
Many people in Sherbrooke are fluently bilingual, like Nicole Girard.
``If you are bilingual you tend not to be as extreme,'' she said one morning at a local cafe.
``You don't have as much prejudice, and you can understand the other side a little better.''
Sherbrooke is the biggest city in the Eastern Townships, so named because they lie east of the St. Lawrence River.
It is a city of 76,700 residents, with an average income of $14,400 and 11 percent unemployment.
Separatists do not find much support here.
``They want to be separatist so nobody makes them do anything,'' said Lina Jacques of nearby Lennoxville.
``But Quebec is too small to just think, `I'm going to live in this province and nowhere else.'''
Charest's own family is a model of coexistence, with an Irish mother and a French-speaking father who was a local businessman and political leader.
The candidate married a local girl and is fluent in French and English.
``If you live here you believe the two communities can live together with respect and humanity,'' said Paul Milliard, assistant director of the local Charest campaign.
``And Jean Charest is proof of that.''
Charest and Bouchard are known to dislike each other, a disaffection that dates back to their days together in the Mulroney Cabinet.
In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
Bouchard has responded with a politically ambiguous promise to hold another referendum the priority issue in his party's platform only when winning conditions exist.
That essentially allows him to keep the separation option open.
Charest has alienated some Quebecers by ruling out a referendum entirely, thus surrendering Quebec's leverage with Ottawa.
And the Parti Quebcois continues to portray him as an outsider from Ottawa.
In the campaign's only debate, on Tuesday night, Charest testily defended his credentials as a local boy.
Quebecer from Sherbrooke is no less a Quebecer than someone from Jonquiere,'' he said.
While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, even the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has gone out of the secession movement.
That was evident at Nephtys Tattos on Rue Wellington in Sherbrooke, where Aline Duquette is manager.
On her forearm Ms. Duquette, 35, bears a fleur-de-lis the very symbol of Quebec independence.
``Very few young people take the fleur-de-lis nowadays,'' Ms. Duquette said.
``They don't like to represent themselves that way anymore.''
