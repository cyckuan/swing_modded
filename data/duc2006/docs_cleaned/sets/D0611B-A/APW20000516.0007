The city plans to make a party out of hunting for grubs by hand as its phase-out of pesticide use begins in earnest.
Hundreds of volunteers will be enlisted for an August get-together, at which they will comb a municipal golf course for signs of the grass-destroying pests that have wreaked havoc in the past.
The goals are early detection and organic solutions.
Buffalo last year joined Albany, San Francisco and a handful of other municipalities that have committed to stopping virtually all pesticide use on city property.
Buffalo's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance took effect in September.
''This is brand new for us,'' said Gary Carrel of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, which is making plans for the first grub-scouting party at the Delaware Park golf course.
Rather than spray the entire course with dangerous chemicals, volunteers will target problem areas in an organized effort.
The hunters will line up five-to-10 feet apart and walk forward in tandem along the fairways, stopping at intervals to pull up small sections of ground and examine them for grubs before replacing them.
''These efforts are more environmentally friendly,'' but, he said, ''they also take a large volunteer force.''
So came the idea for the grub-scouting party.
The hope is there will be no sign of the pests, which staged a major infestation in 1995.
If they are detected, however, there are several non-chemical solutions being considered, including the use of parasitic nematodes which feed on the larvae but don't harm the ground.
Chemical spraying would be a last resort.
''It's just moving to a whole environmentally friendly way,'' Carrel said.
''Golf courses are traditionally very chemical dependent.''
Under the city's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance, the most dangerous chemicals will be eliminated first, followed by the less hazardous pesticides.
Exemptions will be allowed for nontoxic and low-level pesticides and city departments can get waivers in emergencies.
Delaware Park has become a sort of testing ground for environmentally friendly groundskeeping.
The park's rose garden is being tended with organic compound and soon will be watered with a drip-irrigation system, rather than sprinklers, which soak the whole plant and encourage fungus growth, and in turn, pesticide use.
City officials hope residents will follow suit and stop using harmful chemicals on their own lawns.
''Part of our mission is to increase public awareness,'' said Nancy Smith, co-chairwoman of the Pest Management Board, which was formed to help guide the city away from its chemical dependency.
''The exciting thing is, we're getting phone calls from around the country.
We're considered a leader in this.''
