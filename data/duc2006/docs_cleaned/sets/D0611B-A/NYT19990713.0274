In the quest for great grapes, some growers along the northern California coast, including the wine industry leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards.
He said yields have increased and grape quality has improved.
Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the ecology surrounding the vineyard.
It works with nature and involves astronomy and homeopathy.
``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,'' Topolos said.
``We can't continue to poison our way through.''
Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and question its impact on grape quality.
``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell wine,'' said Dr. Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the University of California, Davis.
``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine.''
Biodynamics is so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered for further research at UC Davis.
It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000 of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast.
The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a fringe movement.
``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association.
The approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods.
Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said.
Nationwide, he said, 50 growers have earned biodynamic certification.
Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with a system of composting and special preparations that remains the foundation of the biodynamic farming movement.
Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen, said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine grapes will attain superior flavors flavors that reflect the vineyard site, a term the French call terroir.
Pesticides and herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be copied anywhere else in the world.
Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned his vineyards from toxic chemicals.
``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be duplicated,'' Benziger said.
Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using biodynamic principles.
``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is it going to make a better wine?''
Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards for its ultra-premium wines.
``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones requirement to make a great wine.''
Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture encourages chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and routine disking, which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor.
``Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines.
The hardest thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and spraying when you see a problem,'' Benziger said.
What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers is biodynamics' strange practices, such as applying herbal potions by the phases of the moon, spraying microscopic crystals and burying cow dung in a female cow horn.
Greg Willis, the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards, said the buried horns, crystals and moon calendar that are part and parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some growers to embrace.
He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes and try something new.
``We can argue all day about putting a horn in the ground, but we know it works,'' said Willis, owner of a Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis.
Interest in biodynamics is growing, Beedy said.
``We are hearing from people that organic farming didn't answer all the questions they had.
They had questions about the unseen quality of life and how to work with the forces of nature,'' he said.
Alan York, a biodynamics expert, manages the vineyards at Jim Fetzer's Ceago Vinegarden.
He is also advising the Benziger Family Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics.
Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years, said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can fend off insects and diseases.
Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces ``some that we understand and some that we don't'' is key to its success, he said.
The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice.
It's dug up in the spring.
The manure ferments into a sweet-smelling humus-like material Topolos calls it black magic that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land.
Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of thinking.
As both an organic and biodynamic farmer, Topolos said there is some overlap between the two, but that there are real differences.
He said organic farming is more passive.
``Organic farming is not doing things,'' Topolos said.
``Biodynamics is quite the opposite.
Not only do we do things, we have to do them on a schedule based on a lunar calendar.''
