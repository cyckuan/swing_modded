Yunnan plans to expand the acreage to 70,000 ha next year, and nine provincial areas in China, the country's major rice-producing areas, also plan to introduce the technique following satisfactory experiments of their own, said Li.
He said the Asian Development Bank, one of the sponsors of the program, plans to introduce the technique to countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
In their latest issues published on August 17 or August 18, the weekly science magazines Nature and Science each published a paper by Professor Zhu and his colleagues on the experiments.
Christopher Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis and a co-author of the paper, explained that different types of rice blast attack different varieties of rice.
In a monoculture field of rice, the blast can spread "like a fire through a field of dry grass."
The fungus has a harder time finding a compatible host in a mixed environment.
In his commentary on the experiments published by Nature, Martin Wolfe, a plant pathologist and research director of the Elm Farm Research Center, an organic farming research center in Britain, supports the approach.
Rice is the staple grain for about 3 billion people, mostly in Asia, or half of the world's population.
