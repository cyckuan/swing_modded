have looked closely to try to find an insect, and something appears to hop away when I move the leaves.
Any clue as to what this is?
Flea beetles are minuscule insects adults are about 1/16 inch long and black or greenish-black that appear in spring and leap among plants and chew numerous, small holes in leaves.
They hop like fleas, therefore their common name.
If there are enough of them, they can do considerable damage.
Leaves may wilt and turn brown, and the plant may die.
There are several species of flea beetles that damage vegetables and ornamentals.
Among those that visit here are the tobacco flea beetle, the potato flea beetle and the eggplant flea beetle, which prefer nightshade-family plants such as eggplant and tomatoes.
You may find flea beetles in your arugula, broccoli and corn, as well.
This pest is an accidental import, thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
Adult flea beetles hibernate in the soil, then lay eggs in the soil or around the base of a plant.
In a week or so, larvae are feeding on plant roots before pupating and emerging as adults.
Seemingly overnight, flea beetles recently visited our garden, peppering the leaves of two fuchsias with so many small holes that they left mere outlines of the foliage.
If you are an organic gardener, you need quick hands to catch and squish these agile pests, as they bound away with the slightest hint of your approach.
They can slip underneath a leaf before you bat an eye.
Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied, and this, coupled with their acrobatic ability, makes it tough to easily nab them with a pesticide.
The pesticide needs to make good contact with the beetles, so you may be looking at more than one application.
Some of the chemicals commonly used around the garden target the pests.
So do products that contain neem, a botanical pesticide.
Rotenone and pyrethrum products can work, too.
In addition to eliminating as many of the enemy as possible with speedy fingers, the organic gardener has additional options: Use row covers to keep the pests off spring vegetables; repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays; or capture them on white or yellow sticky traps.
Could you give me some advice on the care of my bearded iris?
All bloom poorly.
What fertilizer should I use?
When and how often?
Do these irises require an acid or alkaline soil?
Then they get only rainwater until next spring.
When I separate them and give them to friends, these irises bloom quite well.
``Iris x albicans,'' the cemetery whites, are another group of more easily grown bearded iris.
And, as you've found, division encourages better flowering.
This is often necessary every three years.
These irises tolerate a soil pH between 6 and 9, preferring a soil that is slightly alkaline.
Apply such a fertilizer in the fall and after flowering.
An application of a superphosphate in late February, before flowering, can be beneficial.
Give them adequate moisture, but don't overdo it, especially if the soil is slow to drain.
My magnolia is dropping leaves.
What's the problem?
Magnolias, although called ``evergreen,'' must drop old leaves to make room for new.
Those in our neighborhood are shedding like crazy.
By late winter, magnolia leaves, having been on the tree for a growing season, often look weary.
They may be scorched, and even have fungal spots.
Then, in late April and May, the tree drops these leaves.
If your tree is replacing these with fresh, healthy leaves, don't worry.
Magnolias may also drop leaves at other times during the year.
Keep trees watered well.
The roots are especially shallow, and long, hot summers are tough.
It also boosts the soil when it breaks down.
