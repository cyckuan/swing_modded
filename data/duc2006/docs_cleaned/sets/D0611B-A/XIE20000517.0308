Beijing has sold out of ladybugs and other varieties of pest-eating insects, as residents of the Chinese capital have opted for a cheap and environmentally- friendly means of pest control.
The city's supply of several million ladybugs had been housed by the Biological Prevention Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science for use in scientific experiments.
But they went on sale when the prevalence of plant pests in the city in the first four months of the year created public outcry, today's Beijing Daily reported.
During the same period, tens of thousands of insects kept by the Chinese Academy of Forestry Science also became hot items in short supply.
Increasingly, Beijing's parks and work units are battling pests with bugs.
The Temple of Heaven Park, Beijing's first park to use the pest-control insects, initiated the method in 1991.
The park has brought in a large quantity of insects to kill tree pests this year and the results have been good, according to park officials.
He said the anti-pest insects can also be applied to crops, and for vegetable and fruit tree growth, and will help to improve the quality of farm produce.
Ladybugs are less expensive than pesticides, selling for a few cents apiece.
