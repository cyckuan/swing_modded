Every 20 seconds, someone in the United States is arrested for a drug violation.
Every week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world's largest penal system.
It was not always so.
Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to those of other democracies.
But in the 1980s crack cocaine scared the country, and the criminal justice system has never been the same.
Crack poisoned many communities.
Dealers turned neighborhoods into drug markets.
As heavily armed gangs fought over turf, murder rates shot up.
Authorities warned that crack was instantly addictive and spreading rapidly, and predicted that a generation of crack babies would bear the drug's imprint.
It looked like a nightmare with no end.
But for all the havoc wreaked by crack, the worst fears were not realized.
Crack appealed mainly to hard-core drug users.
The number of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting them.
Yet crack left its mark, in ways that few people anticipated.
Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws, lock up a record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons.
It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights, courts.
Crack also changed the racial makeup of U.S. prisons.
More whites than blacks use crack, according to surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a far higher rate.
In California, five black men are behind bars for each one in a state university.
But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall drug use.
And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind them.
``We have a failed social policy and it has to be re-evaluated,'' said Barry McCaffrey, the four-star general who heads the National Drug Control Policy Office.
``Otherwise, we're going to bankrupt ourselves.
Because we can't incarcerate our way out of this problem.''
More than a quarter-million Americans in prison for drug offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs, he said, saving up to $5 billion a year.
Since 1985 the nation's jail and prison population has grown 130 percent, and it will soon pass 2 million, even as crime rates continue a six-year decline.
No country has more people behind bars, and only one, Russia, has a higher incarceration rate, according to the Sentencing Project, which tracks prison rates.
Behind the increase is a national get-tough mood that has produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole in many states.
Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms for violent criminals.
But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing of drug offenders.
In the first 10 years after Congress toughened drug laws in response to crack, the number of people imprisoned for drugs grew more than 400 percent, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals.
More people are behind bars for drug offenses in the United States about 400,000 than are in prison for all crimes in England, France, Germany and Japan combined.
Crack's legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land, even in the Mojave Desert, where the newest federal prison is rising at the dusty edge of Victorville.
In an age of government downsizing, the federal corrections budget has grown more than tenfold in a decade, to nearly $4 billion, yet prisons are so stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity almost from the day it opens.
Some experts argue what might seem obvious: that high incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.
``Putting people in prison has been the single most important thing we've done to reduce crime,'' Dr. James Q. Wilson, the political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments for a generation, has written.
In New York, the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands of drug offenders was a major factor in the city's turning the corner on crime.
``What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the low-level dealers,'' said Bridget Brennan, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York.
``When they take over a street or a stoop, everyone else is terrified.
When you put those people in jail, it gives the community a sense that order has been restored.''
What the prison boom has not done, however, is reduce illicit drug use, national surveys show.
Far fewer Americans use illegal drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970s.
But almost all of the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in response to it.
The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for 1997, estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal drug in the last month, a number barely changed since 1988.
Of those, 600,000 had smoked crack within a month, unchanged since 1988.
But during that time, imprisonment rates soared.
``What's happened across the board is that police started going after small-time street dealers and users,'' said Dr. Steven Belenko, a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
Crack never became a mainstream drug, but the fear of it changed perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs, according to Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.
``Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice system than it had on the communities and the drug users,'' said Dr. Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California School of Law.
``This secondary impact, on police and prisons, may end up being more negative than anything associated with the drug.''
Among governors, teachers, criminologists and police chiefs, there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the height of the crack panic have transformed the nation.
But in Congress, which enacted the laws without a single hearing, there is nothing.
For crack has left one other major legacy: The policy discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for more than a decade.
Crime Rate Falls, More Prisons Are Built The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian Mountains in Schuylkill County, Pa., are a world removed from the city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the mid-1980s.
But the legacy of crack is all around.
The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.
Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and jails would be booming.
The state has an aging population.
Crime has never been a particularly big problem; among the states, Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom.
But every year for the last 14 years, Pennsylvania has added at least one prison, and the corrections budget has soared to more than $1 billion a year, a fivefold increase over a decade.
In 1988, not long before President George Bush spoke to the nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack, Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs.
No time off for first-time offenders.
No community service.
No treatment for addicts.
Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress, which had set the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with laws enacted in 1986 and 1988.
Ten years later, its inmate population had grown 225 percent, to 35,600.
Pennsylvania spends an average of $20,000 a year for each one, about the national average.
