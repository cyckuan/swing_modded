Property crime was down 8 percent last year, and was 17 percent lower than 1993.
Other crimes against persons, including rape, attempted rape, other sexual assaults and aggravated assaults, also were down dramatically during the 1993-96 period.
Likewise, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, personal theft such as purse snatching fell 19 percent, 29 percent, 35 percent respectively.
There were an estimated 2.7 million "completed'' violent crimes in 1996, for a rate of 12.4 per 1,000 U.S. residents 12 years or older.
In contrast, there were 3 million in 1995, a rate of 13.8.
Property crimes and attempts dropped from 29.5 million, or 291 per 1000 households, to 27.4 million, or 266 per 1000 households.
