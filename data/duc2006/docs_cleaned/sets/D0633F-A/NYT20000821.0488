That is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were executed in Florida and Georgia.
Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned youthful offenders those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States.
While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated.
Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty.''
But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were, according to most laws, still children when they committed their crimes.
The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions, according to the State Department.
Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties, including the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified.
``It offends my conscience to execute someone who was under 18 at the time of the crime,'' said District Attorney Joshua Marquis, of Astoria, Ore., a member of the board of the National Association of District Attorneys, who otherwise supports the death penalty.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in 1989.
The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions.
No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed.
Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
Experts say that it is little surprise that most are Southern states, since the South has the highest incarceration rate and the highest execution rate in general.
This year, Virginia and Texas each executed two men who committed their crimes when they were under 18.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year.
Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund oppose death sentences for juvenile offenders.
In South Carolina, several former prosecutors formed a group to protect juvenile offenders last year when they learned their state has four on death row.
``Considering all the ways the government failed our children from crack babies to horrible public schools to miserable health care, we can at least ask the government not to willfully kill them,'' said Zoe Sanders Nettles, a former prosecutor who helped found the group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Execution of Children.
In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned youthful offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was white and female.
The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls.
They were all between the ages of 17 and 19 when they were electrocuted.
Williams' lawyers have asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Williams' sentence to life imprisonment and are planning a last-minute appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, has also written, asking that Williams' sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
Carter wrote: ``As a society we traditionally have given special consideration to children who commit crimes because we recognize that they lack the maturity or the mental capacity to function as adults.''
Williams' cause has also been taken up by the European Union, a measure of the repugnance other Western countries have for the execution of juvenile offenders.
While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S. State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty International.
China, which executes more people than any other country in the world, formally banned the execution of juvenile offenders in 1997.
Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
Besides the prohibition in the U.N. treaty, the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
The U.S. Senate voted to ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders.
Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime.
The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor.
Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated.
``The empirical and moral question here is, at what age can we be so sure of a person's inability to change in the context of an attempt by society to change that person that we would sentence that person to death?''
Law enforcement officials and politicians who favor the treatment of teen-age offenders as adults say the traditional juvenile justice system was not set up to handle the numbers of teen-agers who now have access to guns, and who commit the types of crimes that are punished with the death penalty.
Alexander Williams was 17 in 1986 when he abducted 16-year-old Aleta Bunch from a shopping mall in Augusta, Ga., then raped and fatally shot her.
Aleta's mother, Carolyn Bunch, said of her daughter's killer in a recent interview, ``I don't care how old he was.
He was old enough to know better.
He shot her three times in the forehead.
He shot her eye out.
He shot her in the heart.''
Daniel Craig, the district attorney in Augusta, said in an interview that he opposes clemency for Williams because the jury had ``determined that the appropriate response of a civilized society is the death penalty.''
Under Georgia law, at 17 Williams was automatically charged as an adult, but it was the prosecutor's decision to seek the death penalty.
Williams is described in prison records as mentally ill: records indicate he is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder, which reportedly leads him to worship the actress Sigourney Weaver as god and to dress as the Lone Ranger.
As a juvenile, he was charged with several offenses, including reckless conduct for holding a knife to a 13-year-old classmate's throat.
Williams' sister, Alexsandriya Clemons, and half-brother, Rodney Blair, have both sworn affidavits describing the abuse their mother meted out to all of them as children.
In an interview in Jackson, Ga., last month, where they were visiting their brother on death row, they said their mother had beaten them frequently with electrical cords, frying pans, belts, barbells and a vacuum cleaner.
Their brother Alexander, they said, bore the brunt of the worst abuse.
``One time she was hitting his toes with a screwdriver and a hammer,'' Clemons said.
They said their mother, Pat Blair, held down three jobs while supporting five children.
She declined to be interviewed for this article.
At the trial, Alexander Williams' lawyer, O.L.
Collins, who has since died, did not present any of the details of his client's childhood.
Last week, four jurors, and a fifth this week, swore affidavits stating that had they known about Williams' childhood abuse, and his mental illness, they would not have voted to sentence him to death.
It is for that reason they, too, are asking Georgia's pardons board to grant Williams clemency.
As children the offenders had to figure out ``how not to get beaten to a pulp or sexually abused by one of the so-called adults who'd been placed in charge of them,'' said Craig Haney, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz, who has compiled the social histories of many juvenile offenders on death row for defense lawyers.
That kind of early abuse can lead to aggression and violence, Haney and other experts contend.
Haney and other experts also say that the stereotypical image of teen-age killers as superpredators who cannot be redeemed is not borne out by scientific evidence.
``Even people who are cynical about the rehabilitation of adults recognize that juveniles are different,'' Haney said.
``It's the notion that human nature is unfolding.
It's not until later in someone's life that you're willing to throw up your hands and say there is nothing more we can do now.''
But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently.
``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant manager in Mobile, Ala., in 1989.
``Gary Hart is a predator.''
Gary Hart, who is on Alabama's death row, testified at trial that an older man had given him and a friend instructions on how to rob the restaurant.
The shooting, he said, had been an accident.
Once he had cocked the gun, he did not know how to uncock it, he said.
He said he had taken the gun from the trunk of his mother's car.
Christopher Simmons, who is on death row in Missouri, was 4 when his stepfather began taking him to bars and pouring him drinks, defense psychologists say.
His stepfather would tie young Christopher to a tree when he went fishing.
At 17, in the course of a burglary in 1983, Christopher and a 15-year-old friend bound and gagged a 46-year-old woman and pushed her into a river and she drowned.
The 15-year-old was given life without parole.
``Seventeen years old,'' the prosecutor said of Christopher at his trial.
``Doesn't that scare you?
Mitigating?
Quite the contrary, I submit.''
The prosecutor suggested that Christopher's family would be better off if he were executed.
``Show some mercy to his family,'' he said.
``Give him death.''
Kevin Hughes had a mother who was a schizophrenic and an alcoholic, according to court records.
Left alone by their mother for weeks at a time, Kevin and his five siblings begged on the streets of Philadelphia for money and food, according to affidavits filed by several relatives.
The mother had a series of violent boyfriends, who beat and raped Kevin while his mother laughed, according to the affidavits.
``Kevin got really bad beatings and whippings because he could not understand things and was mentally slow,'' his oldest brother said in his affidavit.
Kevin Hughes, now 38, was 16 when he raped and strangled a 9-year-old girl, Rochelle Graham.
He has been on death row in Pennsylvania for 17 years.
