Chicago is the United States' 1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide totals for the first time ever.
New York has seen a dramatic drop in its homicides.
There were 629 there last year, compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more than double that of New York.
"One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the numbers go down," Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
He credited the city's community policing program for much of the decline.
But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.
Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently in the last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities.
In that same period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
