particularly the working poor who are having an increasingly hard time finding affordable housing.
That's an increase of 12 percent since 1991.
Federal officials released the report to Congress, which is currently considering a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide.
''Everything is going so well , it's hard to imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday.
''But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable housing.''
That, in turn, is driving up rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa.
''They want the city back,'' Magdalena Mendez said of suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabbed homes just blocks from the three-unit Chicago building she must vacate today.
The bank is foreclosing on her landlord.
She is having trouble finding anything for less than $800 per month in the same neighborhood as her children's schools.
That's more than she makes in a month.
It's not that gentrification is a new concept.
But statistics show that it is an accelerating one.
Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class, predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning upscale.
In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower East Side are being converted into luxury units.
''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on Chicago's North Side.
But, he added, that is more easily said than done.
''The Daley administration has made it clear that their focus is middle and upper-class people,'' Tobin said, referring to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.
Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Housing, disputed that claim, pointing to a $4 million trust fund used to subsidize low-income renters and their landlords.
But she noted that, like many cities nationwide, Chicago's goal is to create mixed-income neighborhoods, rather than having large pockets of poverty.
''That's what a healthy city needs,'' she said.
In the meantime, Mendez's ex-husband has taken custody of their children until she finds a suitable place for them to live.
She plans to live with her two sisters while she seeks apartments and is almost to the point where she'd take government help if it becomes available.
''But I'm not sure I have a choice anymore.''
