Lawmakers hope a bill approved by the House Banking Committee on Friday will counter a trend that is reducing the amount of government-subsidized housing available for the elderly and the disabled.
Committee members approved the bill unanimously in a voice vote and sent it for consideration to the full House.
Over a period of 2 1/2 years, ending in December 1998, nearly 100,000 units of Department of Housing and Urban Development housing, most of it administered under the Section 8 program for low-income elderly, disabled and families, have been lost, according to the nonprofit National Housing Trust.
About half of those units are at risk because their rents are below market rates, according to the trust.
The bill, which increases funding for housing programs by $71 million, seeks to modernize the program and provide incentives to building owners to stay in the program.
One provision would forgive building owners' outstanding governmental loans, which would give nonprofit groups relief from heavy debt service.
The bill would also create mixed-income senior citizen and disabled housing environments.
And it would provide incentives for building owners to convert government-subsidized and public housing projects to assisted living facilities, which provide meals, health care and other services to the elderly who need help with the daily activities of living.
Another provision would authorize money for nonprofit organizations seeking to purchase, improve and preserve affordable federally assisted and federally insured housing for the benefit of low-income tenants.
The legislation also would provide market-level vouchers so tenants could stay in their buildings even after the buildings have gone private, and would promote building sales to nonprofit organizations.
The bill is H.R.
