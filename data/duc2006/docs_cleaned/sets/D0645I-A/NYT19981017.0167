With the Seattle job market strong and the housing market tight, the Housing Authority in next-door Snohomish County has moved away from its traditional role and become a builder, on a break-even basis, of for-sale housing for moderate-income working families.
Fifty manufactured houses on a five-acre site called Thomas Place will be sold this fall to first-time buyers whose households earn from $25,000 to $60,000 a year.
Median income for a family of four in the county is $59,000.
The average price of new houses constructed in the county by private builders in the '90s is $193,960, an indication that younger buyers are for the most part forced out of the market.
Three-bedroom houses in Thomas Place sell for $63,800, four-bedrooms for $79,750.
In the past, the Housing Authority's mission had mainly been to produce and maintain low-income rental housing with the help of government subsides.
The agency owns more than 1,200 units of low- and moderate-income housing and offers rent subsidies in 1,900 additional units.
But with the disappearance of federal money to build new low- and moderate-income housing, local governments have asked housing agencies to create home-ownership programs for working people in need of housing, said Robert Davis, executive director of the Snohomish County Housing Authority.
``We are well organized, solvent and have the construction and financing expertise to do this,'' Davis said.
``We are not taking anything away from the other services we provide.''
The Housing Authority is not alone among other such agencies searching for ways to produce housing without federal subsidies.
``Because the federal government has stopped funding new affordable housing, local agencies are finding other ways to meet their needs,'' said Richard Y. Nelson Jr., executive director of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials in Washington.
The Colorado Springs, Colo., Housing Authority will complete construction in six weeks of 20 town houses that it is financing.
``We're ready to sign contracts with six first-time buyers and we are screening 100 applications to buy the remaining 14 homes,'' says Richard Sullivan, executive director of the authority.
Qualified buyers are families earning 60 to 80 percent of the city's median income.
The 80 percent figure is $36,650.
Mortgages are financed through the Colorado Housing Finance Authority, which requires just a $1,000 down payment on a house.
Two 30-year mortgages are offered to qualified buyers to cover the cost of a house one for 75 percent of the cost at 5.4 percent by the finance agency, the other for 25 percent of the cost at 1.5 percent by the Colorado Springs Housing authority.
In Montgomery County, Md., a densely built suburban county adjacent to Washington, D.C., developers are granted greater density in exchange for setting aside 15 percent of the housing units in a project for moderate-income families at below-market rents or sale prices.
The Housing Authority then buys a third of the units in that 15 percent to rent as subsidized housing.
At Thomas Place, close to Mill Creek and about 20 minutes north of downtown Seattle on Interstate 5, there were more than 250 applications to buy the dwellings within days after models opened in mid-August.
The energy-efficient models, ranging in size from 1,080 to 1,400 square feet, had two-car carports or garages, high vaulted ceilings, French doors, wood exterior siding, oak cabinets in the kitchen and an oval tub in the master-bedroom suite.
``This interest exceeds our wildest expectation,'' said Ann Schroeder Osterberg, the Housing Authority's director of corporate planning.
Buyers need a $2,500 down payment, for which the Housing Authority provides assistance to its lowest-income buyers at 2 percent interest and the Washington Manufactured Housing Association will give five new owners whose income is 50 percent or less of the median grants up to $2,500 each.
To build as many dwellings as possible, the houses fill most of the lots, which range in size from 2,800 to 5,300 square feet, with only five-foot spaces between the houses and ``postage stamp'' backyards.
Four years ago, the rundown Thomas Lake Mobile Home Park occupied a corner of the property.
Occupants were in danger of losing their housing because septic and water systems were failing.
The Housing Authority acquired the land and brought in emergency services.
The trailer park will be phased out as occupants move, and nine of the 50 units will be built there.
The Housing Authority will continue to own the property and is charging a monthly land lease of $295 for the lots ranging in size from 2,800 square feet to 5,300 square feet.
The money will be returned to Thomas Place to pay for water and sewers, garbage pickup, roads, street lights, landscaping and a resident manager's salary.
Thomas Place will cost the Housing Authority about $5 million when developed.
Some $1.1 million from the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, which offers grants and loans to public and nonprofit agencies to develop low-income housing, and the federal Community Development Block Grant will go toward buying the property for $360,000 and renovating the trailer park and infrastructure.
Seafirst Bank, a Bank of America subsidiary, provided a line of credit to finance infrastructure.
The Housing Authority issued $1 million in bonds to repay this loan.
In addition, it issued $2.9 million in revenue bonds and sold them to private investors.
This created the pool for mortgages that the Housing Authority provides at 7.012 percent fixed interest for 30 years, a rate comparable to that charged for traditional ``stick-built'' housing.
Buyers must have stable employment and not be saddled with excessive debt.
The Snohomish housing agency had previously constructed on various sites about a dozen houses that it sold to residents earning about 80 percent of the county's median income.
But, said Ms. Schroeder Osterberg, ``we concluded this was the expensive way to go.''
Manufactured homes cost about one third less ``and provided us with a more affordable product.''
The Thomas Place homes built by Moduline Industries of Chehalis, Wash., bear little resemblance to the wide, metal-sided, interior-paneled homes of the past, says Joan Brown, executive director of the Washington Manufactured Housing Association.
``We've had major advances, the industry has stepped up to the energy issue and when a manufacturer says to Maytag `I need 10,000 dishwashers,' the company can cut a pretty good price,'' said Mrs. Brown.
Davis said that ``based on the incredible success'' of Thomas Place, providing two-story manufactured homes for working people will be his next step ``so we can get the best property density.''
But, he added, ``it is a couple of years away, the land use process takes time.''
Across Puget Sound from Seattle, the Kitsap County Consolidated Housing Authority plans to build several hundred manufactured homes, mostly on land it owns near Bremerton that is platted for 250 houses.
It will retain land ownership so home buyers can avoid the expense of property taxes.
