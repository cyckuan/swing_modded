Congressional negotiators and the Clinton administration are very close to agreement on legislation that would allow public housing authorities to put more working families into apartments that in recent years have been reserved almost exclusively for the very poor.
The change has been sought by officials in many cities who contend that large concentrations of extremely poor people in public housing projects have shattered neighborhoods, sapped their commercial vitality and left them devoid of stable families.
For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year for families making as much as $40,000 a year.
The city's housing authority considers the bill a necessary first step toward creating a marketing strategy designed to encourage higher income families to move into its housing projects.
The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the Republican bill would leave poor people without housing.
But Cuomo has negotiated changes in the bill that have made it acceptable to many Democrats.
Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other housing measures that are likely to make it easier for congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept the public housing bill.
One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.
If approved, the increase would be the first in about five years.
Nearly 3 million households now receive housing vouchers.
The second would make federally insured mortgages available to at least 17,000 more home buyers a year.
Though both of those measures would make relatively small increases in public housing resources, Cuomo contends they are important because the Republican-controlled Congress has perennially talked of cutting housing programs.
Lobbyists for housing authorities said the bill also includes a provision sought by several cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, that would make it easier to demolish aging projects.
And housing officials across the country are pushing for the legislation because they contend it will help them bring teachers, municipal workers and other low-income working families into projects.
New York City has historically had a much more broader mix of income groups in public housing than other large cities, and housing experts say that diversity has helped make the city's projects more livable than elsewhere.
But New York officials say that federal rules favoring the very poor have caused the percentage of working families in the city's public housing to plummet from half of all tenant households in 1983 to a third today.
They contend that if the rules are not changed, the city's projects will become bastions of deep poverty, causing the kinds of problems that plague the nation's most notorious housing systems, like those in Chicago and Baltimore.
``Public housing was never intended to be an enclave for the very, very poor,'' said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority, the nation's largest, with nearly 600,000 tenants.
``Historically, the public housing population reflected the diversity of the communities, with people who carried lunch pails, who were role models.''
Negotiations on the 400-page public housing bill have reached a delicate stage, with a number of thorny details still to be resolved.
But those involved in the talks expressed guarded optimism late last week that the remaining differences would be resolved and that a bill would reach the president's desk in September.
``Would I say it is a certainty?
No,'' said Cuomo.
``Am I cautiously optimistic?
Yes.''
Because the legislation would make some of the largest changes to federal housing policy in many years, the negotiations have often bogged down over political and symbolic issues.
Republicans contend that the proposed changes would represent a philosophical sea change in federal policy, moving away from decades-old requirements that housing authorities focus their resources almost entirely on the poorest of the poor.
They contend the bill would also provide incentives for tenants to find work and buy homes.
``The hope is that the perception of housing authorities will be restored to where it was in the '30s and '40s: a place where people were proud to live,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community development and the lead House negotiator.
``Where you had teachers, policeman and city workers living alongside people with no income.''
But Democrats, led by Cuomo, and groups representing public housing tenants have fought to preserve protections for the very poor, including a requirement that housing authorities provide a minimum number of units for the very poor and maximum limits on rents.
Cuomo had argued that an earlier draft of the House bill would have left 1.8 million senior citizens and children without housing.
Many housing experts said that the compromise now taking shape calls for narrowly drafted changes that could meet the political needs of both sides.
On the thorniest issue, for instance how to bring more working families into public housing the proposed changes would pare back federal requirements for housing the very poor.
But the changes would be incremental enough that they probably would not be noticed for years because turnover in most housing authorities is low and waiting lists are long.
``You're not going to see any swift changes in composition,'' said Richard Nelson, executive director of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
Despite the compromises, some advocates for the poor say the housing bill would still hurt very low-income families because it would reduce the number of units available to them.
``Poor folks would almost never have an opportunity to get into public housing if the current provisions are passed,'' warned Ed Williams, a founder of the New York City Public Housing Resident Alliance, a tenant advocacy group.
Current federal rules strictly limit the number of vacant apartments a housing authority can rent to the working poor, defined as families earning more than 50 percent of a region's median annual income.
In New York City, the limit is 25 percent.
The federal government has also required housing authorities to give preference to the homeless, people spending more than half their income on rent, victims of domestic violence and people displaced by government action.
Those preferences were suspended last year, but remain on the books.
The compromise bill is expected to abolish the federal preferences, allow local housing authorities to set their own preferences and increase the number of units available to working families by between 5 and 10 percent a year, negotiators said.
The bill would not change current eligibility rules, under which public housing is available only to people earning less than 80 percent of a region's median income.
The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units for higher income families provided they exceeded federal requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
Cuomo is also pushing a provision that would require housing authorities to integrate higher income tenants into the lowest income projects, to prevent authorities from segregating the poorest tenants in the worst buildings.
Negotiators said the bill will probably repeal a requirement that links rent increases to increases in income, a rule that Republicans say discourages people from working.
One of the more contentious unresolved issues involves a proposal by Lazio to allow mayors or county executives to assume direct control of poorly run housing authorities, upon the permission of the housing secretary.
Housing officials and Cuomo strongly oppose the idea, and are pushing a plan that would restrict such takeovers to only the most troubled authorities.
Another issue that has not been clearly resolved involves a proposal to allow tenants in family housing projects to own pets.
New York City and other large housing authorities object to the proposal, warning that vicious dogs could terrorize tenants and housing police officers.
Negotiators said the bill was likely to leave the issue in the hands of local housing authorities.
But many housing officials oppose that idea because they fear that political pressure from pet owners will force them to allow pets in projects.
Some officials said the negotiations have been complicated by the fiercely competitive relationships entangling three of the major players, all New Yorkers: Cuomo, Lazio and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate banking committee, which oversees housing policy.
Cuomo and Lazio are considered potential rivals for the seat of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan if he chooses not to run in 2000.
D'Amato is responsible for helping to unseat Cuomo's father, Gov.
