Senate and House negotiators reached agreement Monday on a bill that would make rent subsidies available to more poor families and allow more home buyers to qualify for federally backed mortgages.
The bill, which seems assured of passage by Congress and of President Clinton's signature, would create about 90,000 Section 8 vouchers, or federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.
It would also raise the loan limits on federally insured mortgages to $197,621 from $170,362.
``This puts HUD back in the housing business,'' Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
Cuomo said that both the rental-subsidy provision and the higher ceiling for mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration would have wide impact in New York City and other metropolitan areas, where there are long waiting lists for housing assistance.
Cuomo said the creation of 90,000 rental vouchers was especially important, because no new Section 8 vouchers have been authorized since 1994.
Nearly three million households now receive housing vouchers.
Only two months ago, HUD negotiators had thought they might persuade lawmakers to authorize 15,000 new vouchers.
Authorization of the far higher number left housing officials ``ecstatic,'' as one put it Monday.
Cuomo said the higher mortgage ceiling would benefit about 70,000 families, many of them members of minority groups.
Assuming that the HUD portion passes more or less intact, the housing agency's funds for the fiscal year that began last Thursday would increase about $2 billion, to $26 billion.
Democrats had pushed for measures to prevent housing agencies from separating working families from the very poor, and thus fostering racial as well as economic segregation.
Republicans had pushed for measures to help the working poor who live in public housing.
Cuomo, saying the bill met both needs, praised negotiators from both parties.
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the Banking Committee's housing subcommittee, said the House Republican leadership had eased the way for the bill by combining it with the appropriations bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
