With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President Clinton highlighted two new housing programs Saturday that would provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or disabled.
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that the money would benefit 29,400 people living in 48 states, and the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.
Montana and North Dakota, sparsely populated states, are the only two that are not slated to receive any of the money.
``For millions of struggling senior citizens and people with disabilities, the peace and security of a decent home is a distant dream and the threat of homelessness an ever-present nightmare,'' Clinton said, discussing the programs, which are included in the new budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
``Too many of these hard-pressed Americans are warehoused in sterile nursing homes not because they need to be, but because they can't afford to live anywhere else.''
He added: ``Americans should never have to choose between putting a meal on the table or putting a roof over their heads.''
The administration's $25 billion housing budget for the 1999 fiscal year was one of the few appropriation requests that met with little opposition in the Republican-led Congress this year.
It included $1.8 billion in new spending for vouchers, which reflected the first major increase in housing spending in four years and also the department's efforts to rid itself of wasteful programs and mismanagement that characterized it in the past.
The larger of the programs Clinton cited in his radio address generates $696 million in grants to nonprofit organizations around the country to build and rehabilitate 8,200 apartment units for older people and the disabled who fall below certain income levels.
The second program will provide an additional $126.8 million to be distributed among disabled people in the form of rent subsidies.
Administration officials predict that the new apartments will accommodate 12,400 people through projects managed by 166 private groups that competed for the grants.
The money will cover development costs and does not have to be repaid so long as the new housing is available for 40 years to low-income elderly residents or people with disabilities.
More money is available to the project owner to cover differences between the rent and operating costs.
Those receiving the assistance must be classified as ``very low income,'' which means that a household cannot earn more than 50 percent of the area's median income.
On a national average, administration officials say that amounts to less than $8,000 a year.
The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income.
``This is going to be a priority for the president,'' Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said in an interview.
``We're all getting older, not only individually, but as a society, and the numbers are alarming,'' Cuomo said.
``The graying of America is going to have significant impact on the nation's housing and will be one of the greatest challenges we face over the next 10 years.''
34 million citizens 65 or older, compared with about 3 million at the turn of the 20th century.
Cuomo said that the figure was expected to reach 53 million within 25 years, putting additional strain on the need for affordable units.
As a result, Cuomo said, the department and the private organizations that are building new units are redesigning them with older and disabled people in mind, focusing on communal facilities for health and recreation.
Clinton said that despite the benefits most Americans are accruing through the prosperous economy, too many elderly and disabled people ``are trapped in substandard housing, where broken plumbing, inadequate heat and hazardous hallways are a dangerous fact of life.
And too many spend more than half of their modest incomes on housing, often sacrificing basic needs like food and medical care just to pay the rent.''
Promoting the administration's efforts, he added, ``At this moment of unparalleled prosperity, we must not do less.''
