While the United States is enjoying continuing prosperity, many of the working poor have become worse off because affordable housing is harder for them to find, a federal report said Monday.
The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991.
``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his department's headquarters.
Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down.''
Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself.
In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher program known as Section 8.
But because of the nation's rising prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the subsidies.
Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went out of the housing business.''
He blamed the Republicans in Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress said zero.''
When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved by Congress in a four-year period, but he said that there were good reasons for that .
