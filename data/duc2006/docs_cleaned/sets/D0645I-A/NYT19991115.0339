The trust, which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration, would be used to help create rental housing for low- and moderate-income families, and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs across the nation.
The trust fund proposal to create affordable housing is the centerpiece of an address Kerry is scheduled to deliver Tuesday night at the 32nd annual dinner of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association Inc. (CHAPA) in Boston.
``The truth is, housing is the forgotten stepchild in the policy debate at the national level,'' Kerry said in a prepared statement.
He said the federal government ``has to begin to again play a more aggressive role in increasing supply.''
During the 1980s, the federal government helped build an average of 128,000 affordable housing units per year, but that number fell to just 53,000 affordable units per year in the 1990s, according to CHAPA.
Worse, Kerry's office noted, the declining federal commitment has come at a time of soaring rents and real estate prices a situation that is especially acute in Massachusetts and in the face of a rapidly growing elderly population.
In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing units, officials said.
Those numbers do not include tens of thousands of moderate-income families in need of affordable housing.
Housing advocates Monday applauded Kerry's housing trust fund proposal.
They said his position on the Senate Housing subcommitteee, combined with growing calls for affordable housing from local officials, would give the proposal high visibility in the next session of Congress.
``There's a huge shortage of rental housing for families and the elderly.
We need to do something to address that shortage, and this proposal does,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive director of CHAPA, which is one of the region's most respected nonprofit housing groups.
The centerpiece of Kerry's plan calls for creation of a new national housing trust, set up much like the federal highway trust fund, which would take revenues generated by the FHA and reserve them for use exclusively in federal housing initiatives.
Congressional sources and housing officials said Monday the FHA generates about $2 billion annually from insurance guarantees it provides as one of the nation's largest mutual mortgage funds, and from related sources.
Officials said Monday the $2 billion was in excess of reserves the FHA is required to set aside.
The money currently goes into the nation's general fund.
According to an outline of the proposal, many of the legislative efforts would be directed toward helping local and state governments build affordable housing and boost the rate of homeownership through an array of existing, but underfunded, programs.
Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and a former head of the FHA, said Kerry's proposal was a ``noteworthy'' way of addressing the shortage of affordable housing.
``He's trying to find ways to give more resources to this problem.
It's a growing problem, and it's not going to go away,'' Retsinas said.
Under Kerry's proposal, the housing trust fund would be used to expand rental housing for families, preserve and renovate existing affordable housing, and increase subsidized housing and assisted living for elderly, whose numbers are expected to grow dramatically in the next 20 years.
Kerry is also calling for more aid to low-income and first-time home buyers through a program of tax credits to investors in below-market second mortgages.
Another would allow home buyers to use IRAs for down payments on homes.
