Fueled by the lowest mortgage interest and unemployment rates since the 1960s, national homeownership soared in 1998 and probably will continue increasing for the next decade, according to a new study.
``The state of housing in America is very, very good,'' said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, which was releasing the study today.
The study found that about 1.8 million homes have been built each year since 1996, and that the national homeownership rate reached 66.3 percent last year.
Most of the growth has occurred outside of cities and in the South and the West.
The report says that increases in immigration and in the number of young or newly formed households will fuel a continued increase in the housing market for the next decade.
At the same time, baby boomers becoming senior citizens are expected to help sustain the home remodeling market as they revamp their homes, the report said.
At the same time, however, the housing boom hasn't done much for minorities and the working poor.
Although more minorities are buying homes because of low interest rates and specially tailored mortgage loan programs, the gap between white and nonwhite home ownership widened from 1994 to 1998, the study found.
Education is a factor in that gap.
For minorities, the likelihood of becoming a homeowner increases dramatically with the completion of a bachelor's degree, Retsinas said.
In addition, the report says, the brisk housing market has also driven rent prices upward, causing problems for the working poor and those newly off of welfare.
Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
``For no state in the nation could a household with one person making $7 per hour working 52 weeks a year be able to pay for a two-bedroom apartment without exceeding the 30-percent-of-their-income standard,'' Retsinas said.
``Housing policy has been predicated on the premise that if you work, you will be able to afford housing,'' he added.
``The whole housing policy is brought into question.''
