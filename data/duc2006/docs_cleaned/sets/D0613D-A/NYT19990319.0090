He should know.
As director of the Peace Corps for 3 1/2 years, he's shoveled thousands of Peace Corps volunteers off to the backwaters of the planet.
These are not plush Club Med vacations, but two-year commitments, often in the Back of Beyond, to work with folks at ground level who usually have little in the way of tools but their hands.
``This fall we'll have 7,400 volunteers abroad that's the highest number in 25 years.
Right now we have 6,700 in 80 different countries.
We're making a big push to get up to 10,000 volunteers.
So for those who paint the young people of `Gen X' or `Gen Y' as slackers, we don't see that.''
Nor, apparently, does the Congress, which two weeks ago approved money to expand the Peace Corps, a rare show of bipartisan support for a Clinton initiative.
Flying to Boston first thing on the morning after the White House St. Patrick's Day bash, Gearan, the Gardner native who was deputy chief of staff and White House communications director in Clinton's first term, clicked off his agency's growth rings: ``Four years ago we had 100,000 inquiries a year.
Last year we had 150,000.
Friday night in Symphony Hall, the Handel Haydn Society of Boston and New Heritage Music Foundation will present ``Celebrating the Voice of Peace,'' to commemorate the Peace Corps's founding 38 years ago by President Kennedy.
David McCullough, the author and PBS broadcaster, will narrate from writings of JFK and his favorite poets.
``I'm praying the pianist gets sick,'' cracked Gearan, a saloon piano player of some note.
The Handel Haydn Society approached him two years ago about celebrating Kennedy's Peace Corps scheme, he said.
The oratorio composed by Dan Welcher is the first work commissioned by the Society in 20 years.
There will be a 3 p.m. Symphony Hall matinee performance Sunday.
From its creation in 1961, the first year of JFK's 1,000-day presidency, the Peace Corps was a beacon of optimism and neighborliness that has served the country well.
So far 152,000 Americans volunteered for short money and long hours in remote spots which needed a school, a well, a Ground Zero health program.
There are 38 American volunteers who'll rendevous in Symphony Hall and fly out Saturday to Senegal in West Africa.
``There is certainly the same sense of travel and adventure in today's volunteers that we've had since '61,'' said Gearan, ``but now they're getting their experience in the global economy.''
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is a Peace Corps alum, as are Senator Chris Dodd and five congressmen, three of them Republicans.
Unlike the $30,000 to $50,000 college bonuses the military uses to lure high school-graduating recruits in this almost-full-employment age, the Peace Corps's applicant pool is average age 28, almost all of them recent college graduates.
Once selected, they get a get a modest monthly stipend to live on, plus full health insurance, and deferments on college loans, if any.
On completing their two-year stint, they get a readjustment allowance of $6,000.
Gearan in the past month was in Africa and Latin America with Clinton.
``In Tanzania I sat with Charlie Stith (the Boston minister who is US ambassador there) and the Tanzanian prime minister, who said the first American he ever met was his Peace Corps teacher.
You hear that all over Africa and the Third World.''
But not all idealists are young people.
One volunteer out of 12 is over age 50.
Massachusetts furnishes more volunteers than all but four other states, said Gearan.
Among the top 25 colleges feeding the Peace Corps are UMass, Tufts, Smith, Williams, BU, and Gearan's alma mater, Harvard (he is class of '78).
Gearan started a new Crisis Corps, to recruit former volunteers to go back for short stays to countries hit by natural disaster or humanitarian crises.
``In Honduras on the last trip, we have one guy who's an engineer on the Central Artery project here.
He's taking two months to go back to Honduras to help out after Hurricane Mitch.
He's a perfect example of a guy who's been there; he can go in and literally on Day One be ready to make a difference.''
Elaborate efforts are made to furnish volunteers with training, language skills, and medical precautions.
Not one volunteer has been kidnapped, and ``safety and security are our No.
