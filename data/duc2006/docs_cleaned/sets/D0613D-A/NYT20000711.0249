Blame.
Limp surrender to the Fates or impersonal forces beyond his control, be they The Man, The System or The Economy.
``None of this was anybody's choice but mine.
No matter how impressionable or naive I have been, it has always been my decision.''
For Jacob Leverich, 18, a freshly minted high school graduate who holds down a sophisticated job at a high-end computer graphics company, pragmatic faith in self is a mantra.
``If I fail, it's my responsibility to get back up and back in the game.''
Riding the wave of technological innovation and economic expansion is a back-to-the-future ethic that emphasizes individual initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and attitude of youth.
In a land where Jerry Springer is a minor deity and the culture of complaint, alibi and blame is so strong that a conservative commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such unadulterated blasts of personal responsibility are bracingly refreshing.
``We're moving in the direction of putting a greater emphasis on personal responsibility rather than blaming fate or the social structure,'' said Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at the Camden, N.J., campus of Rutgers University.
``There's been a shift in societal attitude away from blaming the system and looking for blame in the individual.
It's moving in a direction back toward a more positive view of what you can do rather than complaining about how the system is broke and what you can't do.''
The trend is particularly pronounced among the age groups represented by Leverich and Williams, experts say.
And this provides sharp generational contrast with the graying Baby Boomers just ahead of them on the march through life.
Self-reliance is the common thread between kids like Leverich, at the leading edge of what some sociologists call the Millennium Generation, and young adults like Williams, who is at the tail end of Generation X.
Experts note that Xers manifest this cross-generational trait with a decided cynicism and sense of isolation, while Millennials are more optimistic and more likely to band together.
Remember, though, that this is vague and mushy sociological stuff, lacking the absolutes of atomic physics.
Generation X is an exceedingly broad monicker for anyone born after the Baby Boom and before the Class of 2000 just now leaving high school.
But polls back the notion of generational differences in outlook about responsibility, self-reliance and the power of individual effort.
In contrast, only 71 percent of those between 30 and 49 believe this.
The same survey shows the younger age group also has the strongest belief in the power of the individual: 84 percent of those 18 to 29 think everyone has the inner strength to succeed in life; only 77 percent of those between the ages of 50 and 64 and 70 percent of those age 65 and older believe this.
Xers and Millennials are also linked by matter-of-fact low expectations about politics, government, corporations and other traditional social institutions, the pros say.
To the degree that they look to others for support or commitment, it's to a loose collective of friends, family or like-minded peers, or non-traditional organizations like non-profits.
They believe in action over words, movement toward a goal rather than discussion of an idea.
In a series of books with co-author William Strauss, Howe argues that American history has been strongly influenced by a cycle of generational traits ranging from idealism to alienation.
Boomers were idealistic until Vietnam, Nixon, the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr. and the economic upheaval of the '70s and '80s made them disillusioned and inward-looking, Howe said.
Xers are alienated and isolated, taking as a given the empty promise of traditional societal institutions like family and government, arming themselves with the cynical belief that they're on their own.
Howe said the most motivated of this generation turn lone-wolf cynicism into individual action that has positioned them to take advantage of the current economic expansion; those who don't are slackers, missing out on the boom's big ride.
``This is a very libertarian generation,'' Howe said of the Xers.
``They believe you take care of yourself, that you rely on yourself and your platoon, your surrogate family.
The take was: Life can be cruel, you have to deal with it on your own.''
Still a work in progress, the Millennials are just emerging from high school.
They exhibit the most optimism about the future, a by-product of growing up in nothing-but-good economic times, in an era of renewed emphasis on protecting kids from the ravages of broken homes and other societal forces.
If that combination persists, it's Howe's belief that the Millenials will take on the mantle of the World War II generation and their unstinting belief in duty, honor and country.
Much of this rings true to Jackson Pace.
The teacher and technology coordinator at Lyndon Baines Johnson High School in Austin, Texas, works closely with the teen computer wizards in the school's special science and technology program, including Jacob Leverich.
The Millennials in his program are technologically savvy, confident that their computer skills are a bankable backstop for the future.
``There's no overriding fear that they can't whip it, they can't overcome it,'' Pace, 43, said of his students.
``These kids have a full toolbelt of skills.
They analyze quicker, they assess need quicker, they pull the tool, get it done and move on.''
Pace, a Baby Boomer, contrasts this with his own approach to issues: ``I have to know that it's OK, know that you think it's OK, and I want to talk to you about it being OK. We'll justify our point and then do it.
``These kids process it and get it done with no talk.''
``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was because that yuppie parent had money and they were another possession,'' said Pace.
``And that created a real cynical kid.
``Today's kids really are bubbling up in the last quarter-century as renaissance kids.
They're not money grubbers.
They know they can get the money.
And I'm not sure they're basing their human happiness on cash.''
Leverich echoes this last point: ``What will make me happy is not necessarily making more money.
What will make me happy is to set myself apart and not just be another person off the assembly line.''
Computer competence gives adolescents and young adults a taste of success at a crucial stage of life, a boost they are likely to ride into middle age.
``They see technology as a big part of the future and they're comfortable with it,'' Rafoth said.
``They tend to be individualistic and see themselves in control and not the pawns of giant, impersonal forces.
That's because they haven't lived through a Vietnam or World War II.
They see it as getting what they want out of life and nothing stopping them and technology enabling to do that.''
The flip side of this confidence is an uninformed arrogance, an unwillingness to acknowlege the value of life experiences outside the narrow band of technological competence.
It is the thing that drives boomers to crazed distraction when they confront Xers and Millennials.
``Boomers are into mission statements and corporate culture and creating a sense of community and team play,'' said Howe.
``Xers are much more contractual about work.
`If it's 5 o'clock, I'm outta here.'
They say they bring to the job all they need to bring.
They don't bring all the baggage and expectations that boomers bring.''
Millennials share this transactional attitude about work, but sport it with less of a nasty edge.
``Instead of being the enemy of these corporations, it's just where we go to work,'' said Leverich.
Williams, who sometimes sounds like a world-weary boomer instead of the tail-end Xer he is, buys the notion that his generation believes in self- determination.
But he doesn't see this as something noble.
Deserted by divorcing parents and discredited social institutions, Xers had no choice but to rely on their own devices, he says.
And he doesn't see his generation or the Millennials as any less self- absorbed than the boomers.
As proof he cites the resiliance of conspicuous consumption, wide reliance on the anti-depressant Prozac and the popularity of the public self-confessional.
Still, he wryly notes the grit and high-tech gumption of his peers and the next generation down.
``Maybe it was Steven Spielberg,'' he jokes.
``All of his movies, which we all grew up on, feature kids overcoming problems and saving the adults.
We've grown up with this very surreptitious, but very strong can-do attitude.
``The limitation of my father's generation and his father's generation was to never dare something beyond your station in life.
Today, those self-imposed mental barriers are no longer there.
You can do almost anything and accomplish almost anything you set out to accomplish.''
