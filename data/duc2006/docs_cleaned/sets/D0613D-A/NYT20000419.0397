Workers decry the loss of loyalty from employers.
Employers bemoan the lack of loyalty from employees.
The truth is like that old ``Is it a breath mint or is it a candy mint?''
You're both right.
It's two, two, two truths in one.
No employer guarantees lifetime or even long-term employment.
Businesses downsize, outsource, merge, sell, reorganize, cut costs.
At the same time, workers keep their eyes open and resumes ready or suffer shocked self-pity when they're suddenly searching for re-employment.
This two, two, two truths in one job market underlies Carol Kinsey Goman's consultations with corporate clients.
The Berkeley, Calif.-based author and behavioral-change expert considers the loyalty factor when helping employers attract and retain employees.
At a Kansas City Institute for Management Studies seminar, Goman said employers needed to understand that workers have different perceptions of loyalty, depending on their age and experience.
Those perceptions paint different backdrops for accepting and adapting to workplace change.
Her categories and broad characteristics: The veterans: The born-before-1946 crowd has been through at least one world war and possibly a stock market crash and a major economic depression.
They respect military-model authority.
They save for a rainy day and are accustomed to delayed rewards.
They believe you're lucky to have a job at all, so hold on to it and don't complain.
The baby boomers: The postwar population bulge, born from 1946 to 1964, grew up with anti-war protests, quests for equal or civil rights, and experimentation in drugs and sexual freedom.
Their sheer numbers made tough competition for jobs and for promotions.
They question authority but, in the end, believe that in return for hard work and dedicated service, their employer will notice and reward them with boosts up the career ladder.
Generation X: The group born from 1965 to 1979 came of age in a video world where TV brought information to them fast, with fewer words and more images.
They grew up techno-savvy and are prime picks in the computer-reliant job market.
They saw vets and boomers ousted, knew the ``paternal corporation'' was history, and concentrated on building individual skills, expecting to transfer easily from job to job.
Loyalty goes to whatever project they're personally working on at the moment.
The millennials: This Generation Y, or baby boom echo, born after 1979, is the ``multitasking, twitch-speed'' generation.
Comfortable juggling many things at once and moving on quickly if bored or dissatisfied, they expect constant, instant recognition and rewards.
Accustomed to helping their families make decisions about buying computers and such, they expect a place at the corporate table when decisions are made that affect them.
They don't demand handholding career guidance; they ``want the remote control.''
Unless organizations accept the overarching age-related philosophies of their work forces, the two, two, two truths in one head-butting about loyalty will continue, and everyone will profess befuddlement about what's gone wrong.
