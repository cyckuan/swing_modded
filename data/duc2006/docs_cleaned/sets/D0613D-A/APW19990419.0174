Nissan launched its new Xterra sport utility vehicle Monday, but it didn't simply roll off an assembly line.
Covered in mud, a silver Xterra drove out of a smoking 20-foot backpack to the throbbing beat of loud music as hundreds of Smyrna plant workers wearing ``Xterra looks good dirty'' T-shirts cheered.
``That's how a real SUV should look,'' said Jerry Benefield, Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. president and chief executive officer.
Company officials hope the Xterra (pronounced ehks-TEH'-ruh), Nissan's first totally new product since the Altima in 1992, will help the troubled carmaker boost sales by attracting active, young outdoor enthusiasts.
The name is intended to link images of Generation X and rugged terrain.
This SUV will not have leather seats, but there is an option for neoprene covers, which could be useful to surfers or scuba divers who climb in while wet.
The Xterra has room in the back for two mountain bikes to be placed in vertically, and mounts to hold them.
The optional roof rack can be fitted to hold snowboards, skis, canoes, kayaks and bikes.
And the Xterra has a ``backpack'' on its rear, accessible with the tailgate lifted, to hold a first-aid kit or other gear.
The Xterra goes on sale in early June, priced between $17,500-$25,000.
Nissan plans to make at least 60,000 Xterras the first year, with top production capability at the plant of about 75,000.
In addition to the Xterra, Nissan is also counting on the redesigned Maxima and the Frontier Crew Cab truck to help turn the Japanese automaker around.
Last week, Nissan executives said they expected a $296.6 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31.
The company, which recently entered a partnership with Renault SA of France in order to get a $5.4 billion cash infusion, plans to drop production and slash 5,000 jobs.
But Nissan North American president Minoru Nakamura said sales on this continent are expected to increase from around 630,000 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles to 700,000 for the 1999 fiscal year.
He said the Xterra should bring ``good showroom traffic'' that helps boost the sale of other Nissan vehicles, similar to what happened when Volkswagen began selling its new Beetle.
