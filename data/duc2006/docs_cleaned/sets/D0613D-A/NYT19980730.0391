According to a recent survey, people between the ages of 18 and 39 began saving for retirement at an average age of 25.
That is a far earlier starting age than for older groups, the survey found: People between the ages of 40 and 64 began saving for retirement at an average age of 35, and those 65 and older waited until they were 46.
Louis Harris Associates surveyed 1,000 adults in June for Alliance Capital Management, the money management firm in New York.
But young savers, who can generally afford to invest most aggressively because they don't need the money for many years, are proving oddly conservative in investment choices.
The poll found that only 46 percent of people aged 18 to 29 were using stocks or stock or bond funds in their retirement investing.
And young investors who do own stocks or funds devote only 35 percent of their portfolios to them, on average.
By comparison, 62 percent of those aged 30 to 49 have invested money in stocks or mutual funds.
And these people are putting a greater portion of their money 51 percent into such investments.
The survey also found that 56 percent of those aged 50 to 64 held stocks or mutual funds; on average, these investors also devoted 51 percent of their portfolios to them.
``We were fascinated that Gen X-ers would start saving regularly for retirement earlier than their elders did but keep less of their assets in more aggressive investments,'' said John Carifa, president of Alliance.
The survey also found that retirement savers didn't think they were stashing away enough money.
In estimating how much money they would need to retire with an income equal to 70 percent of what they now earned, the respondents gave a median answer of $196,000.
But the median amount they actually expected to save was just $143,000, a 27 percent shortfall.
