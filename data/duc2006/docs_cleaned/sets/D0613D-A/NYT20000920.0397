In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual guidance.
Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with their parents and teachers to make a ``visible stand'' just before the start of the school day.
The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year.''
Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help everybody be a witness for God.`` ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere.
You got to pray everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.
Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new legislation that bans open religious expression during extracurricular activities including sporting events.
``This event allows us to keep focused upon God,'' said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away.
``He is the answer to all of our problems.''
Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of expression.
``You have the right to freely practice your faith.
That is the foremost amendment in the Bill of Rights.
This is lawful.
This is what the courts say we are allowed to do,'' Mignery said.
According to the ``See You at the Pole'' Website, the event draws more than 3 million participants each year.
The site said the event is student initiated and came out of the desire of `` a small group of teen-agers'' from Burleson, Texas, in 1990.
