China is backing the strengthening of international cooperation in fighting crime involving firearms, especially transnational firearms smuggling.
The point was made today by Li Changhe, the deputy representative of the Chinese delegation, at the sixth session of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
Li briefed the session on how China had tightened up the management of firearms, and the laws involved.
He said China attached great importance to public security and personal safety.
It had adopted resolute measures to fight the illegal manufacturing and smuggling of firearms.
Li, China's Representative to the U.N. Office in Vienna, proposed that concerned U.N. agencies hold expert meetings to find measures of coping with all types of crimes.
He called on the international community to exchange information and coordinate their actions in handling cases and to step up efforts in fighting crimes involving firearms.
