As a reputed local crime boss fights his death sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in China.
``We have asked whether it was possible that the death sentence on convicted Hong Kong people would not be carried out,'' the South China Morning Post quoted a source as saying.
The newspaper identified its source only as a senior Hong Kong security official.
It also reported the source would not disclose China's response.
Hong Kong officials had been working with their mainland counterparts on an agreement covering the transfer of fugitives, mutual judicial cooperation in criminal cases and the return of persons jailed abroad to serve sentences in local prisons, the paper reported.
The lack of such an agreement was highlighted in the case of Hong Kong gangster Cheung Tze-Keung, who was convicted this month by a mainland court in a string of crimes and sentenced to death along with four accomplices.
The Post said the Hong Kong-China talks took place before the trial of Cheung, known by his alias ``Big Spender.''
Cheung's trial was the first such high-profile cross-border case to be heard since Hong Kong reverted from British rule to China last year.
Human rights groups, legal experts and some politicians have criticized the Hong Kong government for not seeking a transfer of the Cheung case to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system and no death penalty.
Many of the alleged crimes were committed in Hong Kong, but the defendants were tried behind closed doors in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.
Meanwhile, Cheung's lawyers are pressing ahead with his appeal, calling for two tycoons who were allegedly kidnapped to testify at an appeal hearing, the Post said.
The tycoons, reportedly Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip Sun Hung Kai Properties, never reported any kidnappings to Hong Kong authorities.
This is the main reason why the Hong Kong government did not have enough evidence to press charges, Hong Kong security officials have said.
Cheung's letter of appeal argues that Cheung cannot be guilty of kidnapping if there are no victims.
``There is no evidence of a victim reporting a criminal case.
And there is no evidence of someone being criminally harmed.
There are only defendant's statements,'' the Post quoted the appeal as saying.
The Hong Kong government has said it was forwarding to China clemency pleas for Cheung and one of his gang members on behalf of their families.
The Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to deliver its ruling on the appeal by mid-February, the Post reported.
