white paper released by the State Council Press Office today says that, during the past year and more, China has taken many measures to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights.
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper says.
It has cracked down on serious criminal offenses in accordance with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human rights and safety of lives and property, it states.
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched, according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout the country sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously endangered public security by committing crimes of violence, crimes involving the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
The severe crackdown on crimes has safeguarded social stability and the human rights of the people all over the country, and won the heartfelt support of the general public, the paper claims.
The paper notes that in March of 1997, China's Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress made amendments to the Criminal Law enacted in 1979.
The amended Criminal Law has 452 articles, an increase of 260 over the previous 192 articles.
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law," "equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate with the crime."
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if an act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law," "all criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that "the severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's crime and due criminal liabilities."
These three principles have further improved China's principle of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants, the white paper states.
It points out that China has paid close attention to standardizing the practice of administrative and law-enforcement departments, so as to protect the citizens' legitimate rights from any infringement.
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
Meanwhile, the number of employees in the lawyers profession national exceeded 100,000 in 1996, who have become a major force in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, the white paper says.
