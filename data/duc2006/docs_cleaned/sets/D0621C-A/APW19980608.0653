The three were identified as Wong Tat-hou, an alleged gang leader; Wong Wan-wa, who is widely known by her Cantonese nickname Fei Mui or Fat Woman; and Lam Iok-im, who is known by her nickname Dai Ka Che or Big Sister.
Macau's district court yesterday ordered the pre-trial detention of the two women on preliminary charges of criminal association.
Both women were taken under police guard from the district court building on the peninsula to the central prison on Coloane island.
Wong is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
On Saturday the police arrested an illegal Chinese immigrant surnamed Ho, suspected of kidnapping and extortion allegedly committed between 1995 and 1996, and a Thai national working as a bouncer in the Heavy Club discotheque, which is reportedly owned by Wan.
The Thai national, whose name was not released by police, allegedly carried an explosive device at the time of his arrest.
Wan has been in pre-trial detention at Coloane prison since 4 May by order of the district court.
He was arrested on 1 May, several hours after a bomb destroyed the car of Judicial Police Director Antonio Marques Baptista.
But Wan has been charged only with being a triad member, not with the bomb attack on the police chief's car.
As part of a major crackdown on organised crime, Macau has set up a special taskforce within the public prosecutor's office and hired half a dozen criminologists from Lisbon.
During a visit to Lisbon last month, Macau's governor, general Vasco Rocha Vieira, called on China to be ``more rigorous'' in controlling its borders with Macau.
China has pledged it will increase its anti-crime cross-border co-operation with Macau in the run-up to the enclave's reversion to Chinese administration in December next year.
