Chinese authorities have broken up a gang led by a Hong Kong man suspected in a string of murders, kidnappings and the smuggling of explosives across the Hong Kong-mainland boundary, reports said Thursday.
China's Xinhua news agency said police working with Hong Kong authorities had arrested 18 members of the gang in southern Guangdong province, which is adjacent to Hong Kong.
While applauding the arrests, Hong Kong papers said there was likely to be more such cross-border crime after the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule last year.
The Hong Kong Standard called on authorities to clarify gray areas of jurisdiction stemming from the case.
Most of the crimes allegedly were planned in China, but committed in Hong Kong.
Reports said the suspects likely would be tried on the mainland, where they could face the death penalty.
Hong Kong newspapers said the gang, led by 43-year-old Cheung Tza-keung, had been implicated in the kidnapping in 1996-97 of tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
Papers plastered a picture of a squinting Cheung, known as the ``Big Spender,'' with a few days' growth of beard on his chin.
Fourteen of the 18 were reported to be from Hong Kong Xinhua said the gang had been together since 1990, and besides the kidnappings were suspected of smuggling 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds) of explosives into Hong Kong; murders in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and robberies of Hong Kong jewelry stores.
