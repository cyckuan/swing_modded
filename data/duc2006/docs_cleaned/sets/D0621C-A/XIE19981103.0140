senior Chinese lawmaker said here today that public security in some areas has taken a turn for the better thanks to comprehensive public-order regulations, but the general situation is still disturbing.
Cao Zhi, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, China's top legislature, made this statement after concluding a legislative inspection tour to Hainan, Jilin and Jiangsu provinces, and several municipalities and autonomous regions.
In a report to the ongoing session of the NPC Standing Committee, he said local governments are basically maintaining social stability and causing people to feel safer by employing measures for years to mobilize community forces and help the police prevent and crack down on crime.
"Especially in coastal areas where there used to be quite a number of public security problems, the general security situation is obviously better," he said.
Without the comprehensive measures taken these years, Cao added, the present security situation would be "much worse".
Nevertheless, crime rates are still on rise; the problems of murder, robbery, explosions, and theft are prominent; prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police raids; and gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are increasing, according to the senior lawmaker.
Chinese police have intensified their fight against criminal gangs and have smashed many in the past two years, but the public reports that gangs are still growing in number and influence, he noted.
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security say that in the first six months this year, police nationwide handled 833,000 criminal cases, up 21.6 percent over the same period last year.
The community-level security network must be spread and instituted all across the country, as surveys have found that those places with poor security are also lax in law enforcement; -- And, most important, leaders at all levels must first become aware of the present situation and remain assiduous in the comprehensive management of public security.
