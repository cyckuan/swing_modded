China is still facing the difficult task of fighting corruption and economic crimes, according to a report recently released by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
The report on China's social situation said that although the Chinese government's position against corruption is firm, corruption, especially bribery, is still widespread and in some places severe.
"From January to September of this year, 756 major economic criminal cases, involving a total of 3.87 billion yuan (466 million U.S. dollars), were reported by China's customs officials alone," the report said.
Some middle and high-level officials have been involved in many of the country's white collar criminal cases, it said.
According to the report, the government will make greater effort to crack down on corruption, smuggling and other economic crimes as well as criminal acts in the new year.
