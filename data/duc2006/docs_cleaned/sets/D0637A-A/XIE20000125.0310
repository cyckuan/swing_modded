People in underdeveloped regions of China will benefit from a project developed by the Canada-based ATS corporation, which is aimed at promoting solar energy technology for generating electricity.
The Canadian federal government will sponsor the project, said visiting Canadian Minister of Natural Resources Ralph Goodale today at a seminar dedicated to meeting China's future energy demands.
The ATS, headquartered in Ontario, is developing special technology for producing a solar-energy board capable of turning solar energy into electricity.
This technology is particularly suitable for the regions that are presently without electricity.
Goodale is currently leading a large trade and investment delegation to China, South Korea and Japan.
"Such high-tech companies as ATS have great potential for cooperating with China and creating economic and social benefits," he said.
