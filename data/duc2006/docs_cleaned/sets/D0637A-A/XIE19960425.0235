Australia will hold its first international solar boat race Saturday.
The entrants are from Australia, Germany and Denmark.
The race is part of the ongoing Australian Science Festival which was launched by Federal Minister for Science and Technology Peter McGauran Friday and will end Sunday.
Race adviser Hans Tholstrup said that the boat race is a most exciting innovation in a world-wide search for renewable energy.
Most of the boats are solar powered, including a lightweight boat specially designed for the race by a catamaran firm in Tasmania.
The 11.2-meter-long boat set a world record recently by sailing 2,500 km on River Murray.
"Compared with solar car, the boat has many advantages including fewer building costs and speedier commercial returns," Tholstrup said.
He said that solar powered boats had a more immediate commercial prospect than solar cars.
"Boats for recreation, fishing or even tourist boats may be used as the sun takes them along for a quiet holiday on a lake, river or dam.
Even ocean travel is not excluded.
"The other great value of alternative energy boats is that they are minimum pollution boats.
Waterways restricted previously to human use or to sail because of pollution may be opened up to them," he said.
David Gray from AMSA said that the race provided his company with an opportunity to take advantage of emerging technologies, especially those that solve real world problems.
"We are specially mindful of the need to develop renewable energy and power sources that effectively protect the marine environment," he said.
Australia is leading the world in a number of areas of solar energy research and application.
The University of New South Wales has developed the most efficient ultra-thin solar cell in the world.
The University of Sydney holds the record for the best-performing high-tech material for solar thermal electricity.
