Schoolchildren in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been given a practical lesson in solar energy.
For the pupils from Hexigten Banner, winter months meant cancelled classes because the cold was too unbearable.
They have been rescued from the big freeze by the power of the sun.
Nearly 10,000 square meters of classrooms with solar energy heating system have been built, saving students from the cold.
The banner has become a model area in the region in the development of solar energy.
It has vowed to install solar heaters in all classrooms in the rural or pastoral areas within five years.
Solar energy has been widely applied in the life of farmers and herdsmen in all parts of the region.
So far, 4.42 million square meters of residences for human beings and shelters for domestic animals have been built, according to the regional new energy office.
Solar energy is even used in the area 49 degrees north latitude, it said.
Inner Mongolia has plenty of solar energy potential, with each square meter of space receiving energy up to 1,779 kilowatt hours annually, second only to Tibet in China.
Abag Banner has built nearly 4,200 square meters of houses heated by solar energy since 1986.
Temperatures are as low as 44.2 degrees below zero centigrade, but temperatures inside the herdsmen's houses stand above 15 degrees centigrade.
Experts said that solar energy houses are undoubtedly the best choice to help migrating herdsmen to settle down.
Solar energy is also used to raise domestic animals.
Bairin Right Banner has built 700,000 square meters of shelters for domestic animals.
It is calculated that by introducing solar energy, income from raising each cattle can increase 500 yuan (about 60 US dollars), while income of raising each sheep or goat can increase 100 yuan.
