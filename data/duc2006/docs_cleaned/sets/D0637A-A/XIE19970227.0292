The two-day seminar on solar energy ended here this evening after discussing how to develop and apply solar energy in the rural areas in Africa.
Minister of Scientific and Technical Research, Bava Djingoer, urged the experts to design specific projects and concrete recommendations on the use of solar energy especially in remote villages.
The basic aim of the request is complementing conventional energy with solar energy especially for lighting.
The seminar was attended by 40 participants coming from African and European countries.
Research in solar energy and its eventual application began in the central African country of Cameroun in 1980.
