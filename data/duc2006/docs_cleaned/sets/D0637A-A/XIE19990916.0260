new solar energy air- conditioning project in Rushan City in east China's Shandong Province has passed appraisal by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the energy institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
This demonstration project, the largest of its kind in China, was created by the Beijing Solar Energy Lab, and replaces conventional fuels with solar energy to help protect the environment.
Compared with conventional compression air-conditioners, the project can save about 60 percent in electricity use per year, experts say.
The project has a large solar receiver which operates over an area of 540 square meters and can provide 100 kilowatts of heating or cooling capacity.
In spring and autumn, the system can also provide 30 tons of hot water for households daily.
