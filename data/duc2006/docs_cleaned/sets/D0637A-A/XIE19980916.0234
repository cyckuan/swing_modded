solar panel manufacturing plant will be completed construction in six months in the capital city of Lusaka, the government-owned Times of Zambia said Wednesday.
The paper quoted the company's director Vic Ranchhod as saying in Lusaka Tuesday that the plant, which will cost one billion Kwacha or 500,000 U.S.
Dollars, will manufacture solar panels to facilitate provision of solar power to the Zambians.
With an initial capital of 400 million Kwacha (about 200,000 dollars), the firm has already provided solar energy systems to 36 of its 120 customers who have made enquiries in the last 10 weeks.
Apart from power installations, the company will also sell solar panels, inverters and batteries which have been imported from South Africa, according to Ranchhod.
He said plans to appoint local agents in other provinces are underway.
