Vietnam is to accelerate the development of renewable energy in remote regions in a bid to have 70 percent of its population in mountain areas covered by the national power grid, the official press reported today.
The energy sources include solar energy, wind power, hydro-electricity and gas generated from biological materials.
Southern regions in Vietnam have the advantage to develop solar energy.
Cu Chi, in the outskirts of the Ho Chi Minh city, is the first locality in the country to have used solar power, reports said.
In the north, though the use of solar energy is limited in winter time, solar energy has been used in water heating for nurseries, hospitals and families, according to reports.
In 1997, more solar power stations are planned for mountainous and remote areas where the national power grid cannot reach in the near future.
