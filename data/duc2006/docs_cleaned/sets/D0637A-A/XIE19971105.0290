Germany today announced its plan to considerably expand its production capacity of solar cells and modules in a bid to replace the United States as the world No.1 provider of solar technology.
Under an agreement signed today by German Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers and local governments of two western German states, the German federal government would provide financial support to set up a large solar cell factory in Gelsenkirchen in the Ruhr industrial area.
Large capacity expansion is also planned at an existing solar cell factory in the state of Bavaria.
With the help of the new production capacities, Germany would be able to cover about one third of world demand for solar technology in the future, Ruettgers announced.
Under a study conducted by the German Shell company, solar energy is likely to cover 40 to 50 percent of the world energy demand in about 20 years.
The current expensive production costs of solar energy are also expected to be halved within five years through the application of new technology and mass production of solar cells and modules.
