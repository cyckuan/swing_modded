Unless local school parent councils vote otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once they get home.
Dressed in a calf-length red velveteen coat over a black Amityville T-shirt, calf-high boots and with a casket-shaped purse slung over her shoulder, Melrose High school senior Erica Muxie was horrified at the thought of uniformity being imposed upon her.
