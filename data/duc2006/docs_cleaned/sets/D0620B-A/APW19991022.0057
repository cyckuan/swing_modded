New software that helps highlight school trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year.
Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track incidents of school violence and other crimes.
``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,'' president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the company's Greensboro headquarters.
``And they need to have information available to them quickly.''
Once the appropriate data is entered, the program helps users identify potential problems and repeat offenders.
It tracks incidents by category, including offender, victim, weapons and location.
Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school principal asked him to help identify places in the school where crime was a problem.
The principal thought the biggest problems were in the gym and cafeteria.
But after using the GBA software, Bateman found the hot spots were in the hallways.
``The principal used the information to justify shifting more resources to those areas, knowing that his decision was based on valid statistics instead of a hunch, or a quick reaction to one or two incidents,'' Bateman said.
While school safety measures such as metal detectors or additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the cost of the software to be less than $2 per student.
So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are using the software as part of their security programs, according to GBA Systems.
And others, including the New York City school district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the problem of school violence.
School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting of campus crime would help administrators get a better understanding of the problems they face and allow for early intervention.
``This is something we have encouraged for several years,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif. ``You cannot deploy resource officers to a particular school until you can see the problems.''
Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe Schools in Berkley Springs, W. Va., also saw merit in the software's ability to spot potential problems.
Students who were isolated or withdrawn were prone to being picked on by other students, he said.
``This bullying was a common factor in all five cases and also at Columbine,'' he said.
``It should not be used as the basis for expulsion, but it can be used in determining if someone needs additional help.''
Blauvelt said schools need to be careful however about possibly violating a student's rights.
``There's a fine line,'' he said.
``Just because someone is withdrawn does not mean they are violent, but the student needs help to become reattached with the school community.''
Systems' Ms. Stone is quick to point out the software is not a panacea.
