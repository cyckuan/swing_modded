until he pulled a knife from his pocket.
And then came a machete.
And another.
He drew a handgun from a front pocket, and three more from his waistband.
He reached down his baggy pants leg and up came a rifle.
By the time Chris Dorn's pockets were empty, an arsenal lay before the high school sophomore.
And the audience of school, police and emergency officials had a better idea of what they face in their efforts to keeping schools safe.
``He can double the number of weapons just with a jacket on,'' Michael Dorn, school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council.
More than 200 people came to learn about school safety in the town where in December, a 13-year-old boy shot four students outside Fort Gibson Middle School.
It was the country's third school shooting of the year.
In May, a 15-year-old boy in Conyers, Ga., wounded six students.
And in April, two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., shot 12 students and a teacher to death, before killing themselves.
While schools cannot ensure safety, they can enact strategies that make schools safer, he said.
Dorn, who works for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said enforcing dress codes and reducing ``triggering behaviors'' such as fights and bullying can help make a difference.
Schools also have used random locker inspections and surprise classroom searches to foil potential acts of violence, he said.
He also discussed creating emergency plans for schools that would include everyone, from the local police to the school bus drivers.
Fort Gibson already had a crisis plan when the December attack took place.
The district has since started using a metal detector at special events, added security cameras and limited building access, Superintendent Steve Wilmoth said.
``Just being mentally prepared can help,'' Wilmoth said.
