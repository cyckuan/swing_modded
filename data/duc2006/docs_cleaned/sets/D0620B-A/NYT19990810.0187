Despite a well-publicized spate of school shootings, the number of students expelled for bringing a gun to a public school dropped nationally in the 1997-98 school year, the U.S. Education Department reported Tuesday.
Expulsions for gun possession dropped by as much as 31 percent, although inaccurate or incomplete data submitted by some states made precision impossible.
As many as 5,700 students in 1996-97 and roughly 3,900 in 1997-98 were expelled for bringing a firearm to school.
In the most recent gun-related expulsions, 61 percent involved a handgun, 7 percent a rifle or shotgun, and the remaining 32 percent another type of firearm or explosives.
``The sharp decline in the number of students bringing guns to school tells us that we are starting to move in the right direction,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley.
The federal Gun Free Schools Act requires states that want federal aid for their schools to adopt and enforce laws that require an automatic one-year expulsion of a student who brings a gun to school.
The report showed that about 57 percent of the expelled children received no alternative education during their expulsion, a policy that the Clinton administration has proposed to outlaw.
The report also showed that the one-year expulsion was shortened on a case-by-case basis for 44 percent of those expelled.
About one-third of those whose expulsions were shortened had learning, emotional or physical disabilities.
Law enforcement officials agree that the decline in expulsions was due to fewer violations, rather than laxer enforcement by schools, according to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
He said the drop was consistent with reports by the Department of Justice of a decline in gun-related violent crimes for all ages in all locations, and by the Centers for Disease Control of a decline in ``violence-related behavior'' by young people.
Holder said the trend was boosted by consistent enforcement of strict rules and by tighter gun control laws.
Another reason, according to school-district security officials who joined Riley for the announcement, is that more children think they might be caught.
The officials said adults and students alike are more likely to report gun-toting students than they were before the mass shootings in Pearl, Miss.

Edinboro, Pa., and Springfield, Ore., and this year in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga. ``The community, they're our eyes and ears, and we can rely on them,'' said Lt. Karen Hall of the Atlanta public schools.
``They'll report anything from a burglary in progress to students being disruptive or being where they're not supposed to be.''

Schools remain the safest place for children, with fewer than one out of 100 murders of children taking place in or around schools.
But many educators either share or feel they must respond to public concerns that crescendoed after a teacher and 14 students died at Columbine High School in Littleton.
``There are a still a lot of school districts that don't know what they are doing,'' acknowledged Jack Martin, chief of police for the Indianapolis public schools.
But this summer, even small districts that felt most distant from urban violence have been trying to find out which ``best practices'' are affordable, he said.
Schools are trying everything from hand-held metal detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras to policies that require transparent bookbags or forbid clothing baggy enough to conceal weapons, the security chiefs said.
Efforts by parents, communities and law enforcement to identify and assist ``red-flag children'' before they commit dangerous acts will do far more to make other children safe, said Edward Ray, director of security for the Denver public schools.
