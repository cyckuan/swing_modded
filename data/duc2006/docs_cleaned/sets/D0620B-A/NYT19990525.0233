In response to the call for additional gun control after a wave of school shootings, the purported gap between arrests and prosecutions has been cited and recited by political figures and others who say existing laws should be better enforced before new gun restrictions are imposed.
It will be a central theme of a House hearing Thursday into new gun-control proposals.
There's just one problem: While plenty shocking, this statistic isn't entirely accurate.
It is true that about 6,000 students were cited in 1997 and 1998 under the federal Gun-Free Schools Act for bringing firearms to school.
But, as the law requires, those students were suspended from school and charged as juvenile delinquents in state and local courts.
And it is true that the U.S. Justice Department prosecuted just 13 people the past two years under the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act, a separate law that prohibits the possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school.
But thousands of other defendants who allegedly violated the federal law, including the 15-year-old accused of shooting six classmates at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, Ga., have been charged or prosecuted under state laws.
Federal prosecutions, authorities say, are reserved for particularly flagrant cases.
The 13 prosecutions have nothing to do with the 6,000 instances of children bringing guns to school, said U.S. Justice Department and White House officials, who complained that gun-control opponents have drawn a misleading, if salient, link between the two numbers to divert attention from the emotional issues of school violence and firearms restrictions.
``If you look at any number in a vacuum, you can find a problem with it,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesman for the Justice Department.
``This is a total smokescreen.''
In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the federal government prosecuted 6,078 gun offenses, the Justice Department said.
State and local prosecutors handled the rest of the year's 218,900 arrests in which a weapons offense was the most serious charge.
With political opponents citing such figures, the Clinton administration's enforcement of existing gun laws is becoming a focal point in the debate over new regulations.
In a speech to the Georgia Republican Party last Saturday, Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, deplored ``a collapse of federal firearms law enforcement.''
At the same meeting, in Augusta, GOP presidential contender Steve Forbes ridiculed the administration's record on firearms violations at schools.
``In 1997,'' he said, ``they prosecuted a total of five.
Last year, they prosecuted eight.
And you can hear the White House spin now: From five to eight, that's a 60 percent increase.''
The House Judiciary Committee is ready to consider a bill supported by the president, similar to one the Senate passed last week, that would mandate background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows and would require trigger locks on all firearms.
But at a hearing on Thursday, the House panel first will ask why Clinton's Justice Department isn't prosecuting more cases.
``We've taken it upon ourselves to federalize a lot of crimes, and it's the Department of Justice's responsibility to see to it that those laws are executed and followed,'' said Michael Connolly, a spokesman for Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.).
``What's the point of passing new laws?
We want to look at how and why these (new proposals) would be prosecuted differently than the current record the administration has put together.''
Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Judiciary member, described the low prosecution figures as ``a major problem for the administration.''
``All this president is interested in is a sound bite, a photo op with a bunch of cardboard cops behind him to show that he's tough on crime,'' Barr said.
``They are more interested in limiting access to firearms by citizens than they are in tackling the misuse of firearms by criminals.''
But a White House spokeswoman said focusing on how many cases are prosecuted is irrelevant.
More important, said Julie Goldberg, a deputy press secretary, is the fact that the number of reported violent crimes involving firearms decreased by 29 percent from 1993 to 1997.
``Enforcement alone is not enough,'' Goldberg said.
``There are other issues that Congress also needs to look at.
That's what the president is hoping to have Congress act on his proposals to prevent crimes and prevent guns from getting into the hands of children.''
