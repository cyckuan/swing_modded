Lawrence Middle School has a bullying policy.
Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around with identification badges.
And in Hamilton Square, guidance counselors are ordered to tell administrators when a student talks of wanting to hurt someone.
School administrators sharing their tactics for averting school violence at a second annual conference Wednesday unveiled elaborate safety plans and said they preferred to err on the side of caution when dealing with threats of violence.
''You can never be too safe,'' said Linda Batz, the principal of Hunterdon Central Regional.
Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve other students, a teacher and themselves in Littleton, Colo., on April 20, 1999, some critics have said that schools have taken zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme.
Sayreville school officials said they would review the district's zero-tolerance policy after complaints about the three-day suspension of four kindergartners who were pointing their fingers at each other while playing ''cops and robbers'' in the playground.
Six elementary school students in Plainfield were suspended for two days in March after an 11-year-old boy threatened to ''get a gun'' if other children did not stop teasing him.
Joe Duca, a retired police officer who works as a security coordinator for the South Brunswick Schools, said school officials are fearful of not doing enough to stop another Columbine.
''They're afraid of being held responsible'' if a school threat escalates into violence.
Ellen Boylan, an attorney at the Education Law Center who handles students-rights cases, said zero-tolerance policies illegally keep students from receiving educations and don't result in safer schools.
She cited research that concluded harsh punishment for intolerable behavior does nothing to stop the behavior or increase school safety.
Ninety-five percent of school districts in the nation have such policies, she said, and yet suspensions and expulsions have doubled between 1990 and 1997, indicating that students are not deterred.
''In the mind of students, it's overcontrol,'' she said, adding that it may lead to more violence.
Chris Woolley, the principal of Lawrence Middle School in Lawrence Township, said that his school might meet with a parent or a school psychologist about a student threat before deciding upon a suspension.
He might not suspend a student for threatening to shoot a rubber band at someone, for example, but may suspend the student if the spitball seriously injures another person.
''It is incumbent on us all to make reasonable decisions,'' he said.
Jane Hammond, the Jefferson County (Colo.) superintendent whose district includes Columbine, said one of the most important lessons she learned from the tragedy was that student safety isn't a sure thing.
Schools have taken different approaches to the problem.
Lawrence Township's bullying policy bans students from intimidation, use of force or ''habitual or persistent cruelty.''
The school has made efforts to reach out to alienated students, Woolley said.
''Students must feel that people care about them and that they have a voice,'' he said.
Hunterdon Central Regional High School has practiced evacuation drills.
The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns.
The high school recently sent a police officer dressed in a fright wig and carrying a gun case to test the school's response to an intruder.
Some students directed the officer to principal Batz' office when he asked, but Batz said in a second drill the ''intruder'' was reported in two minutes.
Hamilton Square guidance counselors are told to report any threat a student makes in a counseling session to school administrators, said Superintendent Neil A. Bencivenga.
