Despite high-profile shootings at schools around the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.
The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown.''
The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention and resources.''
JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to track it down, you're looking wrong place.
School is about as safe a place as you can put your kids.''
There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school year, the report said.
But In the 1992-1993 school year, 55 shooting deaths occurred.
In 1993-1994 there were 51, followed by 20 in 1994-1995 and 35 in 1995-1996.
Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase ``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994.
The report relied on data from the U.S. Education Department, the Justice Department, the FBI, nongovernment groups that track school violence and newspaper clippings.
It defined deadly school violence as killings of adults as well as children on school property.
For instance, it counted the May 1998 shooting of a speech diagnostician by her jealous boyfriend at Stranahan High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Concern over school violence reached its apogee in March when two boys, aged 13 and 11, opened fire on a crowd of children and teachers in Jonesboro, Ark.
Four students and one teacher died in the hail of bullets.
Similar incidents during the 1997-1998 school year occurred in Pearl, Miss.
West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; and Springfield, Ore.
Many news outlets referred to each shooting as ``an all-too-familiar story'' or ``another in a recent trend,'' the JPI report said.
Members of Congress and other officials ``reacted abruptly to what they perceived to be a huge swing in public opinion,'' the report continued, adding: ``A moral panic swept the country.''
