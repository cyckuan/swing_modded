Could it happen here?
That was a question many principals and superintendents asked last year after a spate of school shootings across the country.
So they increased security, bought metal detectors and surveillance cameras, created profiles of potentially violent students.
But as another school shooting tragedy unfolded in Littleton, Colo., on Tuesday, officials questioned whether any school could protect against such deadly events.
An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa., who had a gun and repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High School after a fellow student told his mother of threats.
William Modzeleski, the Education Department's safe schools chief, said schools have used federal and state money to identify and treat students who need mental health services.
Schools have also gotten more federal money in the past few years.
Six months ago President Clinton held a White House conference on school violence with about 800 educators and law-enforcement officials.
But Tuesday night, he acknowledged the nation had made little progress in solving the violence problem.
``You know there are a lot of kids out there who ... who build up these grievances in their own mind and who are not being reached,'' Clinton said.
``And it's not just Littleton.''
But in recent years, the focus has shifted to school security.
Federal officials still say schools are safe.
In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school.
``There is the perception that schools are terribly crime-ridden.
The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said.
As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools that seem safe to teachers and parents.
In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., opened fire on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four classmates and a teacher.
Students also were accused of fatal shootings in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss.
Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway.
No one was hurt.
Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating students' rights when imposing penalties.
Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of the threat of lawsuits, Modzeleski said.
They have been working with attorneys to develop fair policies.
Deborah Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education Association, said the state's 176 districts set their own policies.
