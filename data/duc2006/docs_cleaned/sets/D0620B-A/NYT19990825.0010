Forget security guards and metal detectors, students and faculty at St. Genevieve High School in the Panorama City community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley started the school year figuring out how to get along with each other better.
Juniors and seniors put away their textbooks to paint welcome signs, write greeting letters for freshmen and learn friendship songs all building up to a surprise for ninth-graders who start school Thursday.
``This is our version of security,'' said Dan Horn, the school's new principal.
You should be teaching educators and kids how to deal with rage.''
It's all part of Horn's dramatic departure from the national preoccupation with metal detectors, surveillance cameras, identification tags and armed guards aimed at preventing bloodshed at schools.
``You might keep guns out with metal detectors, but you won't keep the rage out,'' Horn said Tuesday.
The two Columbine High School students who attacked their Littleton, Colo., classmates left notes that detailed their feelings of alienation.
At St. Genevieve, the goal is to make the school experience inclusive for all students by ``fortifying their hearts'' and creating a campus that values every student, Horn said.
For the first time in years, deeply rooted morale problems seem to have disappeared, students said.
``No one is throwing random insults anymore.
We should have started this way back,'' said 16-year-old Myrel Catbagan.
``On the first day, I thought it would be another boring, stupid day.
But now I really feel like this is my school.''
The juniors and seniors broke into small groups and talked about how to deal with problems that can grow into rage and how to treat every student with dignity and respect.
``We talked about how society creates criminals out of men and boys because we are taught not to express our feelings,'' said 16-year-old junior Muriel Tovar.
``We're learning how to express those feelings and listen to other people who need to talk.''
Some new St. Genevieve teachers at first were skeptical.
``But I'm very surprised with the unity and character building that's going on.''
Sabado has always believed that extra security and metal detectors were just a Band-Aid that does nothing to prevent youth violence.
``Students have issues they need to talk about, and they need to know they can talk to teachers and other students and feel accepted,'' Sabado said.
Joanne Altamira, 16, spent most of Tuesday morning painting greeting posters for the freshman class, with great anticipation of a better school year.
``We don't want anything like Columbine to happen here,'' she said.
``I've got a really good feeling about this school this year.
This year's atmosphere is vastly different.
Students described a years-long atmosphere of strict discipline and an administration that didn't seem to respect students, on top of the lure of the gang and drug culture typical of any urban neighborhood.
Javier Cisneros said in his freshman year he ``hung out with the wrong crowd,'' and met some of his classmates by insulting them.
``But then I changed because I saw I could have so many more friends if I treated them right, and I found myself opening up,'' Cisneros said.
``But after I changed, the old principal and some of the teachers kept treating me like a bad kid.
No one noticed that I changed.''
Cisneros credits Horn with re-creating a positive atmosphere and making students feel important, accepted and respected all this in the first week of school.
``It feels good.''
Cisneros is the poster child for what Horn is trying to accomplish.
``With having these focus groups and being positive, we are setting a new foundation built on character,'' Horn said.
``When you put character and issues of human spirit first, the grades, accomplishments, morale and everything else follow.''
Elsewhere on campus, students and faculty members joined to build their school anew.
They helped janitors clean closets and throw away years of debris.
Horn, who believes in the therapeutic effects of animals on humans, brings his dog, Blue, to school with him every day.
``He was a stray I found at my last school, and I found the kids loved it when he ran around campus,'' Horn said.
``He's been a hit here so far.''
But the rebirth of the campus community is what stands out the most.
``Instead of threatening us not to be violent or bad, the teachers are trusting us with everything ... and they keep trusting us,'' said 16-year-old Monica Monterroza.
``It really makes us want to be better and do better.''
And when the freshmen arrive Thursday, there will be no hazing, ignoring or insults.
Only greetings with open arms.
``We want all of the students to feel the same way we do.
We want to really welcome the freshmen,'' said 16-year-old Jellyn Dungo.
``Everything is fresh this year new coaches, teachers, principals I never thought there could be such a dramatic change here.''
