The stay was granted about 30 minutes before Joseph Stanley Faulder, convicted in the 1975 murder of the Gladewater, Texas, woman, was to be led into the death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville.
Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald broke word of the stay to Faulder, who was being held in a cell a short distance from the death chamber, shortly before 6 p.m. CST ``Far out, that suits me,'' Faulder responded.
``He was a very happy man,'' Fitzgerald said.
``He again thanked the Canadian people and the Canadian media who helped to focus attention on the case.''
That Faulder was notified of the stay only minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution, was ``absolutely abominable,'' said Sandra Babcock, his attorney.
Babcock, who was one of two people Faulder asked to witness the execution, detailed the convoluted series of legal actions to save her client, blasting the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for alleged irregularities in its clemency considerations.
``But half an hour ago, I was saying goodbye to my client for the last time.
He was saying goodbye to his sister and niece, who are here.
He found out about the stay just minutes before the appointed hour of his execution.
That is cruel and unusual punishment.''
Although it had appeared Wednesday that Faulder might escape his date with the executioner based on his claims that Texas' clemency process is unconstitutional, that issue was never raised in the high court, said Doug Danzeiser, an assistant attorney general who handled the case for the state.
Instead, Danzeiser said, the Supreme Court granted the stay while it determines if it wants to hold formal arguments on claims that Faulder's rights had been violated under international law and that prosecutors suppressed evidence at his trial.
But Maurie Levin, an Austin attorney involved in Faulder's class action lawsuit over Texas' clemency process, said some lawyers were speculating that the Supreme Court may well have granted a stay knowing the clemency issue remained unresolved.
Since the only issues in Faulder's case pending before the Supreme Court involved international law and suppression of evidence, it could halt the execution only on those issues, Levin said.
``They may have it in their mind that they think they want to look at the clemency process,'' she said.
