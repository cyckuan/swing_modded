According to the article, ``Serious debate about how the death penalty is administered in America has begun to percolate for the first time in years _ a newly nuanced discussion that is spilling over into Campaign 2000 and will likely dog Bush's campaign from now until election day.''
Dog?
Spill?
Percolate?
These are the telltale verbs of a self-concealing journalist.
Once again, the media are driving a story to embarrass George W. Bush and using the pretense of objectivity to cover it up.
Last year's media-driven controversy was whether Bush had used cocaine.
Reporters kept saying the cocaine question was ``dogging'' Bush, as though the question had a life of its own.
But questions don't dog politicians, reporters do.
That maxim bears repeating amid the current frenzy over Bush's use of capital punishment.
Debates don't dog politicians, much less percolate or spill onto them.
Journalists help decide when to brew those debates and where to pour them.
The press is well out of step with public opinion on the death penalty.
Reporters claim that ``America'' is ``rethinking'' the issue.
But while elite journalists overwhelmingly oppose the death penalty, polls show that two-thirds of Americans still support it.
And while the public's concerns are largely confined to whether some people on death row might be innocent, most journalists oppose capital punishment anyway, either in principle or because they believe its application is racially discriminatory.
They think it's outrageous that Texas, under Bush, has executed more than 130 convicted murderers.
They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by exposing flaws in the Texas system.
For months, out-of-state reporters have scoured Texas for evidence of dubious murder convictions.
Newspapers and newsmagazines have churned out article after article to keep the story going.
In the past month, The New York Times has published a dozen major stories on the death penalty and the Texas system.
The Chicago Tribune issued a press release promoting its front-page investigation (headline: ``Flawed Trials Lead to Death Chamber; Bush Confident in System Rife With Problems'').
The Los Angeles Times sent a reporter to New Orleans to cover a federal appeals court hearing on a screwy Texas case.
When appellate courts find errors committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal.
When appellate courts don't find errors committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal again.
Look at the June 12 Tribune.
While the article on Page 7 protests that two-thirds of the nation's death penalty cases ``were thrown out by higher courts or sent back for reconsideration,'' the article on the front page (''Justices Prove Reluctant to Nullify Cases'') protests that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals often fails to ``acknowledge holes in the prosecution's case.''
To obscure their zeal, journalists invoke the passive voice.
``New questions are being raised about capital punishment,'' says a CNN report.
``Texas Lawyer's Death Row Record a Concern,'' adds the New York Times.
Whose questions?
Whose concerns?
Not the reporter's.
Now that Bush is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, the case of death row prisoner Ricky McGinn ``has begun to take on political significance,'' says The New York Times.
Not that any editor assigned the case such significance, mind you.
The case simply ``took it on.''
The Times of London agrees that McGinn ``brought the death penalty issue into the presidential campaign.''
How McGinn performed this delivery from his prison cell remains a mystery.
Every newspaper assault on Bush includes the obligatory ``scrutiny'' paragraph.
The lines hardly vary.
``Texas' death penalty system has come under increased scrutiny since Bush announced his presidential candidacy,'' says the Tribune.
``Texas's vigorous death penalty system is under close scrutiny because of Bush's presidential campaign,'' says The Washington Post.
``With Mr. Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny,'' says The New York Times.
Who's heightening all this scrutiny?
The cases themselves are doing it.
The upcoming execution of inmate Gary Graham ``is the latest high-profile death penalty case to focus attention on Gov.
