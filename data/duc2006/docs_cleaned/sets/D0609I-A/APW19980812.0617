Nearly 6,000 new houses and apartments are under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while close to 3,000 are standing empty, a peace group said Wednesday.
The Israeli government authorized the construction despite the United States' call for a freeze in settlement expansion.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units under construction.
They also found 2,888 fully built housing units standing empty.
There are currently 42,000 housing units in the West Bank and Gaza, Peace Now leader Mosi Raz said.
The new building will increase the number of units by 15 percent, he said.
Last year, Peace Now counted 5,200 houses under construction.
``These counts prove, for the umpteenth time, that this government is pro-settlements, that building is steadily increasing and that there is no thought to the consequences,'' Raz said at a news conference.
Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza.
The Palestinians charge that expansion of the settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace settlement.
Peace Now teams visited every settlement save two.
They were prevented from entering the Itamar settlement by residents who confronted them at the gate, blocking their way in.
One settler was detained on suspicion of striking a press photographer traveling with the group.
The survey teams chose not to enter the settlement of Itzhar, where residents are still in mourning following the murder of two settlers there last week.
Israeli troops detained two Palestinians from a nearby village in connection to the killings on Tuesday.
Israel's Housing Ministry claimed that only 220 of the units under construction were government-funded.
Any other building was private, ministry advisor Moshe Eilat said.
However that statement was refuted by both Peace Now and Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, who both said that close to two-thirds of all housing units in the West Bank and Gaza were publicly funded.
All building in the settlements, public or private, must be approved by the Defense Ministry before it can go ahead.
Statistics Bureau figures from April the most recent month available reported 3,410 units under construction, of which 2,290 were public.
The Bureau's figures are based on reports provided by the settlements themselves and on estimates based on statistical models.
