In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and planned for high-tech industry.
Netanyahu's tour came only one day after a senior U.S. envoy publicly slammed Israel's intensified settlement activities in the West Bank in recent months.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
Ehud Barak, his main rival in the May elections for prime ministership, accuses Netanyahu of giving in to Jewish settlers to ensure their support for his power.
During his visit to the industrial park, Netanyahu asked some 100 settlement leaders to work for his re-election.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military area and ordered them to leave.
