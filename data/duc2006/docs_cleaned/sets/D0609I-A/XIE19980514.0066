Israeli Foreign Ministry protested on Wednesday against the European Union's decision to boycott settlement products from Israel by imposing heavy customs duties.
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the EU decision is "unfair" and would be "harmful" to reviving the Middle East peace process.
The EU on Wednesday decided to ask all its 15 members not to exempt customs duties for products made by Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
These include agricultural products, processed foods, wines, flowers and others.
The statement accused that the EU's decision violated the trade agreements signed with Israel, which give partial or complete exemption from customs duties to Israeli products of these categories.
The EU said that the occupied territories are not part of Israel, and therefore the settlement products would be subjected to heavy customs duties.
In April, EU threatened to imposed customs duties on products from Israeli settlements.
Israel was making diplomatic efforts to block the EU move, which it regarded as a grave threat politically rather than economically.
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Gaza alone the number is 19.
The settlements which encroach on ever-more Palestinian lands, are armed enclave constantly guarded by Israeli soldiers who often outnumbered the settlers themselves.
