The finance committee of Israel's Knesset agreed Wednesday to allot 20 million shekels (5 million U.S. dollars) for the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
The committee said the money was required because of the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and it would be used for infrastructure work in order to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
The decision came one day after the Knesset ratified the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord with a landslide majority, paving the way for the start of Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
The accord signed last month in Washington envisages that Israel withdraws its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return for tougher Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
On Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged settlers to grab as much land as they can before Israel begins its troop pullback.
Palestinian officials described Sharon's remarks as "a declaration of war," and the U.S. state department criticized the foreign minister of "undermining trust and confidence" between Israel and the Palestinians.
Without directly calling for a freeze of settlements expansion, the deal stipulates that the Israeli and Palestinian sides should refrain from taking any "unilateral step" to change the status quo of the West Bank.
But Israel holds that its policy to expand existing settlements has nothing to do with the agreement.
Meanwhile, Israeli police removed Jewish settlers occupying a remote hilltop west of the Kedumin settlement in northern West Bank.
Four settlers were detained and the mobile homes they set up were demolished.
But the settlers vowed to come back repeatedly.
The settlers began to establish mobile rooms near the hilltop Monday, a day after Sharon' remarks to encourage them to seize more land.
