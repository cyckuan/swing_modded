Israel's Housing and Construction Ministry has issued 2,600 new tenders for house constructions in the settlements of the West Bank, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
All those tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, and others for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the Radio quoted ministry officials as saying.
Ma'aleh Adumim is the largest settlement situated just east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
It is called city instead of settlement now.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestinians during their final-status talks which have been launched September 13.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in his U.N. address on Wednesday has asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, no matter what happens in the future.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he would, like the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, continue to expand it.
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem," which has triggered sharp criticism from the Palestinian side.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, said that the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is "evacuation."
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
