In a show of solidarity with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's Arab community on Friday announced a boycott of 120 goods made in Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West Bank and Gaza, and fear independence will be increasingly difficult to attain with the expansion of the Jewish settlements.
Israel's nearly 1 million Arabs often have split identities.
While citizens of Israel, many also support the aspirations of their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.
The decision to boycott settlement products was made by a group of Israeli Arab leaders, including legislators and mayors, on Thursday.
Starting Monday, a list with 120 products to be boycotted, including ice cream, canned foods and sweets, will be posted in Arab-owned shops and published in Arabic-language media, Ahmed Saad, a member of Israel's parliament, said Friday.
``We expect that the citizens will fully comply with the boycott because they are politically aware of our goal,'' Saad said.
Jewish settler leaders said they might retaliate by not employing Arabs in the settlements.
About 17,000 Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza as well as thousands of Israeli Arabs work in the settlements, the Jerusalem Post daily said.
