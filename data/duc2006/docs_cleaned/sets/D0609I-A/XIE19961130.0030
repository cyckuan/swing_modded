The Palestinian Authority (PA) has accused the Israeli settlement policy of aiming to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and isolating Jerusalem from the West Bank through building new Jewish settlements.
The PA made the accusation in a memorandum to be presented to an emergency session of the Cairo-based Arab League due to start Sunday.
The extraordinary meeting of the league's 22 permanent members, called at the request of Syria and the PA, will discuss new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
The settlement issue has underlined the trend of the policy adopted by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, said the document.
Palestinians, infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more Jewish settlements, complain that the Jewish settlements have broken up the territories between their main cities and diminished their chances of establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The memorandum reviewed the Israeli policy regarding Jerusalem, settlements, confiscation of Palestinian lands, and pushing Jewish immigrants in Jerusalem to the holy city of Judaize.
It also noted the fact that Israel has earmarked a huge budget for the settlement policy, while leaving Jerusalem suffering from deterioration in all utilities and services.
It shows that Israel has adopted an extremist policy against the Palestinians and the Syrians in the occupied lands, the memorandum concluded.
