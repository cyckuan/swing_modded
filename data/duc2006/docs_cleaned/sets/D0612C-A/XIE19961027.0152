There are an estimated 1.7 million autistic persons in India suffering from developmental disorder that affects communication and social abilities of people, Welfare Ministry sources said here today.
Autism is known as a "spectrum disorder," in which the severity of symptoms range from a mild learning and social disability to a severe impairment with multiple problems of highly unusual disorder.
It is stated that 20 out of a population of 10,000 in India suffer from the spectrum disorder.
Out of this, 80 percent affected by autism are boys.
The Action for Autism, a non-profit organization based here, is conducting a three-day training workshop for parents of autistic children.
According to the Action for Autism, there are no medical or genetic tests which can detect autism.
Diagnosis of autism is not easy, the onset may occur at birth, or a child may have a period of normal development followed by a deterioration of verbal and social skills around one-and-half to two-and-half years.
