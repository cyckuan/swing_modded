The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary.
But they have generated intense interest because for the first time, a method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies whose brains are still developing rapidly.
Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least 3 years old.
But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition, when the brain is its most malleable.
Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects about 5 of every 10,000 children.
While autistic children appear healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head banging, with no apparent purpose.
Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies who were later found to be autistic.
These infants showed a specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone interview.
But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary.
Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit disorder.
``He's got a very intriguing piece of preliminary data which, if it turns out to be true, will be very important.''
Temple Grandin, a highly functioning autistic woman who is an assistant professor of animal science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and an authority on animal behavior, said: ``He's on to something really good, and I fully support it.
It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism.
But even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3 years old.
Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said: ``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality about autism that has been missed.
We tend to think it's a problem with the mind.
But now that we are really beginning to see how the brain works, we know that the mind is embodied.
Body is part of mind and there's no way to separate them.''
As they recover, he said, they go through predictable stages, for example recovery of movement, that reflect fundamental aspects of brain organization.
Because human babies also pass through predictable stages of development, he theorized that defects in the brain might be reflected in early movements.
He received 17 tapes that showed the babies during major milestones of motor development, including rolling over, sitting, crawling, standing and walking.
He also videotaped 15 normal infants as they passed through the same milestones.
Portions of each tape were analyzed, using a special technique, for subtle differences in patterns of movement.
No two babies develop motor skills in exactly the same way, but the autistic babies show a specific cluster of movement abnormalities, Teitelbaum said.
Some were subtle and others quite obvious.
Normal children may temporarily show some of the same movements.
For example, none of the autistic babies in the tapes learned to roll over like normal children did, he said.
Normal babies use a corkscrew motion to go from back to stomach or vice versa.
Starting at about 3 months old, they first turn their pelvis to one side, followed by the trunk and finally the shoulders and head.
By 6 months, the order is reversed: the head goes first and the rest of the body parts follow, corkscrew fashion.
Some of the autistic babies in the tapes never learned to roll over.
Others did, but in a peculiar fashion, Teitelbaum said.
Starting from lying on their sides, they rolled to their stomachs or backs by raising heads and pelvises.
Then they threw the upper legs forward and toppled over, moving all body segments together.
And unlike healthy babies who usually learn to sit up at 6 months, even while turning the torso or head, some of the infants whose autism was diagnosed later on toppled easily, falling to one side ``like a log'' and failing to break the falls with their hands.
Teitelbaum, who described his findings in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also noted anomalies in the way the autistic babies in the tapes learned to crawl and walk.
Babies typically start to crawl at about the same time they begin to sit, holding their bodies symmetrically with arms vertical at shoulder width, palms on floor, fingers pointed forward.
Thighs are vertical and hip-width apart with knees on the ground and lower legs and feet resting on the floor pointing backward.
Weight is commonly distributed equally on all four limbs.
The autistic children in the study showed an asymmetrical lack of support in the arms or legs, Teitelbaum said.
One baby supported himself on his forearms rather than his hands.
He raised his pelvis high in the air, bird-dog fashion, but could not move forward.
Another baby crawled by scooting his left knee on the floor but used his right foot to push himself forward.
Teitelbaum said that every autistic child showed some degree of asymmetry in walking.
Many tended to shift their weight at the wrong moment, which made their walking appear slightly stiff.
Others kept their arms in a more infantile position, arms extended forward.
Interestingly, many autistic children walk more slowly and with shorter steps, like Parkinson's disease patients whose motor skills are damaged, Teitelbaum said.
Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that develop before birth.
Some researchers think the glitch occurs as early as the 20th to 24th day of gestation, long before women know they are pregnant.
Others believe the injury, which could be a mutation or environmental insult, occurs later on, perhaps in the second trimester of pregnancy.
In any event, researchers say that in autistic people, most of the brain forms normally but that some basic scaffolding of nerve fibers is incomplete or improperly developed.
Because the human brain grows rapidly in the first year of life literally constructing circuits that will last a lifetime this is the best time to intervene.
The goal of intervention would be to stimulate the baby's brain to circumvent the bad wiring or develop connections to compensate for a defect, Donnellan said.
By correcting movements through some form of physical therapy, it may be possible to used feedback to help correct abnormal brain development.
