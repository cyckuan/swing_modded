Many parents of autistic children haven't been happy with Sen. Slade Gorton since he proposed making it easier for teachers to suspend from school unruly disabled children.
Gorton, R-Wash., isn't backing off his position that schoolteachers need more disciplinary tools to restore order in the classroom, but Wednesday he took another step that drew praise from families of autistic children.
Joined by ``ER'' star Anthony Edwards and former Seattle Mariners pitcher Bill Krueger, Gorton and Rep. James Greenwood, R-Penn., said they would introduce legislation to focus more money and attention on autism research, much of which is conducted at the University of Washington.
The bill would set up five centers for autism research around the country.
Most of those supporting the bill have been touched by autism in some way.
Gorton Wednesday for the first time mentioned publicly that he has an autistic grandson; Edwards has an autistic nephew, Krueger an autistic daughter, and Greenwood worked with autistic children as a social worker before he was elected to Congress.
Infantile autism is a severe neurological disorder appearing in childhood that is characterized by an inability to relate to others, highly repetitive play, and language impairment.
Autism is the third most common developmental disorder among children.
An estimated 400,000 people in this country suffer from the disease.
Gorton called autism ``one of the most common disabling conditions with which children are afflicted, but one that the physicians and the scientists and the researchers tell us can in fact be cured, and is not something that we simply must accept.
The University's Center on Human Development and Disability, funded in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is conducting research aimed at early detection of autism and at understanding the role of genetic factors in autism.
In addition to the autism research centers, the bill would create a greater role for parents in the National Institutes of Health funding decisions, a gene and tissue bank of autism materials, and a national autism awareness program.
The bill, which sets aside $40 million for autism research over the next year, was pushed by an organization called Cure Autism Now, which was started by Jonathan Shestack, the producer of ``Air Force One,'' and his wife, Portia Iversen.
