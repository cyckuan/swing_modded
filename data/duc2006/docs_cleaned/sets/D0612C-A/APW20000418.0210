federal investigation of a possible autism cluster here found that worried parents who pushed for the study were right: The neurodevelopmental disorder is far more common here than once thought.
But the investigation stopped short of finding an autism cluster, a higher-than-average rate of the disorder in an area.
Officials said there is not enough data on autism nationwide to say that a cluser exists.
The investigation did find that the water was not contaminated.
Still, a father who led the fight for the study said he's not convinced that there's no environmental cause for the high number of autism cases in Brick or the apparent increase in the disorder around the country.
''I'm slightly disappointed that (the federal experts) aren't staying in town long enough to answer the questions in the community this is going to provoke,'' said Billy Gallagher, a commercial fisherman with two autistic children, Alanna, 9, and Austin, 7.
After the most intensive federal study of autism prevalence ever conducted, researchers said Tuesday that they found a rate of 4 in 1,000 children with autism in Brick and 2.7 in 1,000 with autism-like disorders.
The rate is several times higher than past estimates, although the true rate of autism is controversial because there has never been a nationwide study.
Until the early 1990s, autism was thought to afflict 1 in 2,000 children.
Preliminary data from a just-completed federal study of children in the Atlanta area show a rate of 2-3 in 1,000 with autism.
''The major question for me is whether it's just more prevalent (than previously thought) or it's on the rise,'' as some parents and doctors suspect, said Dr. Eric London, vice president of medical affairs at the National Alliance for Autism Research in Princeton and a consultant for the investigation.
In moderate to severe cases, autism makes it difficult to communicate or relate to the outside world, and drives some to obsessively repeat certain motions, even hurt themselves or others.
Data from California, South Florida and other areas have shown a sharp increase in recent years in children receiving special educational services for autism, and parents in New York's Staten Island and other communities have complained of possible autism clusters, though no autism cluster has ever been documented.
In 1997, a group of worried Brick parents conducted a survey that found a high enough level of autism in this coastal town of 71,000 that state health officials and politicians won federal funding for a comprehensive investigation.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry began investigating in January 1999.
The CDC found 60 children ages 3 to 10 who had autism or autism-related disorders, said Jacquelyn Bertrand, a developmental psychologist at the CDC.
