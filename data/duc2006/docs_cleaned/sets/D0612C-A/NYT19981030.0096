(Distributed by New York Times Syndicate) Autism was believed to be solely a human condition, characterized by a limited ability to communicate and a lack of response to others.
But it seems animals can be autistic too.
Neurologists have bred long-haired albino guinea pigs with the same neurological abnormalities seen in some autistic people.
With these defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for coordination, the guinea pigs developed behavioral traits typical of autistic patients.
The team, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, the University of Rouen and New York Medical College, placed one altered guinea pig known as GS in a cage with a normal one and compared their behavior and social interaction, such as sniffing, licking and mating attempts.
They found that the GS guinea pigs were much less inclined to interact with the other animals, and showed a reluctance to explore or respond to their surroundings all behavior that can be found in autistic children (European Journal of Neuroscience, vol.
Jean Caston, a member of the team, says that an animal model for autism could be useful to understand the condition better.
