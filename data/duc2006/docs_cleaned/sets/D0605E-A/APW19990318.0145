Vioxx, the highly anticipated new pain pill from Merck Co. Inc. that promises to be easier on the stomach than aspirin, works well in relieving menstrual and post-surgical pain, according to two company studies unveiled today at a medical meeting.
Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San Antonio, Texas.
The study found pain relief was sustained for at least 12 hours.
In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain relief as ibuprofen.
The dental study also showed one 50 milligram Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours.
Ibuprofen must be taken at least three times a day.
Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain medications which work as well as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments.
Merck, the world's largest drug company, will be playing catch-up to Monsanto Co.'s Celebrex drug, which won U.S. approval on Dec. 31.
Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, making it the biggest new drug of 1999.
It has also has become the second-fastest-selling new drug in history after Pfizer Inc.'s impotence pill Viagra.
Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans.
It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing how the drug works against different types of pain.
Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks exist even with short duration use, experts say.
Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said getting the acute pain indication is vital for Merck, though the market for the both Celebrex and Vioxx is bigger with arthritis because patients with that condition take pain relievers more often.
An FDA advisory committee meets April 20 to review Merck's application for Vioxx.
