We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength, but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise, arthritis can wake you up at night sometimes with tender spots that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your joints.
I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we do on research,'' says Dr. Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
Arthritis is prone to unproven, fraudulent and even dangerous treatments because so many people suffer from it 40 million Americans today, expected to hit 59.4 million by 2020 and because there are no effective drugs that work long term for everybody.
``People grasp at straws.
Sometimes patients feel doctors don't give their arthritis enough attention.
There must be something better out there, so they go looking for it,'' Rubin says.
Something better in the form of a whole new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that fight pain and joint destruction without destroying the stomach and kidneys made headlines this month.
Cox-2 inhibitors, being developed under the names Celebra and Vioxx, are expected to outsell even Viagra, the impotency pill that became the fastest-selling drug in history.
Cox-2 drugs are not more effective, just safer.
They are easier on the stomach and can be taken in larger doses for a longer time without damage to the stomach or kidneys.
They could be on pharmacy shelves by early 1999.
``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the side effects,'' says Rubin.
Cox-2 drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen.
Anti-inflammatories are drugs that reduce both pain and swelling by neutralizing the enzymes that cause them.
Researchers have identified two types of this enzyme: cox-1, which releases chemicals that protect the stomach against peptic ulcers, and cox-2, which releases chemicals that cause inflammation.
The old class of drugs inhibited both enzymes.
The new class of drugs selectively works against cox-2 enzymes without inhibiting the cox-1 enzymes that protect the stomach.
It's a development that could be worth billions.
Arthritis sufferers spend millions to pay for unproven alternatives because it gives them a sense of mastery over their pain and because they mistakenly believe that traditional medicine has nothing to offer, says Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs for the Arthritis Foundation.
``The problem is, the public's misconception that tends to lump all forms of arthritis into one package, and to assume that it's an inevitable part of aging and nothing can be done about it all misconceptions,'' Conn says.
The term ``arthritis'' includes more than 100 disorders that attack cartilage in the bone joints.
The disease causes pain, swelling and loss of movement when bone rubs against bone after the cartilage has deteriorated.
The best treatment depends on the specific diagnosis.
Among the most common types of arthritis: OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease.
Affects an estimated 15.8 million Americans, mostly over age 45.
It involves the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear injuries, and is most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing joints including the knees, feet, hips and back.
One of the most serious and disabling types, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Americans.
It involves a genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage and bone.
It often leads to crippling deformities in the hands, wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw and elbows.
An estimated 300,000 children in this country have the disease; most have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Affects approximately 3.7 million Americans, causing pain and tenderness at points where muscles attach to bones.
People with fibromyalgia frequently experience fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness and sometimes psychological distress.
It is caused by a defect in body chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes in diet.
TENDINITIS.
Result from irritation caused by injuring or overusing a joint.
Bursitis affects a small sac that helps muscles move easily.
Tendinitis affects the tendons that attach muscles to bone.
It is critically important to first find out what kind of arthritis you have, according to the experts.
``Usually there are lifestyle measures that are very important,'' Conn says.
``If you have osteoarthritis of the knee and you are 20 pounds overweight, that weight is a big factor.
You need to know what exercising, what conditioning you should be doing.''
The earlier that diagnosis is made, the more hope there is for living well into old age with even the most crippling forms.
For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for cancer treatment).
The National Institutes of Health reported last month that arthritis is now the leading cause of disability among Americans older than 15, as measured by federal disability payments.
The surge of aging baby boomers and the growing number of children who have the disease put arthritis ahead of heart disease, the leading cause of disability payments in a similar study in 1989.
More than $65 billion a year in Social Security disability payments goes to the 21 million arthritis sufferers who are unable to work because of their disease, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
In comparison, about $50 billion a year in disability payments goes to 17 million heart disease patients.
