third new drug for people suffering from the pain of arthritis has been approved by federal regulators.
The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
Meloxicam will be marketed under the name Mobic by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories and is expected to be available in early May.
The wholesale price is expected to be $1.98 per tablet and dosage is once a day.
Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx.
Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other pills to relieve pain.
But these can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other side effects, especially in long-term users.
In clinical trials Mobic had a low instance of gastrointestinal side effects, the manufacturer said.
