Orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, a clinical associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine, was skeptical about a commonplace operation performed on the painful knees of older patients.
The patients suffered from osteoarthritis, a crippling, irreversible condition in which the cartilage covering the bones has worn away with age.
It is the major cause of mobility loss among the elderly.
Arthroscopic surgery, in which doctors work through tiny incisions using a ``scope'' to see, is effective in repairing torn cartilage from injuries.
It cannot replace the missing cartilage in arthritic patients; doctors can only wash out the joint and scrape, or debride, the rough spots.
Yet nearly everyone said their arthritic knee pain decreased after surgery.
The question was, why?
In an unusual, groundbreaking study, Moseley and other Houston researchers are comparing actual surgery to phony, or placebo, surgery to see whether the operation really helps or if people simply believe it relieves their pain.
``Are they better because of the procedure or the placebo effect?''
``(Moseley's) argument was, `we don't know why they hurt in the first place, and whether this works.'''
The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which people experience an improvement in their condition in response to a phony therapy, such as a sugar pill.
Scientists have recently begun looking at placebos in the context of surgery.
Initially, Moseley, who is best known as the team physician for the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, was interested in comparing the benefits of rinsing and scraping the knee joint vs. rinsing alone.
He suspected that washing away debris was what actually gave people relief.
When Wray suggested that they also take a look at the placebo effect, Moseley was taken aback.
``We said, `What do you mean placebo?
This is surgery!'''
Moseley said.
``The more we learned about it, the more we realized surgery may have the strongest placebo effect of any intervention.''
Five of the patients received placebo surgery, just three shallow nicks on their skin so their knees would look like the other patients'.
Two years after sham surgery, patients reported the same amount of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real operation.
Four of the five placebo patients said the surgery was so worthwhile that they would recommend it to a friend.
One patient even requested the operation be repeated on the other knee.
``We know from the literature on the placebo effect that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said.
``If the pill is bigger, you'll measure a bigger effect.''
Wray suspects that people get better just from an encounter with a surgeon.
The white lab coat, the dramatic setting, the declaration of ``I'm going to make you better'' have a powerful effect.
In the current study, the doctors are comparing 180 patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center divided into three groups.
The experiment gives patients a shot at a $2,000 to $5,000 procedure that the VA does not usually offer for arthritis because of its questionable benefit.
Sixty are getting their knee joints scraped and rinsed, 60 are getting the rinse only, and 60 are getting no surgery at all.
All of the patients are given a mild sedative and all awake 30 minutes later, but only the ones getting a surgical procedure receive full anesthesia.
Patients will be tracked for two years.
Initially, the doctors met resistance from hospital administrators when they proposed the study.
To answer concerns about informed consent, participants were required to state, in their own handwriting, that they understood there was a one-third chance they would get placebo surgery.
The answer came simply by looking at the question from another angle.
``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor, who helped design the study.
Brody reasoned that the risks posed by an unproven surgical procedure were far greater than those from a sedative.
The study will be finished next year, with results scheduled to be published in October 2000.
If researchers find out the surgery is clearly beneficial, ``we should probably be doing it more than we're doing now,'' Moseley said.
But if sham surgery works as well as or better than real surgery, will doctors recommend that everyone get the placebo operation?
``That's not what we're going to propose,'' Moseley said.
``We'll have to say that as expensive as arthroscopy surgery (for arthritis) is, we probably can redirect those resources in a better way for treatment of arthritis.''
Marvin Gilbert, a VA patient who lives near Cleveland, Texas, signed up for the current study two years ago.
The 67-year-old water-well drill contractor recently completed his follow-up visits and learned he had actual surgery and he's convinced it worked.
Soon, he could jump and run and he didn't care whether it was because of sham surgery or the real thing.
``It didn't matter.
It stopped the pain,'' he said.
