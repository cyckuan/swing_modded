Two universities in the United States said Thursday that they have received a five-year grant to establish a center for the joint study of mind-body interactions and health.
The focus of the center is to understand how the mind influences the development of and recovery from diverse diseases, including infectious diseases, osteoarthritis, early cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, said the University of Pittsburgh and Camegie Mellon University in a statement.
The grant of 10 million U.S. dollars the two universities in Pittsburgh have received was from the National Institute of Health (NIH), which funded four other centers for this initiative.
Prior to the establishment of the new center, researchers at both universities have undertaken individual studies of mind-body interactions and health.
They found that women with increased anger or hostility have a greater risk for coronary artery disease, and people who have a larger support network of friends and relatives get sick less often than those who lead solitary lives.
One study shows that osteoarthritis has the potential to compromise the health of family members as a result of the patient's negative responses to symptoms and the burden of providing emotional support and task assistance to the patient.
At the new center, researchers will study the risk for respiratory illnesses such as the flu which may be affected by the health of an individual's material and non-material relationships.
Focusing on older adults with osteoarthritis, researchers will determine if the patients and their spousal caregivers experience greater health benefits from an educational intervention targeted at both rather than just at the patient.
Doctors will also examine women's perception of stress, their attitude and coping responses as well as physiological reactions to the stress in their lives as potential markers of risk for cardiovascular disease.
Finally researchers hope to learn whether psychosocial interventions can be designed to enhance adjustment and lower recurrence and mortality among women with early breast cancer and to find out the psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms through which the interventions operate.
