One new type of painkiller, known as COX-2 inhibitors, just hit pharmacy shelves.
The drugs appear to be no more effective at fighting pain than traditional anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and aspirin, but offer the advantage of fewer side effects.
That is a major plus for people who must use pain relievers long-term and risk such problems as stomach bleeding and ulcers.
The first of the new drugs, Celebrex, developed by Monsanto's G.D. Searle Co. pharmaceutical unit and co-marketed by Pfizer Inc., was launched commercially last month.
Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters, likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain relievers.
Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn.
The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with constant use.
Unlike NSAIDs, however, they do not interfere with the closely related COX-1 enzyme, which helps build a protective lining in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract.
Searle began selling Celebrex for $2.42 per 200 milligram pill, less than expected but still more than some HMOs might be willing to pay, especially for patients without a demonstrated problem with NSAIDs.
Ziconotide, awaiting FDA approval, has been touted as a potent alternative to morphine in cases of severe pain.
Derived from sea snail venom, it is designed to block calcium channels in nerve cells of the spine, interrupting the flow of pain signals to the brain.
Enbrel, first in a new class of rheumatoid arthritis medicines called biologic response modifiers, soaks up excess ``tumor necrosis factor,'' a chemical secreted by immune cells involved in joint inflammations.
The drug, made by Immunex Corp. of Seattle, was approved by the FDA last year1998cq for use in adults.
New studies show that it may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis.
Neurontin, known generically as gabapentin, is an established epilepsy drug that has been shown to work against hard-to-treat nerve pain from shingles or diabetes.
Tests are underway to establish whether memantine used in Germany to treat Parkinson's disease can ease the pain of diabetic neuropathy.
The drug blocks NMDA receptors, nerve cell sites that help relay pain signals.
