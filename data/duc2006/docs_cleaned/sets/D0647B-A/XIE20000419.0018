The 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Atlanta barred anyone from attempting to remove the boy from the country, extending the injunction issued last week, Associated Press reported.
The court ruling, which could be appealed, is considered a critical step in the international custody dispute that has lasted for nearly five months.
The report quoted the appeals judges as saying that they recognized the government's authority over immigration matters, but adding that "we fail to see how an injunction in the case infringes upon the congressional power."
Elian was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck after his mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the Atlantic.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ruled that Elian belongs to his father in Cuba, but Elian's Miami relatives insist the boy stay with them in the United States.
