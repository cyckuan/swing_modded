Andy Alexander at 202 887-8334. INTERNATIONAL CUBA-ELIAN MIAMI Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where Elian Gonzales is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy's reunion with his father.
The court action could come at any time.
Is this the last hurrah of the exile community as a political force or the beginning of something even more powerful?
The buzz has been that since the death of long-time power broker Jorge Mas Canosa and the arrival of more moderate rivals to his Cuban-American National Foundation, the community clout had begun to wane.
The Clinton administration has managed to play the different groups off against each other more than once.
But now even the naysayers are taking notice of what a motivated exile community can do when truly aroused.
Elian has united this often never-quite-so-monolithic community as never before.
And so far, they've managed to thumb their nose successfully at the full might of the federal government.
Whither the storied Miami exile enclave?

Police staged a pre-emptive raid and closed the headquarters of world finance protests Saturday, saying the aging warehouse was unsafe and claiming they found ingredients to make a firebomb.
The move angered protestors as police braced for the first of two days of scheduled mass demonstrations on Sunday.
Large sections of downtown Washington were fenced off and thousands of police stood ready.
Meanwhile, security teams scoured the building.
It was all part of a three-hour drill on how to escape shootings or explosions, part of a national trend toward protectiveness unequalled since the 1950's, when millions of school children took part in ``duck and cover'' drills designed to help them survive nuclear attacks.

With Earth Day fast approaching, Vice President Al Gore faces a situation here that could test his environmental credentials.
The Mills Corp. of Virginia, whose executives and associates have given $43,000 to the Gore presidential campaign, want to develop a shopping center on 90 acres of wetlands in the Meadowlands here.
But the mall project is opposed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a prominent environmentalist who has endorsed Gore as ``the strongest environmentalist running for the White House since Teddy Roosevelt.''
The Meadowlands Mills project has thus become a possible litmus test for Gore's environmental agenda.

Now that it's becoming clear that the tropical Pacific Ocean's inability to make up its mind about El Ninos and La Ninas has something to do with the severity of Atlantic hurricanes, atmospheric scientists say an even bigger climate oscillation may be occurring.
Conditions in the north Pacific seem to be switching from ``North Pacific Oscillation 1'' to ``North Pacific Oscillation 2.''
And what that shift lacks in colorful Spanish terminology, it more than makes up for in bad weather: several decades of worse-than-normal hurricane seasons.

Two Gold Kist Inc. poultry processing plants in Alabama that supply chicken to school lunch programs nationwide were overwhelmed earlier this year by diseased poultry, federal investigators have reported.
``There were so many birds condemned they they were filling up the 'USDA condemned' barrel and spilling onto the floor,'' the report, obtained by Cox Newspapers, says of conditions at Gold Kist's Boaz plant.

(Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) COLUMBINE-MAIN The jolt of gunfire that shattered the halls of Columbine High School still splits the air over Colorado's amber plains, roars over purple mountains, drowns the cacophony of its crystal rivers and clatters down red canyons.
Many people, including several who wrote us, have thoughts, hopes, memories and fears about Columbine as we approach the first-year anniversary.

WITH PHOTOS.
Forget all the talk about ``closure.''
The fact is that the students, teachers, friends and families of victims may move on but a sense of loss will always be with them.
How has the anniversary reopened wounds?
How are students and families dealing with the stress of the anniversary?
How have victims of other tragedies, i.e.
Oklahoma City bombing, survived and what lessons might they offer for Columbine?
