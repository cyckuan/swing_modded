Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case, said Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the child to Cuba.
``We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil disobedience campaign,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement.
The organizers cited a ``more positive course'' in the ongoing custody battle over the 6-year-old.
That included a subpoena issued Friday by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House committee and efforts by Elian's relatives to attain custody of the child.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14.
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling.
``First thing that we want to see soon is that the administration is willing to allow this process to take the course of family court, and perhaps also we would like to see the administration more willing to listen to us,'' Sanchez said.
Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian will actually be asked to appear.
In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he?
He is no one.
On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the child is reunited with his father on the island.
In Miami, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives.
Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me.
Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States.
Two other adults survived.
Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that would allow him to seek asylum for the boy.
Elian's father is now his guardian.
Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's ruling, which is expected early next week.
