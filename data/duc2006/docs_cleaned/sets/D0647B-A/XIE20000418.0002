spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Monday demands that the United States immediately return Cuban Boy Elian Gonzales so that he can reunite with his father.
Spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Phan Thuy Thanh made the demand when she was answering a question on Vietnam's latest viewpoint regarding this matter.
She affirmed Vietnam's consistent stance of resolute demand that the United States immediately end the anti-Cuban embargo and strictly observe the Immigration Agreement signed in 1994 and 1995 between the governments of Cuba and the United States, under which the United States pledged to return to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees.
