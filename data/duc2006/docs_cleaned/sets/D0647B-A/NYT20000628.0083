federal court order prohibiting the boy from leaving will expire at 4 p.m. Wednesday, allowing Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to take his son home.
Federal marshals will escort the boy from a suburban Washington home to the airport.
In a terse order released just after noon EDT, the Supreme Court said that it would refuse to review the case.
The high court also refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the country.
Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy, his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor boat.
Elian and two adults were saved after the boat capsized, but the boy's mother, Elisabet, and 10 others died.
In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana home.
But Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him, touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
Elian quickly became the focus of demonstrations on both sides of the Florida Straits.
In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime.
In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son could grow up in freedom.
Others in Miami attached religious significance to Elian's migration to Florida, saying that the intercession of the Virgin Mary had saved the boy and that it would be a violation of God's will to return the boy to a totalitarian regime.
Custody of the boy also became a political issue.
Although a majority of Americans supported returning the boy to his father, Florida may be a key state in the fall presidential election and the Cuban-American community is a potent voting bloc in Florida.
But Elian's great uncle filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the decision of the Immigration Service.
As the court fight dragged on, Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled from Havana to Washington on April 6 with his new wife and their son to take custody of Elian.
Elian's Miami relatives, however, balked at giving up the boy, even after his father agreed that he would not leave the country until the court case was resolved.
When the Miami relatives ignored an order from Attorney General Janet Reno to give up the boy, Reno ordered a raid on the Miami home by armed federal officers.
Elian has remained in the Washington area since he was taken from Miami as the case made its way through the courts.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the denial of the amnesty hearing, but ordered the boy to remain in the country as the relatives filed an appeal with the full Court of Appeals.
That appeal was also denied on June 23, and the Miami relatives were given just five days to win an emergency stay from the Supreme Court.
