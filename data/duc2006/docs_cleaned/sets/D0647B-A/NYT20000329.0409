With tensions rising and officials warning the city may explode in protest, the showdown over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez racheted to an even higher level late Wednesday as officials in Havana said Elian's father could come to the United States.
The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse.
After months of angry rhetoric, Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to come to the United States along with some of his son's school classmates and a team of psychologists to live with Elian until the court battle over the boy's fate ends, CNN reported.
There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials about the proposed trip, and it was not clear if or when the visit would take place.
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ended a tense five-hour meeting Wednesday night with Elain's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, who has cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea in November.
The meeting centered on an INS demand that Gonzalez pledge to turn the boy over for a return to Cuba if the family loses its court fight to keep Elian in the United States.
Immigration officials emerged from their Miami offices about 9 p.m. EST, saying the meeting had reached no conclusion and would resume Thursday.
They postponed until Friday a deadline for revoking Elian's parole, which could mean he might soon be taken away from his Miami family, perhaps for a return to Cuba.
Meanwhile, Miami's Cuban exiles held a huge rally in the neighborhood known as Little Havana.
Thousands of people gathered in the darkness, shining flashlights into the sky and vowing to continue their protests against any effort to return Elian to Cuba.
Earlier Wednesday, more than a hundred protesters milled outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home, chanting, praying and vowing to form a human chain to keep the boy here.
``We are here to show the world that we're united and that we're not going to allow Elian to go back to Cuba,'' said Hortensia Prado, one of the protesters.
In an apparent prelude to what might come if the government moves to take the boy, a convoy of dump trucks chugged down the narrow streets of the neighborhood, horns blaring to the cheers of the protesters.
The drivers vowed to block all the streets leading to the home.
Meanwhile, local officials lashed out at Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton, warning that Miami's Cuban exiles may burst into angry protest if Elian is removed before his court appeals are exhausted.
``They're provoking the community,'' Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said of Clinton and Reno.
``They keep pushing and pushing the envelope and when it explodes, no one is going to be able to control it.''
At a noon press conference, Penelas and 20 other local officials vowed that local police would make no effort to assist federal officers should they try to remove the boy before his court case is finished.
