Bank Palestinian Jihad Mubarak was destined to be a fighter in the war against the Israelis.
Instead, he sells them antiques.
His uncle, a doctor in the Jordanian army, delivered him on May 1, 1948, two weeks before the Arab states attacked the new state of Israel.
Name him Jihad, the uncle ordered.
It's Arabic for a Muslim sacred cause or, in this case, a Holy War.
Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian, but with war coming, it seemed appropriate.
But Mubarak, turning 52 this week, has focused his life on beautiful antiques, cars and, he admits, women.
When the 1967 war began and the19-year-old Mubarak might have fought, the same uncle that delivered him gave a medical excuse out of the war.
Jolly and easy going, the gray-haired Mubarak sells antiques to Israelis, and has never fought them.
His nondescript store, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, is one of the most peaceful spots I've found here, a place where Israelis, Arabs and foreign visitors browse over collectibles from Europe, Syria and made in Bethlehem.

Both the Democrats and Republicans are finding new ways of using these high-tech tools in writing their platforms.

State and federal governments are planning to build an interpretive center in White Hall, Alabama, to commemorate major events of the civil rights movement.
But the government's plan pales in comparison to a proposal for a $47 million rural Islamic complex for the tiny town drawn up by accused cop killer Jamil Abdulla Al-Amin.
