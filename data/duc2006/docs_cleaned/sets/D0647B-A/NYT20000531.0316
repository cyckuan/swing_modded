The network George Bush watched during the Persian Gulf War celebrates 20 years today - 20 years of all news, all the time - even when there's no news to report.
We've talked before about the kinds of problems this presents.
When other networks, such as MSNBC and Fox News, jumped into the 24-hour fray, competition somehow bred idiocy - turning the Elian Gonzales story into a Huge Event, for instance, fueling the frustrations both sides felt until a firecracker became a powder keg.
Yet when gun-toting feds finally burst into the home where Elian was staying, it sure was nice to have the 24-hour guys around so we could see what was happening.
And with CNN, it usually does.
When the space shuttle Challenger exploded, we were glued to the set.
When Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett crawled underneath a table in Baghdad and kept reporting as the city was being bombed, people of my generation got a taste of what hearing World War II radio broadcasts was like.
On the downside, CNN has given us ``Larry King Live'' and ``Crossfire,'' a big honkin' loogie in the eye of the traditional interview show and news-talk roundtable, respectively.
But with local TV news being nothing more than a police lineup broken up with the occasional weather gimmick, it's good to have an option when national news breaks.
And when there's nothing going on?
That's why ``MASH'' reruns exist.
The rest: ``Daydream Believers: The Monkees'' ``Story,'' on June 28 and repeating Aug. 2; ``Out of Sync,'' on July 12; ``Meatloaf: Bat Out of Hell'' on July 26; and ``At Any Cost,'' on Aug. 9.
Great, I guess.
But between this and MTV's insipid programming, where does a guy got to go to see a music video these days?
