Nine-year-old Kaemmerle Fitzpatrick must be a red-scarfed sailor set sail for Roanoke Island, as well as an aproned lady expecting the first English baby in the colony.
She and her sister, 10-year-old Annika, the white-wigged captain, take off for the New World on a lawn chair.
But it's their mother, Freya Fitzpatrick, who thinks of herself as the real pioneer in this suburban Lantana back yard.
She has taught her two girls at home for the past seven years before the home-schooling magazines sold, the Orlando conventions opened, and the trendy (and home-schooled) Hanson brothers inspired widespread teen love.
The Fitzpatrick sisters are two of the 2,240 Palm Beach County students who may sit barefoot at their kitchen desks this year, while their parents put on teaching caps.
Since 1994, their numbers have tripled in Palm Beach County and nearly doubled statewide.
There were 31,440 Florida students home schooled last year.
In Palm Beach County, home-schooled students must register with the district superintendent's office.
State law also requires them to keep a portfolio that can be shown to the superintendent on 15 days' notice.
The rapidly increasing numbers may be due, in part, to new state laws.
In 1996, home-schooled students were allowed to participate in sports and music programs at high schools.
And as of May 1997, they may apply to two-year colleges with merely an affidavit signed by their parent.
The school district doesn't keep figures on how many home-schooling students participate in public school activities or enroll in high school classes, but a few do, said district spokesman Nat Harrington.
The home-schooling community here offers at least six support groups from Boca Raton to Palm Beach Gardens.
They meet weekly for martial arts in Royal Palm Beach; they buy blocks of tickets for Kravis Center events; and they hold their own spelling bees.
There are chess and stock market clubs, field trips to the Space Center and SeaWorld, and special classes taught by parents: How to measure temperature using a cricket.
As the home-schooling community has grown, it has become more diverse.
It is not exclusively white or Christian anymore.
And the reasons parents are choosing it also are becoming more varied.
When state specialist Mary Lou Carruthers started talking to home-schooling parents three years ago, there were mainly two reasons for their choice: They had wanted the little ones to learn about Christ in the classroom, or they worried about drugs, knives and guns.
More and more, parents talk about the latter, the safety issue, she said.
In Palm Beach County, parents also talk about crowded classrooms and they worry their children might not get their teacher's attention, said Beth Kramer, local director of the Florida Parent Educators Association, who has taught five children at home.
Before deciding to home school, Freya Fitzpatrick considered Indian Pines Elementary, less than a mile from her home.
But administrators said no when she asked to spend a day in a kindergarten class, she said.
``If they're not willing to let me see school in action, I'm not comfortable sending my daughter there,'' she said.
Fitzpatrick, who has a master's degree in education, taught five years in public and private schools.
When she first heard about home schooling, she thought it was a terrible idea.
It was presumptuous,'' she said.
But out of desperation, she bought alphabet posters and measuring cups, and then realized she'd have plenty of help.
Her father gives tennis lessons, her former Latin professor advises, and other parents offer geology and Spanish classes.
Not everybody wants to build a Christian child; they might want a non-religious or Muslim child.
That's the nice thing about home schooling, you can choose,'' she said.
For an educator like Fitzpatrick, it's an exciting opportunity.
She can build an entire human being as if she were painting a whole picture, not just the corner, she said.
Their day starts at 8:15 a.m. with violin lessons.
At 8:30, Fitzpatrick and her girls kneel under a homemade time line that notes both Moses and William Tell, and recite the Lord's Prayer.
They belong to the New Church the girls' father and grandfather were missionaries which broke from the Methodists 200 years ago.
The church emphasizes independent thinking, Fitzpatrick said.
Fitzpatrick's schedule, which she plans months ahead, sets out 15 or 30-minute blocks for Russian, Swedish, Spanish and traditional subjects like math and dictation.
When they fall minutes behind, she says, ``We're wasting time!
And that's what life is made of.''
But not all home schoolers are so organized.
``Unschoolers,'' who believe learning should be naturally led by the children, wouldn't have planned classes.
They might spend a week learning about bats, if their children felt like it, and go to the zoo, build a bat house, and read bat books.
During spring break, home-schooled students can take a standardized test, or a certified teacher can gauge their progress by looking at a student's portfolio at the end of the year.
The Florida Parent Educators Association encourages parents to find a teacher who ``understands home-schooling philosophies.''
The students only have to show appropriate progress for their age, according to state law.
The state has never been able to compare the achievement of home-schooled students against public school students, as much as they'd like to, Carruthers said.
One national study shows the average home schooler scores at the 73rd percentile on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.
The national average is 50.
Those results are unreliable because the students in the study were selected by the researcher, a home schooler himself, Carruthers said.
On Monday afternoons, Annika has chemistry she wants to live on a Mars colony some day and she skips around the kitchen wearing safety glasses.
For an experiment on the atomic weight of magnesium, the Fitzpatrick's gas stove must be a home-schooling Bunsen burner.
Annika would be a fifth-grader, if enrolled in public school, but she works at a sixth-grade level, sometimes seventh- and eighth-grade, her mother said.
Socially, she may not be comfortable with her peers in a public school unless they were gifted, she added.
The girls do socialize.
They take karate on Monday afternoons with 30 other students and roller skate on Fridays.
They belong to a New Church youth group, a home-schooling aviation club and 4-H Explorers Club.
When neighbor kids stop by, Annika flops down on the carpet with a board game and offers to teach the competition.
She and her sister work unsupervised for much of the day.
Freya Fitzpatrick wants them to learn responsibility, as well as their spelling words.
Kaemmerle still needs a little help.
Each plastic block holds one flea, according to today's fanciful lesson plan, but Kaemmerle has no idea how many fleas fit in her seven-story hotel.
(It has four rooms on each level.)
She doesn't remember yesterday's math equation volume equals height times area and she doesn't want to admit it.
So she cries at the dining room table and snaps at her mother.
``You haven't taught me,'' she accuses.
``It's not that I haven't taught you, you don't remember,'' replies Freya Fitzpatrick.
``We've talked about this before, but every so often you get confused, which is OK.
It's why we're here.''
Fitzpatrick has uncommon patience, but it breaks occasionally.
She is the only authority for her children for much of the day.
When they stop listening to her, it might be time for regular school, she said.
The girls say never.
We can have some decision in what we learn and she can focus on just us, not a whole class,'' Kaemmerle said.
``She's our mother, we have her attention.''
But their mother is clear-eyed about the whole adventure.
Someday her children might need lessons that she's unable to teach.
Someday her husband, an accountant at Office Depot, might not want to shoulder the financial burden alone.
But right now, she believes there's no better education for her girls.
``Happy?''
``Yes,'' comes the reply.
