There was no diplomatic or international school anywhere nearby, so he tried a local high school.
Liverani, an Italian who also speaks English and understands some French, had been told classes would be taught in French, but most teachers spoke Bambara, the native language.
``This was the last straw,'' he said.
``It was a mess.''
An official at the United States consulate suggested the Independent Study High School, based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
Founded in 1929 as a correspondence program to educate rural Nebraskans, the school has one of only a few fully accredited distance-education programs offering high school diplomas; other well-known programs include the North Dakota Division of Independent Study in Fargo and Texas Tech University Distance Learning in Lubbock.
They offer an option for the children of diplomats and missionaries, or those who can't or don't want to go to a schoolhouse every day.
Among young athletes and actors who have studied through Nebraska are Michelle Kwan, the Olympic silver medalist, and Lisa Bonet, a star of ``The Cosby Show.''
While most students take courses to fill gaps in their school records, some 3,400 students have received diplomas from Nebraska since 1968.
With the emergence of home schooling as a viable choice for teen-agers, enrollment has increased almost 50 percent in the last decade, according to James Schiefelbein, the Nebraska school's principal.
Today there are some 5,000 students at any given time, representing more than 130 countries.
Joining the new wave in distance education, the school has begun offering on-line courses and is developing a complete on-line, four-year curriculum with the help of a $15 million grant from the federal Department of Education.
For now, students must take a mix of Web and correspondence courses to meet diploma requirements, which are 40 courses, or 200 course hours.
Assignments are submitted by mail, fax or e-mail to 9 permanent teachers, who grade them with help from 10 to 15 part-timers.
When written examinations are required, a proctor approved by the school administers the tests.
``Our kids do very, very well post- secondary,'' Schiefelbein said.
``They are not dependent on somebody to tell them what to do and when, so they have a little bit of an advantage on their peers because they have become more self-disciplined workers.''
The school designed a program for Liverani, now 28, that allowed him to finish his diploma requirements in a year and a half.
From his remote home, he sent assignments by mail, and they were graded and returned that way.
``They managed to make you feel that you were part of a school,'' said Liverani, who worked this past summer in New York City as an intern at The Economist and is hoping for a journalism job in Europe.
They would write a lot.
That was important because it was a continuous relationship.''
Allison Rizzuto, of Omaha, an Independent Study graduate, remembers getting a big box of experiments in the mail for physical science class.
``It's kind of funny, because you are in the kitchen with a bunsen burner and you have to do all these experiments by yourself,'' she said.
Ms. Rizzuto, worried that attending a traditional school until 3 p.m. would derail her career, had convinced her parents to let her take correspondence courses so she could sing in a folk-pop group with her three older sisters.
She studied from 8 a.m. to noon for four years, spending afternoons practicing or touring the county and state fair circuit.
In May her group, Mulberry Lane, named for the street the sisters grew up on, released a debut CD, ``Don't Cry Til You Get to the Car,'' which they recorded themselves in their home studio.
``In correspondence school, every textbook you get, you have to finish the whole thing.
You read every page of the book.''
