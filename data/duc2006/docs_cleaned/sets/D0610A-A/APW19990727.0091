Republican presidential contender Gary Bauer said Tuesday that school voucher proposals should be expanded to cover the cost to parents of educating their children at home.
Bauer noted that most school voucher proposals provide funds for moving children to private schools or public schools outside the home district but don't include home schooling.
``The politicians didn't think very much about this particular alternative,'' he said.
``This is a legitimate choice and I want to make sure the playing field is level.''
The proposal came as Bauer met with a group of parents who home-school their children.
Voucher programs allow parents the freedom to take the education funding earmarked for their child and use it to pay the costs of attending a school other than their neighborhood public school.
Most of the debate is over whether tax money for public school students should be used for tuition at private schools.
Public school advocates say that undermines public education, but most conservatives favor that step.
Bauer favors voucher programs for private schools, but expanded that Tuesday to include home schooling.
He said parents could use the money for curriculum material, or to hire help in areas where they don't feel competent to teach.
Home-school advocates won a years-long legislative battle that allows them to teach their children at home.
Many are religious conservatives unhappy with the public school curriculum and the lack of religious instruction.
Bauer is appealing to these conservatives in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
He made it clear he would favor home schooling if he's elected.
He argued that there's some history of youngsters who are taught at home, and they measure up well against students taught in both private and public schools.
``If the parents are engaged, the children are in pretty good shape,'' said Bauer.
``Those of you who are engaged in home schooling are doing something incredibly important for your children.''
Under Iowa law, parents do not have to be licensed teachers to home-school youngsters.
They register youngsters with the local school district, which has staffers who will offer assistance and advice.
The youngsters are tested periodically and can take part in some extracurricular activities.
Bauer said advocates won that law by pressuring politicians, and demonstrated effectiveness.
``At the end of the day, politicians fear unemployment more than anything,'' he said.
