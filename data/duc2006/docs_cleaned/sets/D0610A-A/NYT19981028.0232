Tammy and Dan Kihlstadius, a Bloomington, Minn., couple with seven home-schooled children, established an online computer reselling business and software review publication catering to Christian home schoolers in the early 1990s (www.homecomputermarket.com).
Their reselling business now averages about 100 orders a month, with business from Appalachian hill families as well as affluent home schoolers from around the world.
Their first computer guide was published in 1993 with only four pages and was handed out free at home-schooling conventions.
Today, they charge $7 for their ``Home-schooler's Computer Guide,'' which is more than 100 pages long and contains reviews of more than 300 educational software titles.
Their annual catalog includes a section called ``100 Programs You Should Not Buy'' and notes if a title features witchcraft, magic or aliens.
Wendy and David Orth, a Cherry Valley, Mass., couple with six home-schooled children, have built the gigantic, Homeschool Publishing House(bravewc.com/hph), which produces the ``Homeschool Seller'' catalogue.
The Orths list home schoolers' used supplies in the catalog at no charge, and when a sale is made, the home schooler pays them 15 percent of the sale price.
``It pays its own bills, but my husband certainly can't quit his day job,'' Mrs. Orth said.
Most of the items listed are Christian-themed.
Major educational publishers are eyeing the scene, but so far few heavy hitters have embraced the home-schooling market.
The notable exception is Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft.
Vulcan Northwest, his 12-year-old umbrella organization for his business ventures, is backing a new online tutorial called APEX (Advance Placement Excellence).
The first course is advanced placement calculus.
This winter, the curriculum will be expanded to include microeconomics and American government.
The goal is to add five more courses next year and five more each each subsequent year.
The courses have been designed in cooperation with the College Board, which oversees advanced placement classes college-level courses offered to high-school students that can count toward college credits.
The company's is aiming to attract business from both the home-schooling and the institutional schooling markets.
For $300 per semester, a student can tap into a library of 15-minute teacher-narrated tutorials with multimedia animations of key concepts; participate in bulletin board discussion sessions, and complete both online and off-line homework.
The activities go into a database and can be reviewed, critiqued and ``debugged'' by the teacher.
The calculus course involves more than 250 learning activities.
Between 30 and 40 students are taking it this fall, but as many as 150 could participate in the microeconomics and government courses.
