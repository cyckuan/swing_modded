When other kids were reading Dr. Seuss or Winnie the Pooh, George Thampy was curled up with Noah Webster.
''He could sit with the dictionary for hours and hours, and still enjoy life,'' said his mother, Bina Thampy, laughing.
''I've never heard him in all these years say 'I'm tired,' 'I'm fed up,' 'Mommy, another day.'''
George started with the dictionary at age 6 and kept on reading it because ''I just really want to be educated.''
According to George's parents, the key to his victory wasn't the time he spent with the dictionary or the hours of preparation.
It was the hours he spent as a home-schooled student.
''We teach these children the art of studying,'' said K. George Thampy, George's father.
''If I give him a new thing today, I'm confident he'll become a master of it in a very short period of time with very little help.''
Take, for example, George's second-place performance in the National Geographic Bee a week before the spelling bee.
He began preparing just four months before the finals.
George's successes, along with those of other home-schooled students in such high-profile and high-pressure events, are bringing attention to the home-schooling movement.
The top three finishers at this year's spelling bee were home-schooled, as were four of the 10 finalists in the geography bee, the most ever.
''Events like those of the last week have really helped drive home a strong message that people need not worry about our academic quality,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va. ''We're going to do just fine.''
The National Home Education Research Institute estimates the number of home-schooled children somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7 million, a number that's growing by at least 7 percent a year.
The Thampys became part of those statistics while living in an area of Houston where public schools had installed metal detectors.
That wasn't the kind of school environment the two immigrants from India had pictured for their children.
They made the decision to home-school six of their seven children.
Mrs. Thampy does most of the teaching, working during the day on languages, economics, social sciences.
Thampy, a fellow in endocrinology at Washington University, works with his kids on math and science at night.
George's brother Eapen was a national finalist in the geography bee in 1997 and 1998, and sister Mallika finished sixth last year.
''We believe we can provide an all around education, an all around development of the child,'' Thampy said.
Farris cites a study that found home-schooled students scored higher than public and private school students on two widely used standardized tests.
''It's not just a few kids that really excel, but that the average home school kid is a top student also,'' Farris said.
There are critics.
The National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, doesn't believe home-schooling can provide students with a comprehensive education.
But NEA spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons admits there are obvious advantages to home-schooling.
''What a great class size,'' she said.
''Every teacher in America would like that.''
George's education stresses the three Rs, as well as public speaking, personal hygiene and health.
He takes field trips with other home-schooled students to museums, farms and his dad's endocrinology lab at Washington University in St. Louis.
Sometimes he learns in a group with his siblings, but often he is taught individually and frequently he does in-depth research on subjects via the Internet.
They don't think I'm strange because I'm home-schooled, especially since we study the same subjects, only in a different way,'' George wrote in a letter published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal.
His parents caution that it's not as easy as it might sound.
''The struggle is the time,'' Thampy said.
''It is extremely expensive in the aspect of time.
You never can do all the things you want for the children.
Your work gets behind.''
