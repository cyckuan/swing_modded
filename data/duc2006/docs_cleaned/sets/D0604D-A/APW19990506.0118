Now that a few people have actually seen the new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded to the buzz.
And the buzz is ... well, don't expect a masterpiece, just a really good movie with cool special effects.
In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.
Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19.
``Guys, it's a movie!''
``It isn't the Bible!
It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism.
But it's a movie.''
Uh huh.
In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans.
``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it feels like 'Star Wars.'
However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are going to walk away satisfied with?
Well ... perhaps, but not for everyone,'' Epstein wrote.
While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was annoying.
Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be ``PHENOMENAL!!!!''
``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he said.
On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow!
What a film.
I'm going to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.''
But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed.
``It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare,'' Job21 said.
That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would suggest he was there.
The film is going to play big in those first two weeks without question.''
After that ... the Force only knows.
