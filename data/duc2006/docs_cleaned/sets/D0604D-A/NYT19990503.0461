There were a lot of storm troopers wandering around without their blaster guns at the ``Star Wars'' Celebration here, the first convention and exposition dedicated to the 22-year-old movie series to win the approval and support of the films' creator, George Lucas.
Through a strange twist of fate, the ``Star Wars'' Celebration landed in Denver on the same weekend as the National Rifle Association convention, which drew 7,000 protesters, and just 10 days after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, a suburb 20 minutes away.
It was food for thought, not least because the ``Star Wars'' movies whose ``dark side'' leans heavily on the iconography of the Third Reich, an obsession of the Columbine killers are filled with the kind of shoot-'em-up entertainment fantasy that many citizens are blaming for society's ills.
Throughout the convention, which drew about 40,000 fans to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum here Friday to Sunday, the specter of Columbine hung over the event like the Death Star.
Decipher spokesman said the company declined ``because other kids would start thinking it's fun to kill him with a blaster'' during game play.
Eric Harris, one of the two students who planned and died in the Littleton attack, included a rant on his Web site about things he hated, including ``Star Wars'' fans.
At the booth run by Star Wars Insider, the official fan club magazine, which organized the convention, action figures with guns were no longer for sale.
Dan Hogatt, a 30-year-old foreman at Ford Motor Co. in Louisville, Ky., who dressed up as a very convincing Chewbacca complete with a fur head and suit, foam latex hands and drywall stilts that boosted his height to 8 feet, had to check his crossbow at the door.
(Light sabers were deemed permissible.)
``They asked us not to bring our weapons in here,'' he said.
``And I was upset, but I totally understand.''
In the search for answers to the Littleton tragedy, convention goers turned to their favorite film.
One speaker told the audience to always remember the Columbine events and a quote from Yoda that appears in a trailer for the forthcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menance.''
(The first movie in the new trilogy is set a generation before the first three ``Star Wars'' films.)
``Fear is the path of the Dark Side,'' the green Zen master says.
``Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.''
But in the end the anticipation that the first ``Star Wars'' prequel would be in theaters in less than three weeks on May 19, a date more anxiously awaited than the millennial New Year's Eve for most of these fans snapped fans out of tragic reality and into happy fantasy.
Some had overcome hardship to attend the celebration.
And Joshua Hamilton, a 26-year-old from Denver who works for a publisher of comic books, wandered through the exhibition center with his forehead lacerated with fresh cuts, a result of a car crash just hours earlier.
``Our car was totaled,'' said his wife, Kimberly.
``The ambulance came and put him in a neck brace and strapped him to a board.
They X-rayed both of us at the hospital and said we were OK.
It was worth it.
This is a once in a lifetime event.''
As films and personalities race through pop culture leaving a trail of momentary obsession behind them, ``Star Wars'' has passed the test of time and has spanned generations.
It has worked its epic tale of the relationships between good and evil, father and son, man and machine, youth and maturity, and thinking and feeling into a cultural landmark.
Joseph Campbell (whose book ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' seems to have inspired the galaxy-saving journey of Luke Skywalker) has been perhaps the films' greatest ally, examining it as a myth as universal as the Upanishads or the Bible.
``It's almost like a religion,'' said Won Park, a watercolor artist who flew in from Honolulu and dressed up as the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in ``Episode I'').
``If George Lucas turned this into a religion, it would blow L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics out of the window.''
Hubbard, of course, was a science-fiction writer before he led the Church of Scientology.
Nearby, Michael Cruz, a 24-year-old fan from New York City with seven ``Star Wars'' tattoos and a wife in her eighth month of pregnancy, said they were waiting to watch ``Episode I'' to select a name for their baby.
Some of the people feverishly wandering through the tents and airplane hangers housing ``Star Wars'' toy and video game previews, glass-encased movie props and collectible merchandise seemed to fit the stereotype of geeky males in their 20s and early 30s.
But the convention drew a racially, sexually, ethnically and generationally mixed crowd, many in costume although inexplicably there was nary a Luke Skywalker or C-3PO in sight.
It was hard to tell whether a parent or a child was the ``Star Wars'' fan, and often the answer was both.
The universe of ``Star Wars'' is one of his making, the quality of its images and products rigorously maintained and controlled by his company over the years.
The tale itself a fantasy rendered with elaborate realism down to the last planet, droid and Gungan, each of which has its own background story was created with the kind of methodical obsession with detail that is the hallmark of an Outsider artist like Henry Darger.
In his Chicago apartment several decades ago, the reclusive Darger typed 15,000 single-spaced pages and drew 300 oversize water-colors carefully detailing of the plight of young slave girls in outer space and the battle between their captors, the Glandelinians, and their protectors, the Abbennians, along with all kinds of supplemental characters and species.
The battle myth could have attracted a ``Star Wars''-like cult complete with corresponding action figures.
But without the benefit of mass entertainment it attracted only one fan in the artist's lifetime: Darger himself.
Of the more than 30,000 ``Star Wars'' products a $4 billion business with rarities that fetch as much as $25,000 in the case of one Boba Fett action figure that shoots projectiles that may land in the throats of young children every one has been approved by Lucasfilm.
At the convention, merchants like Hallmark and Hasbro lucky enough to receive a Lucasfilm license showcased their official products from blow-up pool rafts shaped like Naboo Starfighters to toothbrushes emblazoned with the likeness of the new character Jar Jar Binks as if they were fragments of the lost ark.
``Next thing you know, it will be on the Internet.''
When asked why anyone would care to post images of costumes of familiar characters on the Internet, the representative replied, ``I don't know, they told me to say that,'' ``they'' referring to Lucasfilm officials.
``It's all been hush-hush.''
Merchants were under strict orders not to sell or even discuss merchandise from the forthcoming movie, some of which conveniently went on sale in stores on Monday, the day after the convention ended.
``But now that I've seen them, I'm going to increase my order.''
As he spoke, passers-by paused to take photos of Puttkammer, who was dressed as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his 10-month-old daughter, dressed as Yoda, in her stroller.
In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film, including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
Ms. August was actually asked what it felt like to be the grandmother of Luke Skywalker.
``Star Wars'' buffs may be able to distinguish between fantasy and reality, but it was clear which side they preferred.
When an audience member asked Park whether his character, the devilish-looking, double-light-saber-wielding Darth Maul, would be returning in Episode II, the audience broke into confused murmurs.
``What do you want to hear?''
``The truth or a lie?''
Roaring through the tent came the overwhelming reply of over a thousand fans screaming in unison, ``A lie!''
