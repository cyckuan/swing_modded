failed bet on a "Star Wars" craze in Britain has left a publisher with 10 million unsold books and a vacancy for the post of chief executive.
British children's books publisher Dorling Kindersley announced Monday that its chief executive has resigned because of "a seriously misjudged" overinvestment in books tied to the launch of the latest movie in the saga, "Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace."
Expecting a Christmas rush, James Middlehurst arranged for the group to print 13 million of the books in the 18 months to Dec. 31 last year.
Sales totaled 3 million.
Company chairman Peter Kindersley blamed the "Star Wars" debacle for more than half of a pretax loss of $41 million which it expects to announce in the spring.
