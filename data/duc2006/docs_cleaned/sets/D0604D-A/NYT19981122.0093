The opening title reads: ``Every generation has a legend.
Every journey has a first step.
Every saga has a beginning.''
Then the John Williams music starts, the opening chords so unmistakable that movie audiences burst into applause.
``Star Wars'' is back.
Or more precisely, a 2-minute 10-second trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace,'' the first ``Star Wars'' film since the release of ``Return of the Jedi'' 15 years ago.
The new film, written and directed by George Lucas, opens on May 21, but the anticipation for it is extraordinary, several distribution executives say.
The trailer was screened on Tuesday in 26 states on 75 screens selected by the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox.
Fans heard about it four days earlier on the Lucasfilm Web site (www.starwars.com), and it quickly turned into a film event that had no precedent.
Theaters showing films like ``The Waterboy,'' ``The Siege'' and ``Meet Joe Black'' were crammed with people mostly young men who paid full admission just to see the trailer and left when the movie began.
The trailer was also shown after each movie ended, so a handful of theater owners allowed filmgoers to return with their torn ticket stub.
(Historically, trailers used to be shown after movies ended, hence the name.)
``This is incredible,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., which monitors the box office for theater owners.
``We've never heard of a trailer packing people into a theater.
It's a precedent-setting event.''
He said the reaction to the gimmick made it inevitable that the new ``Star Wars'' would have powerful audience appeal.
``It's going to reach fever pitch with this movie, which is unquestionably going to be one of the biggest of 1999,'' Dergarabedian said.
Tom Sherak, the chairman of Fox's Domestic Film Group, said the idea for the early-in-the-week trailer, which was released nationally over the weekend, came from Lucas' associates.
``They said since they have such a big fan base, why not set something up just for the fans first and make sure it's shown to the rest of the public very quickly?''
``The idea was to figure out a way to have fun with this.
`Star Wars' is part of the culture, but it's still a movie.
Let's treat it like a movie.''
Underscoring the box office impact of the trailer and the trailer alone were the substantial gains made on Tuesday night over Monday at theaters showing it.
At the Mann Theater in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, near the University of California, ``The Siege'' took in $13,000 on Tuesday night; it had taken in only $1,000 on Monday night.
At the Union Square Theater 14 in Manhattan, ``Meet Joe Black'' grossed $6,300 on Monday night, but $10,800 on Tuesday night.
The new ``Star Wars'' is the first of three planned prequels that will go back in time a full generation and detail the story of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the mysterious and sinister Darth Vader.
In the new film, Skywalker is a 9-year-old boy and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a brash young Jedi knight.
Lucas himself has virtually total control over the film.
Not only has he put his personal fortune into it, he is in charge of its promotion and distribution.
No decisions are made without his approval.
The trailer itself shows glimpses of some of the film's stars: Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; Natalie Portman as the young Queen and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker.
Samuel L. Jackson and Terence Stamp are also in the cast.
`Star Wars,'' the reaction to the trailer seemed to burn up the Internet.
It has been shown on the ``Star Wars'' Lucasfilm Web site, and was widely videotaped by fans when it was shown on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood.''
``The trailer felt like five seconds,'' said Harry Knowles, who founded the Ain't-It-Cool-News Web site (www.aint-it-cool-news.com), which is populated by movie fans obsessed with ``Star Wars.''
Over the Internet, Knowles seemed stricken with guilt about his early qualms about the new ``Star Wars.''
``What on earth was I ever thinking?
Analyzing every nugget, every whisper.
Worrying about reshoots and deadlines.
George seems to be 100 percent on his game.''
Other fans, on the Internet, talked about weeping and shaking while watching the trailer.
On Knowles' Web site, a fan named David Chung summed up his feelings: ``What can I say!
George Lucas must be a superior form of life!''
