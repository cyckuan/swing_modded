The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer, told The Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of ``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3.
``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.
Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming from toy sales.

``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing virtually all information on their products to the general public, including the media.
Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves.
Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin stocking store shelves late on May 2.
