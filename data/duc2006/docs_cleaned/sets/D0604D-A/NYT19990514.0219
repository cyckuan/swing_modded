In the specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking.
Its success, along with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind of movie forever.
In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that ``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind.''
It got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still imitated today, 60 years later.
If the cable outlet E!, which serves up fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd manipulations.
Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before its release as hard as that is to believe and that Lucas had to shop around to get made.
Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit ``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars.''
And one of the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was stuck inside in the Sunday Arts Leisure section, and detailed a Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into theaters on time.
Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the first post-Vietnam War-era movie.
That is, the first big movie of its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by '70s cynicism or fear of the draft.
(Lucas was set to direct what became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's not that he was unfamiliar with those elements.)
The characters more archetype than character, really lent themselves to the sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so.
Luke Skywalker's quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and Superman's feats.
It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into hyperspace.
If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it might have got the obsessives out of the house.
But bringing the trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who were kids when they saw it the first time.
And the rerelease also served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace.''
``Phantom'' is in the unique and intimidating position of being hyped everywhere for its May 19 opening.
The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before.
Before ``Star Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from their TVs.
Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before ``Star Wars'' was made.
(The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was made by 20th Century Fox ironically, the studio that became the home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it.)
Even ``Jaws'' was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation that was running the film industry.
They didn't yet realize that science fiction was due to replace the western as the action metaphor that mattered.
Unless Stanley Kubrick put them up there.
``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No.
