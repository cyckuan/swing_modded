If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc., the maker of the popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and eject pellet-size sweets.
His company, known for its dispensers of Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a galaxy far, far away.
Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.''
The new dispensers show the heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the furry-faced Ewoks.
The company already has other well-known ``Star Wars'' faces in its arsenal Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers, Yoda and Chewbacca.
More are coming.
McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars'' collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in Orange, Conn. ``It's a big thing for us.''
It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style.
In 1996, PEZ bigwigs trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German word for peppermint pfefferminz.
``They loved us, we loved them,'' McWhinnie explained.
But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year 1997 the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored and returned to the big screen.
So they were pleasantly surprised when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
Fast forward to 1999.
Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters on top of the 150 characters currently in production to the Pez family.
For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps until the ``Phantom'' appears.
