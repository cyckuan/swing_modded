The United States will continue supporting the economic and political reforms in Mongolia, a U.S. senior official said here.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Shirk, who was on a visit to Mongolia between November 12-14, made the remarks while meeting with Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan.
She said that the United States was satisfied with the development of relations and cooperation with Mongolia during the past ten years after the two countries set up diplomatic ties.
The U.S. is also willing to cooperate with Mongolia in the field of environmental protection, Susan added.
She also revealed that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would probably visit the Asian country.
Enkhsaikhan was grateful to the U.S. support for his country's reforms and considered Susan's visit as a good beginning for the U.S. delegation afterward.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. government attached great importance to the strategic status of Mongolia, which led to rapid development of the relations between the two countries.
So far, Mongolia has received more than 70 million U.S. dollars of economic and technological aid from the United States, and the two sides had signed an agreement on military exchange and cooperation.
