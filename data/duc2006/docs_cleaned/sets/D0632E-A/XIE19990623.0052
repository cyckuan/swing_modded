Some international organizations and foreign countries vowed here Tuesday to provide 320 million U.S. dollars in loans and aid to Mongolia to help it overcome economic difficulties and to assist in the transition to a market economy.
Under the promise reached in a two-day international conference on economic aid to Mongolia by some participant states and international organizations, Mongolia will receive 320 million dollars in the next 18 months.
The money will be used to stabilize its macro economy, carry out reforms on economic structuring and the monetary system, upgrade infrastructure, support the development of private ownership and solve social problems such as unemployment and poverty.
Some 20 countries, including China, the United States, Japan, and eight international organizations, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, attended the meeting, the 7th of its kind.
This meeting was co-sponsored by the World Bank and the Mongolian government.
Mongolia has secured 2 billion dollars in loans and aids from the international communities in the period from 1991 to 1998.
According to reports here, about 45 percent of Mongolia's annual investment and budget depends on foreign loans and economic aid.
