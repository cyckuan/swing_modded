Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, met here today with Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa, visiting Mongolian minister of external relations.
China and Mongolia are friendly neighbors, and bilateral relations, especially trade ties, have seen substantial progress since the normalization of relations, thanks to efforts on both sides, Shi said.
He said that the Chinese government is willing to make continuous efforts, together with its Mongolian counterpart, to promote further development of friendly, cooperative relations in the new century.
Mongolia suffered from disastrous heavy snows last winter, and the Chinese government and people have decided to send relief goods, Shi noted.
Tuyaa expressed his thanks for the Chinese aid, saying that it is a reflection of the friendship between the two peoples.
Trade relations have become increasingly more significant in bilateral relations in recent years, Shi said, predicting there is great potential for stepping up trade cooperation.
After the meeting, the two sides signed documents on China's free petroleum aid to Mongolia.
The Mongolian minister came to China yesterday for a week-long visit at the invitation of China's Foreign Ministry.
