Economic problems between Russia and Mongolia will be resolved, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov said on Tuesday.
He acknowledged that Mongolia's debts to Russia and Russia's raising of value-added-tax which has prevented Mongolian products from entering the Russian market, have caused some problems in bilateral relations.
But he assured visiting Mongolian Minister of External Relations Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren that these difficulties could be overcome.
Primakov said that in spite of these problems, Russia's relations with Mongolia are developing positively and that there are no major conflicts between the two countries.
The Russian foreign minister also welcomed the development of good relations between China and Mongolia and said he supported the maintenance of active dialogue between countries in the region.
