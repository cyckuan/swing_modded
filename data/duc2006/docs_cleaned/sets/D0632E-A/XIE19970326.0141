The first French cabinet minister visiting Mongolia has brought in a grant of 20 million French franc (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
Corinne Lepage, France's minister of environment, told a press conference today that the assistance is earmarked for hydro-power and environmental protection projects in Mongolia.
To facilitate the official aid program, Lepage said at the end of her two-day stay, she had signed a protocol with Shukhar Altangerel, Mongolia's minister of external relations.
An agreement was signed with her Mongolian counterpart Tsohio Adyasuren on cooperation in environmental protection, she said.
During her visit, Lepage met with Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, and attended the opening ceremony of a French cultural center at the Mongolian Foreign Languages Institute.
Enkhsaikhan reportedly told Lepage that while Mongolia has rich natural resources and France owns advanced technologies, the two could work together to complement each other's advantages.
He also expressed hope to further the bilateral cooperation in culture and tourism.
Although the two countries has had diplomatic ties since 1965, it was during President Ochirbat's tour of France last April that they agreed on the reopening of French embassy here and their relations took an upturn.
