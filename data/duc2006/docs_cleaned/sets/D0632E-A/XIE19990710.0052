Mongolian Prime Minister Janlaviin Narantsatsralt said here Saturday that his country will expand and further develop relations of "comprehensive partnership " with Japan oriented toward the 21st century.
Narantsatsralt made the remarks while meeting with his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi, who arrived here on Saturday noon for a two-day visit.
Mongolia needs foreign support and aid, especially those from donor nations, to help it deepen the comprehensive socio-economic reforms, Narantsatsralt said.
He also expressed his gratitude to Japan for its promise to increase loans and assistance to Mongolia.
During the talks, Obuchi said that Japan, which is the largest donor nation for Mongolia, will support the inland country's democratic and economic reform, the expansion of bilateral trade, the increase of investment in Mongolia and the development of small- and medium-size enterprises.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in the Korean Peninsula and in the Northeast Asian region.
Obuchi also held talks with Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and parliament chairman Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj.
The relations between Japan and Mongolia have developed rapidly since the early 1990s.
Japan has organized six international meetings with the World Bank to help Mongolia get 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, about one third of which was from Japan.
At the seventh international meeting for assistance to Mongolia held in June, Japan promised to provide 115 million dollars worth of loans in aid to Mongolia within the coming 18 months.
Obuchi flew in after a visit to China.
