The Mongolian Ministry of External Relations should be active in promoting economic diplomacy, its new minister R. Amarjargal said in the People's Right newspaper published on Friday.
In his first speech published after he took office late last month, Amarjargal said it is the call of the times to add economic diplomacy to the work of the ministry, for the economic relations between Mongolia and other countries bear a special significance for Mongolia's further development.
On the fundamental principle of Mongolia's foreign policy, the 37-year-old minister said his country should be active in political and economic activities in the northeast Asia and the whole Asian-Pacific region.
He also stressed the need to maintain a consistent Mongolian foreign policy by keeping its relationship with China and Russia at an appropriate level.
