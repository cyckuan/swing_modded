The United States will expand bilateral relations and multilateral cooperation with Mongolia, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here Saturday.
In a joint statement released after meeting Mongolian Prime Minister Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, Albright pledged U.S. support for Mongolia's ongoing economic and political reforms and continued U.S. aid to Mongolia.
The United States backs Mongolia's efforts to join international organizations which are influential in the world, and recognizes its status as a nuclear-free state, she said.
The U.S. secretary of state said she was pleased to see Mongolia improving and expanding relations with neighboring Russia and China, as well as other nations in the region.
On his part, Elbegdorj thanked the United States for its support and said Albright's visit will advance the Mongolian-U.S. ties.
The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic relations in January 1987.
Both sides agreed to expand relations in political, economic, scientific and cultural sectors, and explored the possibility of cooperation in environment protection.
They expressed satisfaction over their cooperation in the defense area, such as programs for non-combative trainings and disaster relief efforts.
Albright, who is here for a nine-hour stay starting Saturday morning, also met Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Tadnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of the Great Hural, or parliament.
She is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Mongolia since former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's visits in August 1990 and July 1991.
The United States supports the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to extend preferential loans to Mongolia.
