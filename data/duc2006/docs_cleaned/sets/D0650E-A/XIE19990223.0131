Observers from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the European Union (EU) have commended the peaceful manner in Nigeria's National Assembly election and described the election as a qualified success, local press reported Tuesday.
In a statement issued in capital Abuja Monday, OAU group leader Daniel Antonio said that "the polling process has so far been peaceful, open and enabled all eligible voters to exercise their franchise."
While the OAU observers note that the turn-out was low, the statement said, "we believe that Nigerians will turn out in greater numbers to select their next president."
The 52-member observer group said that it was impressed with the conduct of all the polling officials, emphasizing that the democratic process was not only important for Nigeria but for Africa as a whole.
The EU observer group issued a statement in Abuja on Monday, saying that "the elections were peacefully conducted and can be judged a qualified success," adding the problems noted did not mar the credibility of the over- all result.
The group noted that it was impressed by the dedication of many polling officials and the openness of the process.
Despite the low turnout in Saturday's National Assembly election, the statement said that these elections marked "another important step toward the establishment of democracy and the transfer of power to a civilian government".
David Carroll, Carter Center's Associate Director of Democratic Program, was quoted as saying before his departure for Nigeria Monday that the upcoming presidential contest in Nigeria could be one of the most important elections that President Jimmy Carter has observed to date.
He noted that Carter regards the Nigerian election as the most important of the year "because if the transition to civilian rule works in Nigeria, it could change the course of history in West Africa."
