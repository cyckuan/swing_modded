President Alberto Fujimori has promised to comply with recommendations of a Carter Center delegation that said Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections.
Fujimori said he would not inaugurate new public works projects prior to the April 9 vote and that district attorneys would be assigned to monitor election campaigns.
The Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter, said Friday that Fujimori's government was abusing public funds to garner votes, had blocked opposition candidates' access to the media, and had used other irregular practices to gain an unfair advantage in the April 9 vote.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin welcomed the group's recommendation and said prompt action to meet its criticisms would help broaden and deepen democracy in Peru.
The 61-year-old president, who has denied government involvement in harassment of his rivals, said a hot line would be installed for citizens to register complaints about questionable election practices.
Fujimori, who made his pledges Saturday during a trip to the nation's central highlands, said the only Carter Center recommendation that could not be followed was its request for government financing of opposition campaign ads on privately owned television and radio.
The request fell outside constitutional provisions, he said.
The government has promised to provide free broadcast spots to his competition on government-owned channel 7.
Fujimori, who was first elected in 1990 and won an easy re-election in 1995, has a wide lead in most polls.
His opponents say his unprecedented bid for a third consecutive term violates the constitution.
