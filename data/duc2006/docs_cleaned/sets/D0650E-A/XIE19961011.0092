35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country.
The mission was invited by the Supreme Electoral Council and the leaders of the main Nicaraguan political parties, to oversee the development of the election.
The former U.S. Secretary of State, James Baker, will travel with the mission which will join other international observers watching the electoral process in Nicaragua.
The mission observers belong to the "Carter Center" group, which includes former presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Osvaldo Hurtado of Ecuador.
Its headquarters is in the U.S. city of Atlanta.
The Carter Center Council has observed 14 elections in nine countries of this hemisphere, including the 1990 Nicaraguan elections that marked the first peaceful transference of power from one party to another in this country.
The council organized several missions in November 1995, and in March, June and September of 1996 to observe voters' registration processes and other electoral preparations in Nicaragua.
