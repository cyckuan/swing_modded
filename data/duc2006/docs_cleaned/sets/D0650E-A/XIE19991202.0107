Africa, where 99 percent of the river blindness cases occur, will receive greater portion of a total sum of 16 million U.S. dollars to be provided by the Carter Center, the center said in a press release available here Thursday.
It said that the fund will be used in the prevention of blindness in Africa, Latin America and Middle East.
Through the Global 2000 River Blindness Program in collaboration with the National and District Health Services, the center has been involved in the control of river blindness in Uganda since 1996.
River blindness is controlled through community directed treatment in endemic communities.
Cases of river blindness in Uganda have mostly been discovered in the northern part of the country.
The funds received will make it possible for the Carter Center to strengthen existing programs and develop others.
The Carter Center, founded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has been fighting blindness since 1987.
This humanitarian effort is bringing relief to the affected individuals and their communities and freeing them to undertake socially and economically beneficial ventures.
