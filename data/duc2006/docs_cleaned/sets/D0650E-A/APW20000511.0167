The Atlanta-based Carter Center will send 24 elections observers to the Dominican Republic to monitor May 16 elections, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
Spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the delegation would not include former President Jimmy Carter, despite reports in local newspapers that Carter and four other former heads of state would be observers.
Hoping for a repeat of the 1996 elections, which were praised as the Caribbean country's fairest vote ever, Dominican officials have invited monitors from around the world to help observe polling.
The Central Elections Board said Wednesday it had accredited a host of former heads of state to serve as elections observers, including Carter, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, ex-President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela and former President Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador.
So far only former Colombian President Belisario Betancur has said he would attend, the board said.
The Colombian Embassy said Thursday it had received no word of a visit by Betancur.
