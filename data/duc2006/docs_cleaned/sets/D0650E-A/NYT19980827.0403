The Coca-Cola Co. Thursday gave $1.5 million to the Carter Center and Emory University to help build stronger relations with Latin America.
The Carter Center envisions using its share of the five-year donation to initiate a project called ``Transparency for Growth in the Americas.''
After years of promoting democracy in Latin American countries, the Carter Center now is turning its attention to combating corruption by urging ``transparency,'' or openness, in government.
Jennifer McCoy, director of the Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program, said the objective of the initiative is to ensure that public transactions are fair and accountable.
The hope is that the Carter Center will be able to work with Latin leaders and the international community to curtail bribery.
The Carter Center plans to work with its Council of Freely Elected Heads of Governments, a group of 31 current and former Latin leaders working on democratic reform and economic development in the Americas.
``We are grateful to the Coca-Cola Co. for helping make this happen,'' McCoy said.
Coca-Cola, which has strong economic and political ties throughout Latin America, expressed no reservations about the new focus of the Carter Center.
``That's good for all of us,'' said Timothy J. Haas, president of Coca-Cola's Latin America Group, adding that businesses like Coca-Cola flourish ``in free-market environments.''
Haas said that the Coca-Cola Co. does not have any control over Carter Center projects, but he is not concerned about any backlash that could affect his company from the Carter Center's efforts.
``We certainly can stand the scrutiny of any spotlight,'' Haas said.
As a way to get its message out, the Carter Center plans to hold a series of high-level conferences over the next five years where it will invite leaders from throughout the Americas.
The first summit will be May 4-5, 1999, in conjunction with the annual CNN World Report conference.
The center also will work with Latin American governments to encourage transparency in their transactions.
Already, McCoy said they have begun discussions with leaders in Costa Rica, Jamaica and Equador.
Emory University will use its share of the Coca-Cola donation to provide 15 scholarships for Latin American students.
The fellowships will provide an annual stipend for six students entering the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and will cover part of the tuition costs for nine students entering the Goizueta Business School's MBA program.
Emory President William M. Chace said the Coca-Cola gift will help to further internationalize the campus providing a benefit to both its current students and the Latin American scholars.
The hope is that the Latin scholars will return to their home countries and contribute to the region's development.
The idea for the Coca-Cola/Carter Center/Emory partnership originated two years ago in conversations between Pedro Pablo Diaz, Coca-Cola's vice president of communications for Latin America, and Bob Pastor, who until recently headed the Carter Center's Latin programs.
The concept was endorsed by the late Coca-Cola CEO Roberto C. Goizueta, who was born in Cuba and was a strong proponent of closer ties between Atlanta and Latin America, and M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's current CEO.
McCoy said the partnership is part of a ``growing momentum for Atlanta to be the new gateway toward Latin America.''
