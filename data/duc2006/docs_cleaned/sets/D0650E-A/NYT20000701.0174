Former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday that opposition parties are upset about alleged government attempts to coerce or buy votes for Mexico's ruling party in Sunday's historic presidential election.
But Carter said at a news conference that two top opposition candidates had told him they would accept the results of the election which could be very close if the balloting is deemed free and fair.
``The two opposition parties have expressed to us their deep concerns about some of the events that they say have occurred in the pre-election process with what they say is improper use of government resources and influence,'' said Carter, who is in Mexico to observe the elections with the Atlanta-based Carter Center.
``Since the government is headed by a major party that has been in power now for more than 70 years,'' Carter said, ``this is grounds, I think, for concern and for careful observation.''
After his arrival here Friday, Carter met with opposition candidate Vicente Fox of the Alliance for Change, who opinion polls show stands a chance of defeating, for the first time in 71 years, Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Carter also met with opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, running third in the polls, and with PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, who raised concerns that his opponents might not accept defeat.
Carter said that depends on the quality of the balloting.
``If the voting process and the counting of the ballots and the reporting of the results are deemed to be transparent and without flaws of any significant degree,'' Carter said, ``they indeed will accept the results of the election even though they retain the right to criticize some previous activities during the campaign.''
Carter praised Mexico's ``superb'' new balloting system and said that attempts at fraud on election day would probably be ``minimal and reportable, if it does occur.''
Nevertheless, allegations have been mounting that PRI government officials are doling out social aid in exchange for votes or telling social-aid recipients to vote for the PRI or lose their benefits.
``Our position is, if there is evidence of wrongdoing it should be punished,'' said Labastida spokesman Javier Trevino in response to the allegations.
On Saturday, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma published a transcript of what it said was a taped telephone conversation of the governor of Michoacan state mentioning hiding state funds and funneling money to PRI candidates in local elections.
``This is defamation,'' said Victor Tinoco, the governor, in response to the report, challenging Reforma to prove the tape was real.
Last month, an executive at the government-owned Mexican Oil Company said a pressure campaign existed inside the company to recruit PRI votes.
Carter met with the executive and his wife, who is also an employee.
But the opposition is complaining there is little time before the election to resolve cases and punish perpetrators.
