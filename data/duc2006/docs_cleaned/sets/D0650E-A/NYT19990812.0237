Not to minimize the accomplishments of the other eight Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients honored this week, but it was fitting that President Clinton just happened to make a separate presentation in Atlanta to Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.
Why?
Because the man and the woman from Plains deserve to be singled out.
Call it a happy coincidence.
Clinton was scheduled to be here Monday anyway to address the American Bar Association convention.
So it worked out nicely to confer the medals on the former president and his first lady at the Carter Center.
It has become something of a cliche to refer to Carter as the greatest ex-president in the nation's history, a tribute to countless good works he has done since he was defeated for re-election nearly two decades ago.
But Clinton, in his remarks, noted thoughtfully that the ``greatest ex-president'' label does Carter an injustice because everything he has done since leaving the White House is an extension of priorities that characterized his presidency.
Did we say countless good works?
In his medal citation, Clinton attached some impressive numbers to Carter's record of service to humanity: The 115 countries Carter has visited either on missions to promote peace and human rights or to combat disease and hunger.
The more than 20 foreign elections he has monitored to nurture nascent democracies.
The millions of Africans spared the scourges of river blindness and Guinea worm disease thanks to the work of his center.
The dozens of political prisoners released because of his personal intervention.
The list goes on and on.
Mrs. Carter, too, has earned the admiration of the nation for carrying through on causes that were dear to her even before her years in the White House and the Georgia Governor's Mansion, especially her work to improve treatment of mental illnesses and to make child immunizations widely available.
Carter acknowledged Monday that he and Rosalynn left the White House somewhat deflated after his election defeat in 1980, but they managed to build new lives full of pleasure, adventure and challenge.
That should be an instructive example for a youngish ex-president-to-be who is concerned about his own place in history.
