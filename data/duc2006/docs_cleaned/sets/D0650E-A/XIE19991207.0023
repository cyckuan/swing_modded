Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who is leading 50 observers in Mozambique, said here Monday that the Mozambican electoral process has been "overwhelmingly free and fair".
The Carter Center set up by Carter had an observation mission during the second multi-party general elections in the southern African country at the weekend.
The observers from 16 different countries visited about 650 polling stations in all 11 of the country's provincial constituencies.
Whereas the 1994 elections had been largely organized by the United Nations, "this time it's a successful product of the people of this country, " Carter said.
He regarded as "highly successful" the conduct both of the voter registration in the July-September period and now the elections themselves.
Carter said that Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the main opposition Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), did not repeat his Sunday's allegation that "electoral fraud" is being prepared.
The correct behavior of an opposition party that suspected fraud would be "to file an official complaint with the evidence," Carter said.
He said that the observers have so far not come across any evidence of fraud.
Counting took place at the polling stations on Sunday night.
Provincial results should be announced by December 12, and a week later the National Elections Commission must announce the final results.
Carter said that some of the observers would stay on to watch the provincial count and the final tabulation of the results.
The Carter Center estimated voter turnout at over 70 percent, with rates of 80 percent in some polling stations.
Carter also said the observers were impressed by "the large number of women polling staff, and of women voters", noting that "quite often the polling station chairperson was a woman."
