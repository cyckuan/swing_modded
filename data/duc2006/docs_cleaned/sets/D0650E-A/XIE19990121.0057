Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter started his three-day visit to Nigeria Wednesday with a meeting here with leading political figures in the West African country.
Among those he met is General Olusegun Obasanjo, former military leader (1976-1979) and presidential aspirant of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) .
He also met with Bola Ige, a presidential aspirant of the Alliance for Democracy, as well as leaders of political parties and other politicians.
Although Carter declined to speak with reporters on his meetings, his aide, Robert Lagamma said,"they discussed the electoral process, what the parties stand for and other transition matters."
Carter arrived in Lagos Tuesday evening at the invitation of military leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar to access the transition to civil rule program.
He is expected to meet with Abubakar, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and more politicians before winding up his visit Friday.
Observers from the Atlanta-based Carter Center have monitored local government as well as state governors and legislators elections held earlier under the transition program and are expected to monitor the coming national House of Assembly and presidential elections scheduled for February.
