The events that allowed a former coup plotter to become front-runner in Sunday's presidential vote indicate that Venezuelans are fed up with the status quo, said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
He is heading a 40-person team of international election monitors that includes former presidents Patricio Aylwin of Chile and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia and Nicholas Brady, an ex-U.S. treasury secretary.
Also expected is a separate observer delegation headed by former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, now secretary general of the Organization of American States.
``Correctly or incorrectly, the people of Venezuela seem to have lost confidence in the domination of the two major political parties in the country,'' Carter said in explaining the meteoric rise of Hugo Chavez, who as an army lieutenant colonel led an ill-fated 1992 coup attempt.
Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections a major setback for the country's two traditional political parties.
Carter did not specifically mention Chavez, or his main challenger, Henrique Salas Romer, referring to them only as ``independent candidates.''
But he said the rise of the independents and the uncertainty surrounding the election were the reasons he and his team from the Atlanta-based Carter Center were invited to observe Sunday's balloting.
Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have observed in 10 Latin American nations.
