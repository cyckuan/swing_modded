Jimmy Carter remembers fighting fraud back in Georgia in the 1960s, when one rival in a state election controlled all the welfare checks in town and pulled ballots out of boxes at his pleasure.
It was with this background that Carter came to Mexico to watch this country's historic presidential election Sunday.
``Welcome to Mexico,'' said surprised voters who recognized the former U.S. president as he strode into the Museum of the School of Medicine, a handsome stone colonial building in downtown Mexico City.
``This was where the Spanish inquisition took place,'' Carter said, gazing around the inner patio where a polling station was set up.
On this day, Carter was witnessing a more progressive step in Mexico's history.
He and others from the Atlanta-based Carter Center observed what is supposed to the cleanest and most competitive presidential election ever in Mexico.
The former president was invited by all of Mexico's major political parties.
He praised the technical aspects of Mexico's new balloting system and officials he met at the Federal Elections Institute, an independent agency supervising the elections.
Many here believe this could be an election too close to call.
Preliminary returns that could give even a hint of the winner are not expected before early Monday.
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has controlled this country's presidency for 71 years, is facing a tough challenge from center-right candidate Vicente Fox.
And the PRI, as a Carter report on the elections noted, has been criticized by opponents for coercing poor people and government workers to vote for it.
``But I know incumbency can cut both ways.''
Carter, assessing the fairness of the vote, said that if voters truly believe they can vote in secret, they turn to their conscience.
At the Museum of the School of Medicine, he noted the curtained white booths where voters marked ballots only after checking in with officials who compared their photo ID cards against registration lists with copies of photos and names.
Signs on the booths read, ``Your vote is free and secret.''
``No matter how many favors they've been promised or how many threats they've received, we hope the voters should know their vote is secret,'' Carter said.
Holding up thumbs smudged with indelible ink, voter Jose Luis Jimenez rushed up to greet Carter.
``It's an honor to have him here,'' the high school teacher said.
He said he voted for the PRI's Francisco Labastida because its candidate has experience.
After Carter left, voter Antonio Arreguin, 49, said, ``The former president?
He said he voted for Fox ``because Mexico really needs a change.''
