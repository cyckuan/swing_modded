Sitting at their students' desks two days before the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education, earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's recommended science curriculum and its standardized tests.
The teachers' reaction was as swift as it was unanimous: They would continue to teach science as they have been, with the support of their superintendent.
``They'll get evolution here,'' said Elaine Pardee, who teaches at Washburn Rural High, where the science classroom walls are lined with various animal skeletons that, by their very appearance, testify to the evolutionary theory of a common ancestor among mammals.
``We're not going to cheat our kids.''
About 200 miles away in Pratt, a small town west of Wichita, the local school board president, Willa Beth Mills, had a very different reaction to the state board's action.
She applauded it, and said she hoped that it would lead to elements of creationism or at least a heavy dose of skepticism about the theory of evolution being injected into her district's schools.
``If you present the material to students with critical thinking, and they come to you with a paper supporting creationism, or arguing against evolutionary theory from a creationist point of view, you should accept that.''
These are emotionally volatile and exceptionally confusing days for the teachers, principals and parents of Kansas' public school children.
Two weeks after the board's vote, which was widely interpreted as establishing an important national beachhead for creationists, the theater of battle has shifted to the state's 304 public school districts.
Because the adoption of standards in science or any other subject cannot be dictated under state law, it will be up to each district to decide whether to follow the lead of the state board, which periodically issues guidelines suggesting what should be taught in the state's classrooms.
What the state board can control is the content of its standardized tests.
Beginning in the 2000-2001 school year, the state tests in 7th- and 10th-grade science will not ask students questions about the theories that multiple species have evolved from a common ancestor and that the universe originated in an explosion, or big bang two ideas that have come under sharp attack from those who have found more persuasive evidence of the world's origins in religion.
Questions about ``micro-evolution,'' defined in the state guidelines as changes in an organism's ``structure, function or behavior,'' will remain.
At issue for Kansans is nothing less than reconciling two central explanations of life: the Darwinian theory that man and monkey gradually branched off from the same family tree millions of years ago as they adjusted to a changing environment, a contention heavily rooted in scientific evidence, and the creationist belief that a divine being has been pulling the biological levers of the universe, including the origin of man as described in the Bible.
The debate concerns more than what public school students should learn about each point of view, more than a decade after the Supreme Court said states could not compel the teaching of creationism.
For science teachers, the state board's characterization of evolution as a theory shrouded in doubt no matter the supporting testimony of fossils and genetic codes has raised worries about whether other theories at the heart of science, like those concerning atoms or even gravity, will come under attack next.
``All of science is theory.''
