Atomic creationists, you might say.
And their official harboring at Baylor University has caused many in the faculty to go nuclear.
The launching of a center to promote ``theistic science'' or ``intelligent design'' is proving to be one of the biggest controversies of the Robert Sloan presidency.
If not the biggest controversy, possibly it is the most emblematic.
The issue is the Michael Polanyi Center.
Created supposedly to build a bridge between science and religion, it shares a hangar with Baylor's Institute for Faith and Learning.
Problem: Baylor didn't consult anyone in its science departments.
To much of the faculty, this is no bridge.
It's a detour.
The chairman of the faculty senate, Robert Baird, calls Polanyi ``one of the most divisive issues'' in his 32 years at Baylor and bemoans that a center focused on what it calls the ``growing dialogue between science and religion'' was created without a word sought from Baylor's scientists.
While much of the concern is over process, such as the science faculty's perceived snubbing, the overriding issue is substance what Polanyi is about.
What it's about is not an alliance with science but the refuting of it, or at least refuting the science of evolution and its Darwinist underpinnings.
That was clear within the first few words of a conference called ``The Nature of Nature'' hosted by Baylor and the center last week.
University of Texas philosophy Professor Robert Koons told the audience that with the whole of evidence examined, scientists ``have no authority to dictate to us.''
Dialogue, anyone?
``Nature is comprehensible only'' if an outside force God has set in motion all the inner complexity, he said.
Koons among others, including Polanyi director William Dembski, adheres to the ``intelligent design'' theory the new creationism.
Essentially it grants to science certain facts: that the world is billions of years old rather than a few thousand, that evolution is a fact as it pertains to plants and animals, right up to the doorstep of man.
However, the essence of intelligent design is that man is in God's image, as the Bible says.
As Christians, Baylor science faculty members who so vehemently denounce Polanyi may not disagree with that bottom line.
They just see the ``intelligent design'' crowd as seeking to put a tourniquet on inquiry.
Baylor associate psychology Professor Charles Weaver derides it as the ``God card'' characterized by the bumper sticker meant to annoy any scientist: ``God says it; I believe it; that settles it.''
Whatever God might say, science is the process of studying that which can be examined and tested empirically.
In a feisty and somewhat quixotic way, the intelligent design crowd is like a kickboxer challenging a microscope to a fight.
The microscope is not there to fight.
It is there to examine.
That doesn't mean that the scientists won't fight.
Baylor associate biology Professor Richard Duhrkopf, a bitter critic of Polanyi, said the center's quest is to ``change the philosophy of science.''
More ominously, it is advocated by creationists as a wedge to get religion into science class in public schools, as reported recently by ``CNN Newsstand.''
``Darwin is dead, Darwinism is getting sicker by the day,'' wrote creationist Hal Ostrander in a recent commentary in SBC Life extolling the work of Dembski and Co. Ostrander gushes about the potential of intelligent design to transform science class in public schools.
Critics in the Baylor faculty see the Polanyi Center as undermining the university's reputation in the sciences.
If Baylor thinks Polanyi is worth risking its reputation, maybe that empirical stuff isn't what it wants to be known for.
