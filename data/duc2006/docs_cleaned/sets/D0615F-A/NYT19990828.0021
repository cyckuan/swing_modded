More than two weeks have passed since the Aug. 11 decision, and the sky is still where it's supposed to be, but there has been fallout on many fronts: The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri sent a letter to the superintendents of each of the state's 304 school districts.
It reviewed recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that outlawed teaching biblical creationism in science classes.
State Rep. David Adkins of Leawood said he would sponsor legislation requiring high school students entering state universities to have studied evolution, the theory that living things have common ancestors and change over time.
Two national science organizations the National Academy of Sciences and the American Chemical Society condemned the board's action as a setback for science education in Kansas.
Evolution proponents formed a group, Kansas Citizens for Science, to support teachers and districts that want to teach the theory.
The publisher of a new textbook on Kansas history has decided to drop a chapter on the state's prehistory.
The chapter focused on the prehistoric inland sea and 150 million-year-old fossils found in western Kansas.
After hearing national reports about the new science standards, the board of the foundation publishing the book thought some Kansans might take issue with those topics.
``If we talk about (things that old), then it's beyond a creation date that most religions use,'' said Jim Bean, director of the Grace Dangberg Foundation in Carson City, Nev., which promotes the study of history by young people.
Kansas State University Professor Gary Conrad said he's having difficulty recruiting candidates for two openings within the biology department.
Last week, Conrad said, the president of an out-of-state research institution told him she would discourage her students from considering Kansas for employment because their children would be subjected to a public school education that might not include evolution.
School board members in Pratt, Kan., west of Wichita, listened to a presentation on a science textbook that espouses the theory of intelligent design the idea that a superior being designed the universe and everything in it.
During the media frenzy after the vote of the 10-member board, confusion abounded about the science standards' purpose.
The standards are guidelines for school districts to use as they determine what students should learn.
The document written by a 27-member committee of science educators listed evolution as a major concept, but earlier this month six board members five conservatives and one moderate voted to remove the emphasis.
The tests used as part of the state's accreditation program are based on the standards, and observers say most districts teach to the test.
New science tests to be given in the 2000-2001 school year will not include questions on macro-evolution, the idea that different species can share common ancestors.
That's fine with Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita, one of the board members who favored de-emphasizing evolution.
The board's intent was not to force creationism or any other theory on the origins of life into science classrooms, but to allow school districts to decide for themselves, Brown said.
She said she checked with officials of the Wichita School District before the vote and was told students would continue to learn about evolution.
That's the district's prerogative, Brown said.
``People don't seem to want to trust their local people to make this decision, and that's all we've done,'' Brown said.
``If Yoder (Kan.) wants creationism and their people want it, that's their business.
And I'm not going to stand in the way of it.''
Brown dismisses the idea that the board's decision could harm Kansas students.
But it's a real worry for Bill Wagnon, a board member from Topeka who supported the standards written by the science teachers.
Wagnon said he feared Kansas would lose its position as a leader and innovator in education.
The K-State professor's troubles attracting faculty members are just a start, Wagnon said.
``Reputations are hard to earn and easy to shatter,'' Wagnon said.
The science standards have yet to reach school districts.
The board's attorney still is ironing out copyright questions over parts of the standards based on materials from the National Academy of Sciences.
The standards written by the teachers committee relied heavily on the academy's National Science Education Standards, but the changed version might not meet with the academy's approval.
The standards will be sent to school districts as soon as those questions are answered, said Kathy Toelkes, the board's spokeswoman.
Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, said his organization had recruited a Kansas City law firm to determine what legal recourse the ACLU has.
He disputed Brown's claim of a return to local control.
``Why have standards at all?''
Kurtenbach said.
``Why select one aspect of it but pass on pages and pages and pages of other mandated issues?
If it was about local control, the state board would eliminate all standards and go out of business.''
