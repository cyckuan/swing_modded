Frisby, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School, starts each school year by explaining to parents what their children will learn: the habits, physical characteristics and life processes of plants and animals, and evolution, to explain how those processes developed.
``Without evolution, the building will fall down,'' Frisby said.
``It's the cornerstone of biology.''
Frisby is adamant that the Christian belief in a universe created by God has no place in his science classroom.
But one of Frisby's brightest students, 14-year-old Heather Ellsworth, sees evolutionary theory as so much hogwash.
She believes God alone created the earth and everything on it, just as the Bible says.
Some teachers take a low-key approach to teaching evolution, the scientific theory that living things share common ancestors but change over time.
Others, such as Frisby, emphasize it.
At the forefront of this discussion are Kansas' new science curriculum standards.
The version written by a state committee would declare evolution one of five concepts that unite all scientific disciplines.
The 10-member Kansas Board of Education, split evenly down conservative-moderate lines, is struggling to find consensus between the two ideas.
The courts and many in the science community, including Frisby, say those ideas are mutually exclusive inside science classrooms.
On Heather's first day in freshman biology, Frisby told his class that evolution holds the underpinnings for the life sciences.
After class, Heather approached him.
``He said, `Let's agree to disagree.'
And they've been disagreeing agreeably all year long.
Frisby hasn't changed his lessons to accommodate Heather's beliefs, although last fall he did attend a creation science workshop at the invitation of Heather's father.
Heather hasn't changed her mind, either, but she answers test questions on evolution by the book.
``We can live with that,'' said the Rev.
Phil Ellsworth, Heather's father and pastor of the evangelical Grace Christian Fellowship Church in Shawnee.
Could this truce be the kind of middle ground that Kansas Board of Education members are looking for?
Larry Scharmann thinks it might be.
As an education professor at Kansas State University, Scharmann tells future teachers they should not present theories such as evolution in ways that polarize their students.
Teachers needs to realize that students, like everyone else, value the beliefs they've learned from their families and churches.
``You're not trying to beat that out of them,'' Scharmann said.
Understanding doesn't mandate belief, Scharmann said.
Science teachers taking a realistic view of their students know this, he said.
``(Students) don't have to believe these theories, just know how to use them,'' Scharmann said.
``Evolution, like all good scientific theories, is an excellent problem-solving tool.''
The science standards that have revived the debate determine what Kansas students will learn and be tested on.
The standards, written by a state committee appointed in part by the state board, are based on guidelines from national science associations.
Evolution takes a leading role, and that's what led to the alternate proposal put forth by conservative board member Steve Abrams of Arkansas City.
Abrams' version would change the definition of science, eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add to the glossary a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.''
Abrams has said the intent of his proposal is partly to allow school districts the freedom to decide how to handle teaching evolution.
That's similar to the way the Missouri curriculum standards work, said Orlo Shroyer, Missouri's assistant commissioner of education.
The controversy over evolution is nothing new for members of the Shawnee Mission Northwest science department.
Several years ago, the school's science test scores dipped because teachers were avoiding evolutionary theory, said Robert Siemens, the department chairman.
So the department beefed up its approach to evolution, Siemens said.
Last year, a few students and parents objected to a mural in the science hall depicting the evolution of humans from an apelike creature to modern man.
The mural remains, but the teachers wonder for how long.
And this year, the science standards are causing much discussion, at least among the science faculty.
The teachers know that some students don't believe evolution occurred.
Although most of Siemens' students realize the theory has a place in science classrooms, there always are a few who ask to be excused from learning about evolution, saying it goes against their religious belief in creation.
``And that's so sad.''
Siemens and Frisby always end their units on evolution by assigning students a paper on the origin of life.
The assignment gives students the chance to defend their beliefs, and some always choose to write on creation.
Frisby said that this year he has more students about 40 percent who don't accept evolution.
One parent has offered nm bate Frisby on the subject.
Heather Ellsworth said she understands that Frisby has to teac(AIY 1ution as the theory accepted by the majority of scientists.
Her father, Phil Ellsworth, said he's confident his daughter won't be swayed from her basic religious belief that God created the world.
Both Ellsworths believe there's room in the science classroom for more than one theory on the origin of life.
But Frisby adamantly disagrees.
``If there's no evolution, I can't teach.
