Think of it as an educational tug of war.
On the one side, the establishment that has run the nation's public school systems for years.
On the other, social conservatives who say liberalized public education is destroying the country's moral fabric.
In the middle, millions of children.
It is a national phenomenon, but nowhere are the two sides pulling harder than in Kansas.
The state's 10-member elected Board of Education is split evenly along ideological lines.
Five members are moderate Republicans or Democrats, and five, all Republicans, are Christian conservatives.
The struggle is likely to intensify this week, as the board takes up new science standards and an old question: How did life and the universe begin?
Evolution would be taught as a cornerstone of science in revised standards the board will consider Wednesday.
The standards spell out what children would learn and be tested on, and they do not mention creationism.
It also describes creation as being the result of ``intelligent design.''
Although they lack a majority, the conservatives have had an effect since they first gained control of half the seats in 1996.
Through a series of 5-5 votes and the compromises that followed, the conservatives have forced new curriculum standards and testing methods, and they have stalled implementation of some federal programs.
Bill Meek, a moderate Republican who lost a bid for the state board in 1996, says the frequent gridlock has hurt Kansas.
``If we stand still, people really do pass us by,'' said Meek, a member of the Spring Hill, Kan., Board of Education.
You either go forward, or you regress.''
He pointed to the board's 5-5 deadlock last year on accepting federal money through the Workforce Investment Act, which provides aid to states that develop career programs.
Meek says such programs help students make choices about the future.
Christian conservatives object to such programs because, they say, they steer students toward jobs that businesses say are in demand instead of leaving those decisions to the students and their families.
Last summer state board members deadlocked on a plan that was intended to give students more advanced, real-world math skills.
Conservatives objected because the plan would have allowed the use of calculators considered a crutch instead of requiring math by hand only.
The moderates compromised.
The standards, approved in March almost a year after first reaching the board, now focus on basic mathematics and prohibit elementary students from using calculators on state tests.
Kevin Gilmore, a conservative from Olathe, Kan., who was chairman of the Kansas state board for two years, views the deadlocks as the democratic process at work.
If the conservatives don't always get their way, he said, that is the democratic process, as well.
His colleagues are not the strident radicals they are sometimes painted to be by political foes, Gilmore said.
Kansas is not the only place where Christian conservatives are making their voices heard: - In Texas conservative members of the state school board pushed through a biology textbook with few references to evolution.
In Alabama a conservative group persuaded state legislators to have a disclaimer about evolution pasted inside every biology text, a move that the National Center for Science Education said intimidated teachers from introducing the subject.
Other national groups support creationism and ``creation science,'' the theory that the Earth is just a few thousand years old and that the dinosaurs died out in the Great Flood, recorded in Genesis.
Courts repeatedly have struck down efforts to teach such theories in science classes.
Like their Kansas counterparts, Christian conservatives in Ohio and Michigan have opposed the federal Workforce Investment Act and its School-to-Work program.
``Parental rights'' initiatives have cropped up in recent years in Congress and in more than 20 states, including Kansas, Indiana, Michigan and Colorado.
Conservatives say the bills would guarantee parents' rights to raise their children.
Liberals and moderates say the bills would make it easier for parents to challenge school teachings on religious grounds.
About half of the members of the Texas school board are Christian conservatives.
Additional states in which Christian conservatives have significant representation on local and state boards include California, Ohio and Virginia.
In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the governor.
Wide-ranging power The Kansas Board of Education dictates much of what is taught in the state's public schools.
The board has sweeping authority over the state's 304 public school districts, as well as its vocational schools, community colleges and schools for the deaf and the blind, but not the state universities.
It can require any program it wishes without seeking the approval of the governor or the Legislature.
The deadlocked votes have upset some state lawmakers.
Feeling pressure, board members have split the board's two-year chairmanship, which controls the board agenda.
Linda Holloway, a conservative from Shawnee, Kan., is chairwoman this year; Harold Roth, a moderate from Haven, Kan., will be chairman in 2000.
The board hoped to send voters a message that it would try to avoid deadlock.
Indeed, in March, the board unanimously approved the compromise math standards.
But a state audit of the board's performance in the last two years said the deadlocks had frustrated teachers and school administrators across Kansas.
``The tie votes are seen by some as a lack of decision-making,'' said the report, released in March.
Some lawmakers have worried that conservative members would try to reverse reform efforts such as Quality Performance Accreditation, the state's moderate-supported school improvement program.
Under the program, schools are accredited based on how well students learn specific subjects rather than on standards such as the numbers of books the schools have.
The accreditation effort developed alongside the state's new school-finance formula, and both took effect in the early 1990s.
The Legislature saw the new accreditation system as a way to link accountability and school funding.
Quality Performance Accreditation has remained intact, but conservatives have slowed the programs that the previous board was enacting.
The accreditation testing program, for example, almost died after conservatives voted not to renew it in 1997.
Finding a voice Christian conservatives think public schools have turned away from the country's educational foundation: Schools run by churches that taught right and wrong from one basic text, the Bible.
Blumenfeld said public schools ``undermine Christians' ability to influence their children.''
Christian conservatives want to return to a time when public schools worked, he said.
America's founders, he said, were Calvinists who believed that man is, by nature, a depraved creature who needs fear of a higher power to do the right thing.
Public schools at one time were based on this philosophy, Blumenfeld said, but in recent decades the schools have been shaped by secular humanism, which holds that humans control their destinies.
Christian conservatives, he said, ``have no influence over what the public schools do.
Whatever policies they have are made by liberals.''
Christian conservatives say ``A Nation at Risk'' gave voice to their fears.
The report, released in the early 1980s by a presidential panel, sharply criticized American education.
That criticism was taken by Christian conservatives as an explanation of why society's bedrock the family was crumbling.
In a sense it validated social conservatives' opinions about higher rates of divorce, teen-age pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease.
America's children spend much of their time in school.
What were they learning there?
In recent years, several Christian conservative leaders, including ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, have publicly stated their disdain for the nation's public education system.
In a speech at last fall's Christian Coalition national convention, Robertson said that 19th-century reformer John Dewey trained teachers to spread the ``poison'' of secular humanism into public schools.
Falwell has said public schools are a place of darkness.
Conservatives have decried tests that they say often contain open-ended questions to which students choose the best answer, not the right answer.
That's a form of moral relativism, in which there are no rights or wrongs, Christian conservatives say.
Comprehensive sex education in schools often presents abstinence as a choice, along with the use of contraception.
The context of marriage is not necessarily part of the lesson.
That undermines the Christian belief that sex outside marriage is wrong, conservatives said.
And in outcomes-based education, which grew out of the reforms of the 1980s, conservatives saw a trend toward focusing on children's social well-being and teaching political correctness at the cost of rigorous academics.
Education is a top priority of many national conservative organizations, such as Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and James Dobson's Focus on the Family.
These groups often have state chapters that can mobilize members for intense grass-roots campaigning, said Martha McCarthy, an Indiana University education professor who has studied the religious right.
Political action The conservatives' power stems from that political support, said Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
The group publishes a monthly newsletter that details the activities of the Christian right.
In recent years conservative leaders have mobilized their followers to vote for school board members and legislators who share their beliefs, and low voter turnout in many elections has ensured their success, Boston said.
Along with their claims that public schools are destroying America, many conservatives advocate publicly financed charter schools, homeschooling and aid, such as vouchers or tax credits, for parents who send their children to private schools.
``If they don't want to abolish the public schools, then they want to Christianize them,'' Boston said.
Similarities between conservatives' efforts across the country have caused groups such as the liberal People for the American Way and the Mainstream Coalition in Johnson County, Kan., to suggest that there is a concerted effort to discredit public schools.
Caroline McKnight, executive director of the Mainstream Coalition, a nonpartisan group that has been critical of the conservative movement, points to conservative literature criticizing school reform efforts by a handful of states.
Many of the publications use the same catch phrases, such as ``fuzzy standards'' and ``secular humanism.''
When the Christian conservatives won five of the 10 seats on the Kansas state board, some moderate and liberal groups warned that the conservative agendas showing up in other states would show up in Kansas.
The conservative board members ``have been elected to a position that's supposed to look out for the best interest of public schools,'' McKnight said.
``But the argument can be made that they don't like public education.''
Gilmore, the former board chairman, said he did not run for office out of any dislike for schools, but because for many years social conservatives had no voice in public education.
Holding office, he said, is the American way to ``have a voice in government to push conservative views.''
New standards The flap over evolution is heightening public interest in the new Kansas science standards, which the board will take up Wednesday.
The standards, which were written by a committee appointed by education Commissioner Andy Tompkins, list evolution as one of five unifying concepts that cut across the scientific disciplines.
Since January, when the standards first appeared before the board, Christian conservatives have urged board members to reject the document because evolution goes against their beliefs.
They want equal time for the belief that God alone created Earth and its creatures.
Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution.
Evolution the theory that life on Earth has mutated and adapted over millions of years is the accepted theory in the biological sciences, said Mary Blythe, an elementary science specialist in the Kansas City, Kan., School District and a member of the science standards committee.
Students need to be aware of all of the scientific theories to understand science, Blythe said.
That some conservatives continue to push for creationist ideas to be taught in science classes is a concern, she said.
Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from Arkansas City, who rejects evolution.
On Wednesday he will give the other board members a different draft of the science standards written by a group of people who don't believe in evolution.
The document includes evolution and ``intelligent design'' the theory that life happened intentionally, not by chance under the heading ``historical science.''
``And instead of sitting there complaining, I thought I would propose something I liked.''
Blythe and the other members of the science committee knew that weaving evolution through the standards would be controversial, but she said she was puzzled all the same.
``I've never had a conflict with evolution,'' she said.
