While they have gotten very good at making a case for teaching alternative theories, a small group of scientists and educators stands in their way.
Most of America's children are not being taught that the world might have come into existence only 10,000 years ago, versus the nearly 4.5 billion years advocated by scientists, and this is largely because of the SWAT-like efforts of the National Center for Science Education.
The center, based in Berkeley, Calif., has four full-time employees and 4,000 members.
Within 24 hours of a call for help, Eugenie C. Scott, the executive director, jumps into action.
Operating on a ``frayed, shoestring budget,'' the center can help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools.
``They're the only group providing this kind of information for people who need it,'' said Dr. Ronald Numbers, a professor of medical history and ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and an expert on the creationist movement.
Since the center was founded in 1981, to provide a grass-roots response to creationist challenges, it has been active in all 50 states, Scott said.
Most fights over creationism vs. evolution happen at the local level, in small towns in rural states where populations are fairly homogeneous.
``You don't see it in large cities where people come from diverse backgrounds,'' she said.
Dr. Ken Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University in Providence, R.I., likened the center to ``a national fire department.''
``Whenever the scientific integrity of biology teaching is under fire or compromised,'' he said, ``the center goes there to provide support and lend resources to people who are actually fighting the fire.''
Sometimes a creationist challenge can be ``nipped in the bud'' with just a few well-chosen maneuvers, Scott said.
For example, last year the school board in Post Falls, Idaho, at the behest of creationists in the community, wrote a policy statement that would have allowed creation scientists considerable latitude in making their views known in public schools.
The Center for Science Education, contacted by a member of the community, reviewed the statement and discovered that the school district was opening itself to a violation of the laws of church and state.
The suggestions made by the center kept the school district from running afoul of those laws, and the school curriculum did not change.
In other situations, creationists prevail.
The statewide committee of 27 science teachers, which submitted the new standards to the Kansas Board of Education, was stunned two weeks ago when the Board decided to drop evolution from the required state curriculum.
The battle to keep evolution in the classroom is a David vs. Goliath struggle.
The Center for Science Education has an annual budget of $250,000, collected from members, compared with the $3 million of the Institute of Creation Research in Santee, Calif., one of several fundamentalist groups trying to discredit the teaching of evolution.
But Scott has a powerful slingshot in the form of clergy members who believe in evolution and scientists who believe in God.
When a local resident steps up before the microphone at a public hearing, says he a faithful Christian and also believes in evolution, people are mightily impressed.
According to several polls, including one reported recently in Scientific American, about 40 percent of scientists believe in God.
In local school board battles, members of the center will find such scientists in the community to testify.
Miller, for example, is both a scientist and Roman Catholic who has testified before numerous school boards on behalf of evolution.
``The fact that I'm a practicing Christian takes away their unspoken fear that everyone in science is either an atheist or agnostic,'' he said.
Science nettles advocates of creationism.
Duane Gish, senior vice president of the Institute for Creation Research, accused the center of intimidation and of ``always threatening to sue.''
``They are censors and bookburners,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``They were organized for the sole purpose of fighting creationists and to keep any evidence for creation science out of public schools.''
But, he acknowledged, ``They're effective.''
The face-offs have changed over the years as creationists have adjusted their tactics.
Early in this century, Scott said, creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution and lost.
In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws giving equal time to the teaching of creationism alongside evolution.
``Instead of fighting for equal time, they've decided to teach the evidence against evolution to balance it out,'' Scott said.
``If nothing else evolves, creationism does.''
These days, creationists have turned their attention to gaps in the fossil records and an older argument that life is so intricate and complex it could not have evolved by chance.
Their rubrics are intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory and irreducible complexity theory.
These new challenges against evolution are being made by conservative Christians at secular universities who are upset over the secularization of American society, Scott said.
They are not trying to ban evolution so much as to undermine it.
The Supreme Court ruled that teachers could teach secular and scientific alternatives to evolution, Scott said.
So the new battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory intelligent design versus Darwin.
John Richard Schrock, director of biology education at Emporia State University in Kansas and a member of the committee that worked on the state's science standards, said the center had helped them be aware of how their choice of wording could open doors for intelligent-design theorists and other creationists.
``We had to remove ambiguity,'' he said.
``They helped us with our definition of evolution as theory,'' Schrock said.
They also helped change wording in a tolerance statement promoting respect for alternative views that would not open the door to teaching religious creationism in history classes.
In the end, the School Board ignored the committee's work and voted in its own viewpoints, Schrock said.
But Scott and her staff are continuing to fight back.
The American Civil Liberties Union may decide to bring a lawsuit against the Kansas School Board, Scott said, even as other pressures are put to bear on the state.
For example, one leading software company that is looking to expand took Topeka off its list.
``That gets peoples' attention,'' she said.
