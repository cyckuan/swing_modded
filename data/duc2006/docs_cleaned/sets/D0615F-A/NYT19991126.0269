Someone created every thing in the universe, Celtie Johnson believes.
Someone made the pen she writes with.
Someone made the keyboard she types on.
All complex systems are designed by someone, so it follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer, too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan. ``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense.
She rejects the evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living things share common ancestors.
She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas science community on its ear.
Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded: - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines.
It drew objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate version of the standards.
The alternate draft, presented to the state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for months.
Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her group's standards.
She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to question evolution.
The group intends to offer the alternate science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other states.
Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member from Arkansas City, Kan., presented the alternate standards Johnson helped write.
``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan., said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of view.
``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really would be a waste of time.''
Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that God created the universe.
John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan., an evolution supporter, says Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the facts of evolution.
The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School District's science coordinator.
``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,'' McDonald said.
``If you're going to take things out of context, you can refute anything you want to refute.''
She begins many conversations with creation naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be true?''
In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts forth intelligent design the idea that an intelligent being created Earth and everything in it.
District officials said they considered the text but rejected it.
Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars.
The fliers contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the significant amount of scientific evidence against it.
Why the censorship?''
For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the universe came to be is readily available and has been for centuries.
``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a stockbroker.
``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight.''
Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution being taught.
She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory.
Many feel pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up.
She has not.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's unifying concepts.
The revised standards also omit many references to the age of Earth.
There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory the idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists'' such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years.
Creationists say they have evidence that supports this belief: - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil, but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion into account.
The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic events in the Bible, creationists say.
Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the world.
Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
