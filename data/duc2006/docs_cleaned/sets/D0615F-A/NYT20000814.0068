In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science curriculum.
The word is expected to be restored after the November school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic.
Rather, they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their children's future and the future of their state.
These dot-com times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
``There is a realization that we can't have an informed generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell, a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.
``It's their right, it's their inheritance.
Instead of seeing science as an enemy, you see it as a tool.''
The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution proponents in Kansas.
Scientists and school board candidates even the governor said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if the new science standards stayed in place.
