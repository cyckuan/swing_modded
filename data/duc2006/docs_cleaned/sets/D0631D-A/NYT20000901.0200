``Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind you,'' the control tower warned the crew of the plane, which had just lifted off at about 200 mph from Charles de Gaulle airport.
Seconds later, the Concorde's navigator said Engine 2 had malfunctioned and the pilot ordered, ``Engine fire procedure.''
Then the co-pilot warned: ``Watch out, the indicator, the indicator, the indicator!''
``It's really burning,'' the air controller told the crew, ``and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine.''
The first realization that Air France's Flight 4590 was in trouble was in those exchanges, released Thursday night on the Web site of the French Air Accident Investigation Bureau and elaborated on Friday.
Investigators still defended their July 28 assumption that an exploding tire had ruptured wing fuel tanks, starting a major fire.
It was also revealed Friday that an inspection of the runway was skipped that day because of a fire drill.
But questions began to be raised as to whether the pilot had unwittingly made a crucial mistake: Told by his navigator that Engine No.
