French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable explanation of why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into a hotel north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
The Bureau of Accident Investigations, which is looking into the causes of the crash, said in a statement that the metal strip appeared to match the shape of a gash found in one of the plane's left-side tires, and that it was `'probable that this piece caused the cut.''
Since the disaster 16 days ago, investigators have focused on the possibility that a tire blew out and that its debris damaged the plane, starting the fire.
In their statement Thursday, the investigators said that the bursting of the tire while the plane was moving down the runway at about 195 mph threw up large pieces of the tire, some of them weighing as much as 9 pounds.
The investigators steered clear of a final explanation, but they said that as a result of the debris from the tire, ``one of several fuel tanks on the left wing was very rapidly damaged, with as a consequence a very important fuel leak and fire.''
Exactly how this happened had not yet been determined, they said.
In earlier statements, the investigators had said that tire marks found on the runway after the crash showed that the aircraft had veered to the left before taking off.
They also said that in addition to traces of tire marks, pieces of a water deflector fixed above the left-side tires and debris from a fuel tank had been found on the runway.
Thursday the investigators further reported that parts of the plane's No.
