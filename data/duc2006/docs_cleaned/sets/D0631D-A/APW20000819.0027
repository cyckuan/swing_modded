For its makers, Concorde proved to be the swiftest turkey in the skies.
Hoping to sell hundreds, the British and French manufacturers persuaded airlines to take options on a total of 74.
Only 16 were built.
Protests about noise, national rivalries and an oil crisis all played a part in killing the market for supersonic airplanes.
''It's a technical miracle, but an economic disaster,'' said Ronald Davies, curator of the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and author of the book ''Supersonic Nonsense.''
''It was always bound to be uneconomical to fly,'' Davies said.
''It was costly, it wasn't big enough, and really the nail in the coffin was when the world authorities decided it wouldn't be allowed to fly over land because of the sonic boom.''
Long an emblem of luxury and technological prowess, the supersonic jet favored by the rich and famous may slip quietly into history after the July 25 crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris.
With official doubts mounting about the safety of Concorde's tires, British Airways indefinitely grounded its fleet Tuesday.
Although there always seemed to be people willing to pay the round-trip ticket price of $10,000, Concorde had its detractors from the start.
The first ominous signs might have been oil price shocks and uncertainty about whether the noisy plane would be allowed to land in New York, said Brian Trubshaw, the test pilot who flew the first British Concorde flight in 1969.
The idea of a supersonic passenger plane gained momentum in the 1950s, after Chuck Yeager's 1947 blast through the sound barrier.
Manufacturers in Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States scrambled to develop a design.
In 1962, the British Aircraft Corp. and Sud Aviation of France agreed to cooperate, along with engine builders from both countries.
In 1963, Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp. and Air France all signed options on the Concorde.
Despite the mounting excitement, Beverly Shenstone, technical director of what would later become British Airways, called Concorde ''the largest, most expensive and most dubious project ever undertaken in the development of civil aircraft.''
Nevertheless, British Airways ended up with half the world's Concorde fleet, and became its ardent defender.
In 1968, the Concorde's first prototype rolled out at Toulouse, France.
It lifted off 13 months later, three months after the Soviet version of the supersonic plane made its first flight.
Options for 74 Concordes were sold by 1967; eight each for British Overseas Airways Corp., Air France and Pan Am; six each for American Airlines, TWA, Eastern Airlines and United Air Lines; four each for Air Canada and Qantas; three each for Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa, Continental and Braniff; and two each for Air India, Middle East Airlines and Sabena.
But when final orders were placed in 1972, British Airways took five planes and Air France took four.
That was it.
Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air France took the unsold planes in 1979.
But British Airways had no place to fly the Concorde except to Bahrain when it began service in 1976.
Protests against the noisy engines and sonic booms led the U.S. government to ban Concorde landings in 1975, and they were banned in 1976 by the Port Authority of New York, which operates John F. Kennedy airport.
The market opened up after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the Port Authority's appeal.
Through the years, the airlines tried various plans to make use of its fleet, including a joint venture with Singapore Airlines and a London-Washington-Dallas tie-up with Braniff that lasted only a year.
Air France had a Paris-Washington-Mexico City service from 1978 to 1991.
At one point, there was talk of converting a Concorde to fly for Federal Express, Trubshaw says in ''Concorde: The Inside Story,'' a book whose official publication date fell on the day after the crash.
Britain and France both stopped underwriting Concorde's costs in 1984, and the two airlines took responsibility.
British Airways and Air France both insist the aircraft was profitable, but refused to give details.
Davies called the claim ''absolute nonsense.''
''Having been given the airplane, and operating it, they are able to cover the cost of the crew and the fuel and possibly the cost of the maintenance on an individual flight,'' he said.
The planes actually required eight times as much jet fuel per passenger as a 747, said Mike Stoddart of Charterhouse Securities, a London-based brokerage firm.
