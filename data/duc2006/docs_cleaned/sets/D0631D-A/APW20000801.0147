British Airways insists that demand for seats on its Concorde has not dropped off after the Air France crash a week ago, despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the British fleet of supersonic jets.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
Some days this year are worse, but the airline pointed to one recent post-crash Concorde flight from New York that arrived with 82 passengers, compared to 32 on the same date a year ago.
The plane's performance since the crash, however, hasn't helped calm fears about its safety.
Tuesday's flight to New York, with 33 of the 100 seats filled, was more than two hours late departing.
The first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out.
On Saturday, emergency services were out on the runway to attend to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud bang in an engine.
The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a refueling problem.
The day's second flight got only as far as Gander, Newfoundland, where it made an emergency landing after fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin.
British Airways operates a single round-trip flight daily between New York and London, which the airline said that is normal in August.
The French disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial operations for Concorde.
But because the Concorde makes far fewer flights than most aircraft, that one crash gave it one of the worst safety records for passenger aircraft.
Since there have only been 80,000 Concorde flights in a quarter century, the aircraft now has a rate of 12.5 fatal incidents per million flights, according to according to www.AirSafe.com, a Web site that tracks safety data.
The DC-9, which ranks second with 42 crashes, has a fatality rate of 0.72 per million flights.
British Airways has one of the better safety records, at 0.32 fatal incidents per million flights, compared to 1.19 per million for Air France, according to AirSafe data.
American Airlines has a rate of 0.53 per million, Delta 0.30 per million and United 0.50 per million.
