If so, it will be a long time before elite travelers will again be able to hop across the Atlantic in a mere three hours.
Concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for those willing to pay up to $11,000 for a round-trip ticket between New York and London or Paris.
Only 20 of the planes were ever built, and just 13 of those were still in service, seven with British Air and six with Air France, which grounded its planes immediately after the accident.
Each Concorde has 100 seats, compared with more than 400 on the largest conventional jetliners, and the planes averaged only 800 revenue hours in the air a year, about a third of a conventional plane's time at work.
Concorde's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter of economics as safety.
Preliminary investigation of the crash, which cost 113 lives, indicates that a tire was punctured by a piece of scrap metal on the Charles de Gaulle Airport runway.
Chunks of the tire ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines, which ignited escaping fuel.
Reconfiguring the plane to prevent such ruptures, by thickening the outer skin, would probably be more expensive than even such enormous fares could justify.
Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings.
But at subsonic speeds, especially during takeoffs, the roar of its jet engines and after-burners made conventional jets sound like purrs.
Noise-sensitive airports like Logan banned the craft except for occasional emergency visits.
Speed has always been the driving force in commercial travel.
Concorde's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for lowering maximum speeds.
Supersonic speed has remained a formidable barrier for most airlines, and no successor to Concorde is within sight.
So millions of air travelers will have to be content with moving around the world at a pokey 600 miles an hour.
Poor turtles.
