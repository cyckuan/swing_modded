Moments after a Concorde jet slammed into her hotel, a 21-year-old British woman jumped from a window, escaping the inferno that engulfed the building.
They were among those who escaped death in the crash Tuesday that claimed the lives of all 109 people on board the supersonic jet and four on the ground.
Alice Brooking tossed her suitcases on her hotel bed Tuesday afternoon and dialed the phone to call her sister in London.
She had just arrived for a summer job in Paris.
''All of a sudden I heard a noise.
It sounded like a normal takeoff.
It just got louder and louder until the whole building started trembling,'' Brooking recalled a day after the Concorde, smoke and flames streaming from its engines, slammed into the backside of her 40-room hotel, about two miles from Charles de Gaulle airport.
On the other end of the phone, it sounded as if ''there had been an earthquake in Paris,'' Brooking's 24-year-old sister, Natalie, recalled at a news conference Wednesday at the British Embassy in Paris.
Flames shot through Brooking's room when she opened her door, turning it into a smoke-filled oven.
She doesn't recall how far she fell, if she landed on gravel or grass, or if the hotel crumbled or exploded.
''All you could see was flames.
It was just flames everywhere,'' said Brooking, a student of linguistics at Cambridge University.
Twenty-four hours after her brush with death, Brooking said she had not yet slept and did not consider herself ''someone that had survived a miracle.''
Brooking, a tour leader, was awaiting the arrival of the Suffolk Youth Wind Band.
Their tour bus, filled with 12- to 19-year-old band members, was late arriving at the Hotelissimo, stalled in traffic after the trip from Ipswich, England.
''We could see smoke for some time and there were rescue vehicles on the road,'' said conductor Philip Shaw.
''When we arrived at the hotel it was explained just what had happened.''
The youths, who spent Wednesday at a Paris hotel recovering from shock, planned to go ahead with their five-day music program in the concert halls of the French capital.
The group of 45 Polish tourists returned from sightseeing to find their hotel ablaze.
''We were totally unaware of what had happened,'' Maciej Kuznik, the group's guide, told Poland's private Radio Zet.
''All of a sudden we see the road blocked, and we hear our hotel is completely burned down.''
''We are still in shock and very tired,'' he said.
All their belongings and some passports were destroyed.
Air France paid for their stay Tuesday night in a Paris hotel and offered compensation for the loss of some possessions.
One survivor wept quietly at the Polish Embassy in Paris on Wednesday, saying she had lost ''everything ... even my most beautiful outfit.''
The crash killed two young Poles, Ewa Lipinska and Paulina Sypko, both students at a hotel school in Poland.
''Only dust remained.
What will I take home?''
