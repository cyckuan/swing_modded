metal strip that investigators believe may have led to the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency investigating the disaster said on Monday.
The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of rubber to pierce the plane's fuel tanks, was reported missing by Continental.
``The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French agency said.
In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece could well have come from a Continental plane that was on its way to Newark, N.J., from Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris.
The investigative agency's latest statement came on a day when Air France officials said they believed it was unlikely that the remaining sleek-needle nosed supersonic jets belonging to Air France and British Air would fly again before April, at the earliest.
The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at a press conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the government and the plane's manufacturers to try to come up with modifications that would insure the safety of the plane.
The modifications would then have to be tested, and only then would Air France and British Air the only two airlines that fly Concordes discuss whether to return the aircraft to service.
The French agency described the piece of metal that may have triggered the crash that killed 113 people as ``a part of a hood on the plane's reverse thrusters.''
In a statement, Continental said the 17-inch by one-inch piece of metal found on the runway was ``similar'' in shape to a piece found missing from its DC10.
The piece, it said, was ``missing from the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right wing engine.''
The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ``does not affect the safe operation of an aircraft.''
Just last week, French investigators disclosed that one of three daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris such as the metal strip had been skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire drill.
The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about 12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.
But the news that the piece had fallen off the Continental flight pointed out that the runway inspections would not have prevented the disaster.
