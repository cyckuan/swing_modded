wedding rings, teeth, scraps of clothing -- that might help identify the victims of the doomed Concorde flight.
As relatives paid tribute in Paris to the 113 people killed when their burning Air France Concorde jet plunged to earth Tuesday, experts converged on the crash site in this town of factories and pastures to begin the painstaking task of putting names to bodies.
By nightfall Thursday, all the bodies had been transported to a morgue in eastern Paris for autopsies, said Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the regional police headquarters.
But some 40 experts continued their grueling work at the site in Gonesse, a gritty industrial suburb north of Paris, which was cordoned off and heavily guarded by police.
''The bodies are terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's impossible to recognize them,'' Tillon said.
For every plane crash in France, the Catastrophe Victim Identification Unit follows these steps, according to the police force that oversees the unit: First, specialists rush to the scene of the crash, dividing the crash site into quadrants and assigning each team a patch.
Team members turn over clumps of earth, charred cinders and pieces of metal from the plane during the search for the victims' bodies and possessions.
They number each body or body fragment, mark the spot with a traffic cone or a pole, and snap pictures.
Units begin calling the families, requesting details that might help identify the remains: hair color, broken bones, jewelry, tattoos.
Dental records are crucial, as the bodies are often unrecognizable.
The bodies are transported to the morgue for autopsies.
German Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt, who went to Paris after the crash to follow the investigation and comfort relatives of the German victims, said he doubted the remains would be returned to Germany quickly.
''It's very difficult because no identification was possible,'' he told the Saarbruecker Zeitung paper.
''It will take even longer with some victims.''
