French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
The panel of experts, including French aviation authorities and Air France representatives, was working to establish the chain of events that led to the disaster and make a recommendation to the Transportation Ministry.
The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly, Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, said after the meeting.
But he said experts still had to clarify a number of key issues before a ban on Air France Concorde flights is lifted.
The meeting came a day after French authorities established a special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were killed.
The unit includes 44 members of the French national police and three judicial experts.
Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris.
It was the first crash ever of the sleek jet, once the pride of French aviation.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the crash.
Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.
Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday quoted Gayssot, the transport minister, as raising the possibility that the ban on Air France Concorde flights could remain in place until the Accident and Inquiry Office releases a preliminary report on the crash at the end of August.
So far, the Accident and Inquiry Office, which is part of the Transportation Ministry, has said that flames spewing from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a major fuel leak.
On Thursday, a spokesman for the Accident and Inquiry Office declined to comment on a report in USA Today that quoted unidentified sources as saying investigators were trying to determine whether a piece of Flight 4590's landing gear broke off before takeoff, leading to a fuel leak.
On Wednesday, some 100 technicians carefully removed two engines from the site of the crash to a special location at Dugny, near Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., which is the only tire supplier for the Air France Concorde fleet, has sent two specialists to France to aid in the inquiry.
