The research, based on detailed photographs from the Galileo spacecraft, shows how the extreme ebb and flow of tides in a subsurface ocean may have flexed the ice surface and created the elaborate patterns of curving cracks and ridges on Europa that are unlike anything else seen in the solar system.
Planetary scientists from the University of Arizona concluded in a report being published Friday in the journal Science that the findings make Europa a prime target in the search for life beyond Earth.
Where there is so much liquid water, scientists speculate, there just might be some elemental forms of life.
Ever since a Voyager spacecraft flew by Europa in 1979, scientists have entertained the intriguing possibility of a global ocean below its surface.
The ocean, warmed by Europa's interior heat, could extend as deep as 100 miles, 20 times greater than Earth's oceans.
Its ice crust could be up to eight or 10 miles thick.
Europa is about the size of Earth's moon.
The Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter and its four largest satellites since 1995, has produced pictures at closer range that strengthened the global-ocean hypothesis.
But scientists were puzzled by the chains of scalloped, or cycloidal, fracture lines that ran for hundreds of miles across the frozen surface of Europa.
Scientists think the distinctive patterns of the fracture lines reveal their origins and confirm the notion of a Europan ocean.
The Arizona planetary scientists, led by Dr. Gregory Hoppa, theorized that Jupiter's huge size it is 300 times as massive as Earth causes tremendous tidal stresses on Europa.
The tidal ebb and flow would be especially pronounced on a body of liquid water.
According to their model, Europa's ocean tides must rise and fall some 100 feet, compared with Earth tides of about 4 to 6 feet.
Europa's slightly eccentric orbit, the scientists said, contribute to the tidal forces that created the cycloid shapes of the fracture lines.
When Europa is closer to Jupiter, the tides are higher because the planet's gravitational tug is greater.
When Europa is farther away, the tides fall.
This causes Europa's ice shell to flex and crack.
The crack would propagate slowly across the ever-changing stress field, describing an arc.
The scientists using the model say each arc segment in the scalloped lines forms in 3.5 days, which happens to be the time it takes Europa to make one complete orbit around Jupiter.
Each arc ranges from 45 miles to 120 miles in length.
In a telephone interview, Hoppa, of the university's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, said, ``The only way this model works is if there is a significant water layer below the ice.
Only if there is a liquid water ocean could there be tides that would account for the surface features we see.''
Other members of the Arizona team are Dr. B. Randall Tufts, Dr. Richard Greenberg and Dr. Paul Geissler.
The scientists caution that the findings do not necessarily mean there is still a liquid ocean under Europa's ice, only that there was one there when the surface markings were formed.
Other planetary scientists agreed, but noted that the relative absence of cratering on Europa indicated that the strong ocean tidal forces must have existed in the recent past.
They could not think of any obvious reason why the liquid ocean would have disappeared in recent times.
Dr. Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University in Tempe, a member of the Galileo science team, said, ``The likelihood is that, yes, there are liquid oceans on Europa, but we can't say that definitively with the information available now.''
Because of increasing interest in Europa's watery past or present, NASA is making plans for a spacecraft to be launched in 2003 and go into an orbit of the Jovian moon in 2008.
Its remote-sensing instruments are to include ice-penetrating radar to establish once and for all if there are still oceans on Europa.
