There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then Saturn in the early 1970s.
Its five-watt radio signal could still be heard, a decade later, as Pioneer became the first machine of human design to leave the sun's planetary system.
And there was Voyager 2.
Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s.
Looking back, Voyager 2 was still able to take a family portrait of the planets, specks of light dancing around a stellar maypole.
In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the scientific mind.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
In an especially close encounter with Europa last month, the spacecraft picked up strong signals of peculiar changes in Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa.
It is the most compelling evidence so far, scientists said last week, of an electrically conducting material in Europa's subsurface, like an ocean of salty water.
Since liquid water is an essential ingredient of life, these intriguing clues have encouraged speculation that the first extraterrestrial life, however simple, may be found in the seas of Europa.
Dr. Christopher Chyba of Stanford University proposed that in the absence of sunlight for photosynthesis, the radiation bombardment ``should produce organic and oxidant molecules sufficient to fuel a substantial Europan biosphere.''
Galileo's enduring successes have been a happy surprise in view of its early prospects, which were none too bright.
Launched in 1989, Galileo took six years getting to Jupiter by a circuitous route dictated by the power limitations at its sendoff.
The spacecraft's full capability has been hobbled by the failure of the main antenna to unfurl and the erratic behavior of a tape recorder.
In the last year, repeated zappings from Jupiter's intense radiation belts have damaged some spacecraft instruments.
``In general, the spacecraft is reasonably healthy,'' said James K. Erickson, the project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``We've survived much longer than anyone thought we would.''
As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going ``well past its warranty.''
Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of two more years.
It has now been given another lease on life, beginning Tuesday.
The length of the lease is problematic.
Fuel for maneuvering the craft is running low.
Its gyroscopes for navigating are on their last legs.
And officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are debating the cost-effectiveness of operating Galileo for the full 14 additional months of operations requested by scientists and engineers of the project.
Their eagerness to keep Galileo going has been fed by its most recent observations, especially those revealing the four largest Jovian moons to be spectacularly diverse worlds.
They were discovered in 1610 by the spacecraft's namesake, Galileo Galilei, who recognized in their orbits a kind of solar system in miniature but had no inkling of what they looked like.
Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa.
Scientists wanted a better look at this ice-covered moon, about the size of Earth's moon.
They were intrigued by the many cracks running for a thousand miles or more across an otherwise fairly smooth crater-free surface.
The cracked landscape reminded them of broken glass repaired by an icy glue oozing up from below.
This and other aspects of the surface geology suggested that a layer of liquid water could lie beneath the outer shell of ice.
Scientists reasoned that the strong tidal forces of Jupiter caused regular expansions and contractions of Europa.
The flexing is the most likely source of the heat in the moon's interior needed to melt a layer of water between its outer icy surface and its rocky interior, at a depth of perhaps 60 miles.
Such conjecture has stirred wide interest among scientists because liquid water is one of the essential ingredients of life.
On Jan. 3, Galileo flew within 218 miles of Europa, about the altitude that space shuttles often maintain above Earth and close enough for detailed observations by the spacecraft's magnetometer.
Europa lies within Jupiter's magnetic field, which changes direction in the vicinity of Europa every five and a half hours.
This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like an ocean of salt water.
Galileo, scientists reported, detected the kind of magnetic disturbances that would be predicted if the Jovian magnetic-field variations had produced an electric current through a conductor on Europa.
Rock and solid ice are poor electrical conductors, but a salt-water ocean would be perfect.
``I'm cautious by nature, but this new evidence certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more persuasive.''
``Nobody I've talked to has come up with a challenge to this interpretation,'' she said.
Kivelson said that if the full Galileo mission extension was approved, the magnetometer would be looking to see whether this same type of phenomenon occurred on Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury.
Earlier, the spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has its own strong magnetic field, indicating that its core is a fluid metal, which boils in a way that generates the magnetism and also heats other parts of its interior.
More surprising to scientists are the hints that Callisto, the outermost of the largest Jovian moons, may also have a subsurface ocean.
Callisto does not appear to have an undifferentiated interior with a dense core and other distinct layers.
Nor is it subject to the same flexing tidal forces that heat up the closer moons.
But the Galileo magnetometer has observed that Callisto seems to cause the same kind of changes in the Jovian magnetic field as those detected at Europa.
In an article in the current issue of Scientific American, Dr. Torrence V. Johnson, the Galileo chief scientist, wrote: ``Somehow Callisto must be hot enough to support an ocean but not so hot that light and heavy materials separate.
The water layer might be sandwiched between a radioactively heated interior, where convection keeps the material mixed, and a thin icy shell, where a different convection cycle cools the ocean.''
Flight controllers did not dare send Galileo into the blizzard of Jovian radiation surrounding Io, the innermost of the major moons, until all other mission objectives had been accomplished.
For all they knew, the radiation bombardment would disable or destroy the spacecraft.
But scientists had to get a closer look at the churning forces of Io, which the two Voyagers had discovered to be the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
Galileo's first flyby, at a distance of 380 miles in October, produced sharp pictures of Io's pizza-pie surface of brown, red and yellow minerals; red-hot flows of lava at temperatures of 2,700 degrees; collapsing mountains, and fulminating volcanoes, more than 100 of them spewing lava and venting vapor plumes miles into space.
Scientists found Io to be an even more explosive fire-and-brimstone place than they previously suspected.
``Io makes Dante's Inferno seem like another day in paradise,'' said Dr. Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson, a member of the Galileo photo analysis team.
Galileo survived the encounter, but not without some radiation hits causing erratic performance of spacecraft electronics.
More than a month later, on Thanksgiving Day, the spacecraft was sent even closer to Io, 186 miles away.
Blasted even harder by radiation, Galileo automatically turned off its cameras and science instruments to protect them.
Flight engineers quickly radioed commands to take the craft out of this safe mode and give it new operating instructions, including software ``patches'' to work around damaged components and unscramble garbled picture data.
One spectacular picture caught a fiery fountain of lava shooting more than a mile above the surface.
The erupting lava was so hot and bright, the project scientist Johnson said, that it blinded part of the camera's electronic sensors and created a white blur in the middle of the picture.
While the volcanoes of Io sometimes reminded scientists of the lava flows and pools at Kilauea in Hawaii, they are really like nothing existing on Earth and in much of the solar system since its formative period over four billion years ago.
``Io is the next-best thing to traveling back in time to Earth's earlier years,'' Johnson said.
``It gives us an opportunity to watch in action phenomena long dead in the rest of the solar system.''
On Feb. 22, Galileo is scheduled to make one more close flyby of Io.
Two encounters with Ganymede are being planned for May and December.
Otherwise, Galileo's agenda is not clear, pending a NASA decision on whether to go ahead with a full 14-month extension called the Galileo Millennium Mission.
Scientists are still puzzled by the wide variations in radiation levels in Jupiter's neighborhood.
Engineers would like to fly Galileo longer as a test of its performance in this harsh environment.
The spacecraft has already been exposed to twice the radiation levels it was designed to withstand, and continuing study could yield clues to improve the durability of future spacecraft.
On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans for a spacecraft to orbit Europa, perhaps as early as 2008, and to use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.
