The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
The chemical composition of the planet, which hasn't changed for 5,000 million years, is almost exactly like the sun's, a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.
Information sent back by Galileo shows that the central regions of Jupiter are much hotter than previously believed and winds around Jupiter exceeded 400mph, almost 100mph faster than hitherto thought.
These winds are driven by heat escaping from the planet's core.
