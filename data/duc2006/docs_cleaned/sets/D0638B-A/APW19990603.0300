Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday.
Some scientists had suggested oceans exist beneath the frozen surface on Europa, boosting theories that life could develop on Jupiter's fourth-largest moon.
The ocean theory was suggested by data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft.
But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper published in the journal Science.
``You're not going to find fish swimming in the Europan ocean,'' said Joseph Kirschvink, one of the authors and a professor of geobiology at the California Institute of Technology.
Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said.
``We hate to throw cold water on it, but ... it's basically a smothered planet,'' Kirschvink said.
It's possible that Europan organisms could derive their energy from rust, which is oxidized iron, or through some other source.
``But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live on these energy sources,'' said Eric Gaidos, the paper's lead author and a geobiologist at Caltech.
