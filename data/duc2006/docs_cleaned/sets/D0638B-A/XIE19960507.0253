The Jupiter's volcano-pocked moon Io has been found by the Galileo spacecraft to have a giant iron core that takes up half its diameter, reported the May 3 issue of the Science magazine.
From the data taken by Galileo, scientists have determined that Io has a two-layer structure.
At the center is a metallic core, probably made of iron and iron sulfide, about 560 miles in radius, which is overlain by a mantle of partily molten rock and crust.
The probe also has detected a large hole in the Jupiter's magnetic field near Io, leading to speculation about whether Io possesses its own magnetic field.
If so, it would be the first planetary moon known to have one.
This new information of Io may be related to the intense heating of the moon caused by the constant squeezing and distortion of Io in the Jupiter's powerful gravitational grip, according to Galileo Project Scientist Dr. Torrence Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Galileo was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989.
It took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of the Jupiter's moon last December 7, as the probe passed by Io on its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter.
Io is less than a third of the Earth's size, but it generates twice as much heat as the Earth.
