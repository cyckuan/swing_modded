Discover magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy surface.
The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles below the ice.
The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly carbonated.
Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the moon's face.
The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic wavelengths of light.
The wavelengths measured by Galileo's spectrometer from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer infrared wavelengths can thus reveal the chemical makeup of Europa's surface.
When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured the characteristic spectrum of water ice no surprise there.
But when the instrument examined features like the many dark lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals, including natron and Epsom salts.
Such salts, McCord says, form only in the presence of liquid water.
``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,'' McCord says.
The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have recorded.
Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is extensive and well mixed.
The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is probably dissolved in the water.
On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,'' McCord says.
``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time, so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer water.''
Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it could erupt through the ice to the surface.
(This could explain the origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts behind.
As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor.
``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be hydrothermal vents.''
There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't exist in oceans on worlds other than our own.
In fact, the Mars Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of hematite a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity near Mars' equator.
If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for past life on Mars.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable for life.
``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean.
It's one more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for life.''
