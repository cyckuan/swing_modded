Acting President Vladimir Putin defended the Russian armed forces on Tuesday, calling talk of the army's collapse ``an open lie.''
``This is unfair and disrespectful to our soldiers and officers, especially those now fighting in Chechnya,'' Putin declared during a whirlwind visit to the southern Russian city of Volgograd.
Putin's visit came on the eve of Defender of the Fatherland Day, a major military holiday.
The Russian military has been in steady decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and its reputation suffered huge damage during the last war in Chechnya, in 1994-96.
Soldiers are underfed, underpaid and barely trained, and Russia's economic woes mean the army hasn't received new weapons in years.
Hazing is fierce and endemic.
Desertion, suicide, and alcoholism are rampant in the ranks, and corruption is widespread among officers.
But Putin, who has championed the current war in Chechnya, said that talk of the military's demise was wrong.
``The army is fulfilling its duties as it should.''
Since coming to power on Dec. 31 following Boris Yeltsin's resignation, the Soviet KGB veteran has repeatedly stressed his intention to enhance Russia's military might.
He has moved to increase Russia's defense budget and weapons purchases from the ailing military-industrial complex.
In Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, Putin walked through the imposing Mamayev Hill memorial, which marks some of the Soviet Union's heaviest battles of World War II.
He spoke with veterans who had defended the city against Nazi forces, and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
Putin also conferred with regional officials and toured a military hospital, chatting with wounded soldiers.
Upon hearing doctors' requests for additional funds, Putin immediately ordered $347,200 to be given to the hospital.
His trip, heavily covered by Russian state media, was also a campaign swing.
It came a day after the Central Elections Commission completed the registration of candidates for the March 26 presidential election.
Putin leads the pack of 11 contenders and is expected to win easily.
