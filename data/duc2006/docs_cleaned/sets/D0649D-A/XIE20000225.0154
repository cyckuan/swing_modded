Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin said here Friday that Russia needed a tougher struggle against crime and terrorism.
Putin made the remarks in an open letter to the voters about his program for the upcoming presidential election.
"As we have been talking for years about fighting crime, that evil was continuing to entrench itself everywhere.
But we attacked the gangsters and defeated them.
This was the first step towards the preeminence of the law, to the dictatorship of a law that treats everybody equally," he wrote in a letter which was published in the Friday issue of Russian newspaper Izvestiya.
"Wherever the terrorist and criminal is now hiding, he cannot hope to find refuge in Chechnya.
The letter consists of two parts: "Our Problems" and "Our Priorities".
Russia's greatest problems are the loss of will power, the state's loss of will to bring to completion what it has started, hesitation and the habit to put off the most difficult activities, Putin writes.
"It has gone so far that a whole republic, namely Chechnya, succumbed to the criminal world," Putin says.
He is sure that "it was necessary to meet the challenge on the enemy's field and to rout him there."
Russia's second "big problem", Putin believes, "is lack of firm and universally recognized rules."
"Order requires rules.
And it is best for those who are now busy juggling concepts, claiming that lack of order means genuine democracy, to stop seeking dirty tricks and scaring us with the past," it says.
The state must set firm and generally accepted rules to ensure legality and democracy in all spheres including the economy, Putin says.
"The state must begin with itself.
It must set equal rules and comply with them," he stressed.
"Only an efficient and strong state can afford to live by the rule of law, and individual is freer in a stronger country," he says.
The third problem is that the state is insufficiently aware of its resources, Putin notes.
Putin prioritized "the fight against our own poverty."
The debt to the elderly should be reimbursed.
"It's not just a social but a political and moral task," he says.
Putin admitted that money is needed to "do away with humiliation by poverty," but "a further ballooning of our already large social security budget is not the right method."
On Russia's foreign policy, Putin emphasizes that "the external policy should be shaped in the national interests of our own country."
Essentially, the priority of domestic goals over foreign goals should be recognized, he writes.
