Vladimir Putin, the man Boris N. Yeltsin nominated Monday as Russia's prime minister and his preferred successor as president, is a former spy, a shrewd bureaucratic operator and a completely inexperienced public politician.
Little is known about his political or economic views.
Nevertheless, in a televised address Monday, Yeltsin said that Putin was the man who would unite the country, consolidate reforms and lead Russia into the next century.
``He will be able to unite those who will renew Russia's greatness in the 21st century,'' said Yeltsin in a nationally televised speech Monday.
Almost immediately, Putin announced his candidacy for presidential elections that are 11 months away, saying he had not been planning to run but was accustomed to obeying orders and would seek Russia's top office if that was Yeltsin's wish.
Analysts said that Putin, a dour and colorless figure, would be a tough sell for the Russian electorate.
Putin was nominated prime minister Monday after Yeltsin fired Sergey Stepashin, who served just under three months in the job.
Prior to his nomination, Putin was director of the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the feared Soviet KGB, where he served for 15 years as an agent.
Throughout his career Putin has been a bureaucratic infighter and a master of behind-the-scenes political intrigues.
After graduating from Leningrad State University in 1975 with a degree in law, Putin served in the KGB's foreign intelligence wing, where he spent long tours of duty in Germany.
In 1990 he began working in St. Petersburg's local government as an aide to Anatoly Sobchak, that city's mayor from 1991 until 1996.
He earned the nickname of Sobchak's ``gray cardinal,'' an ominous phrase in Russian which refers to figures who wield influence behind the scenes.
Sobchak's opponents accused Putin of employing the KGB-like methods in his government work of intimidating the courts and twisting the arms of legislators.
Supposedly, he used tactics such as compiling dossiers on Sobchak's opponents to force their cooperation.
``In the St. Petersburg government Putin operated according to the specifics of his previous profession,'' said Alexander Belyayev, who in the early 1990s served as speaker of St. Petersburg's City Council.
Following Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, Putin's career took off.
Yeltsin brought him to Moscow where he became the Kremlin's corruption watchdog.
In July 1998, he was promoted to director of Russia's security services.
Although Putin is widely viewed as a liberal, on his watch the Federal Security Service prosecuted environmentalists Alexander Nikitin and Grigory Pasko, naval officers who were accused of espionage for exposing Russia's slipshod handling of nuclear waste.
It has also shamelessly protected the Kremlin's political interests, often ignoring the rule of law in the process.
