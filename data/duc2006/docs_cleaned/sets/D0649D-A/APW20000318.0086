With his standing in the polls dipping, acting President Vladimir Putin urged voters Saturday to elect him with a clear majority to avoid a second round, but denied that he's worried about winning.
On a campaign trip to the southern city of Voronezh, Putin was cautious about the outcome of the March 26 election, saying he would prefer a clear decision to avoid a runoff.
But he said his call was based solely on a desire to save the country the expense of a second-round vote.
Recent polls show support for Putin down by 2 to 3 percentage points compared to the 60 percent he had received in recent weeks.
Putin's nearest rival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, trails with about 20 percent, while most of the other candidates barely show up in the polls.
It's the result that matters,'' Putin said Friday.
On Saturday, Putin said the first round of voting will cost about $5.3 million.
If a second round is necessary two weeks later, it will cost an additional $3.5 million, he said.
''This is nearly as much as all the pensions paid in the Moscow region,'' Putin said in an interview with the Mayak radio station aired Saturday.
Putin said if he wins, there will be no room in his administration for the business moguls who amassed so much influence under Boris Yeltsin that they became known as Russia's ''oligarchs.''
''Such a class of oligarchs will cease to exist,'' he said.
''We will work with all layers of society.''
The centrist Unity political party, which strongly backs Putin, issued a call Saturday to young people to vote for Putin, urging them not to be apathetic or assume the election outcome is a foregone conclusion.
Putin ''has a historic chance to pull Russia out of crisis and lead the country on the path of dynamic and stable development,'' the movement said in a statement.
Putin, whose tough stance on the war in Chechnya has buoyed his popularity, said he will not repeat the mistakes of the last Chechen war, when Russian forces were defeated by rebels.
The 1996 withdrawal from Chechnya was a mistake, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
''We have already left once,'' he said.
Putin said most of the rebel forces in Chechnya have been eliminated, and some Russian troops could soon be withdrawn.
But he said rebels could still unite into groups and commit terrorism.
''It means that we will leave the amount of armed forces necessary to deal with these issues,'' he said.
