But while the research, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, established the inverse relationship, the authors found in questioning study participants that there was no ``significant relationship'' between the amount of vitamin C that people ate and their blood-lead levels.
Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco studied data collected from 19,578 participants, ages 6 through 90, who did not have a history of lead poisoning.
The participants had taken part in a national health survey from 1988 to 1994.
Co-author of the study, Dr. Joel S. Simon, said that previous studies have found increased dietary amounts of vitamin C linked with lower blood-lead levels.
He said that his and his colleagues' inability to find a dietary relationship may have been attributable to ``imprecise'' questionnaire wording.
He also suggested that high lead levels flush ascorbic acid out of the system more quickly, lowering the ascorbic acid level in the blood.
Ouch-free monitor device promising for diabetics Checking the body's blood sugar levels at home could get less painful for people with diabetes.
GlucoWatch biographer, an experimental watch-like device, has been shown to be as effective as current self-monitoring techniques that require pricking a finger to get blood samples, according to a report released Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association meeting in San Diego.
The device, which is worn on the arm, electrochemically measures the glucose levels in tiny amounts of fluid found between cells beneath the skin's surface.
When the fluid reacts with an enzyme on a small disposable pad, a glucose measurement can be made.
The device would allow people with diabetes to check their glucose levels up to 36 times a day.
The results of the readings were nearly identical with those done by pricking the finger to draw blood.
GlucoWatch awaits US Food and Drug Administration approval, and is unlikely to be made commercially available for at least a year.
The device could cost about $300 and the disposable sensor pads about $4.
The study, led by Peter S. Jensen, a child and adolescent psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, found that fewer than one in eight children with ADHD were prescribed the stimulant medications.
It will appear in the July 1999 Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
The results came from a 1992 sample of nearly 1,300 children and their parents in Atlanta, New Haven, Westchester, N.Y., and San Juan.
About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD, and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated with stimulant drugs in the past year.
The report found that ADHD children were generally more likely to receive other forms of treatment, such as in-school services or mental health counseling, than medication.
Stimulants are considered the best treatment, according to Jensen's study.
His report acknowledges that there have been well-documented studies showing that the number of children receiving stimulants is increasing, although little information is known as to why that is occurring.
But his report suggests that there are ``many children with ADHD going unidentified and untreated.''
