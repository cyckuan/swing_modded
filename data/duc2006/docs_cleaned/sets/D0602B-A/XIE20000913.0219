Two positive doping tests were announced on Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games.
The cheaters were strongman Chen Po-pu of Chinese Taipei, and woman triple jumper Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria.
Chen became the first athlete to be expelled from the Olympics for a positive test of methandienone, and Prandzheva tested positive for the steroid nandrolone.
Prandzheva, a silver medallist at the 1995 world championships, was caught for taking drugs at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
She was banned for two years for taking methandienone.
Chen, who took silver and bronze medals at world junior competitions in 1997 and 1998, had been due to compete in the 62 kg category.
