The human aspect should be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization Committee said Saturday.
At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive for steroid.
"Athletes are not machines.
They are human beings, and every human makes mistake, " Puello said.
"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to acknowledge that you made mistakes."
Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he said."
She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in every aspect of her life."
The media also has an important role to play, he said, they should protect her instead of crucifying her.
Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold medal since the beginning of the Games.
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big mistake," Dr. Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican Commission said.
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken.
It's exetremely important for us to know where she got it."
Stonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.
