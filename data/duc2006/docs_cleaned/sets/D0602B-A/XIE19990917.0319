The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) has pressed for the national federations of Cuba and Jamaica to impose ban on high jumper Javier Sotomayor and sprinter Merlene Ottey for doping failures.
"It is a normal procedure and we do that in every doping case as soon as the B samples prove positive too, regardless of the athlete's fame or celebrity," IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
The urge came as Cuban authorities repeatedly said they would stand by Sotomayor, the world record holder, who failed a dope test for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
The athletics' world ruling body also prompted the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) to take action against Ottey, whose second urine sample had just been tested positive.
The JAAA will conduct a hearing by November to determine whether it will suspend Ottey from competitions for two years.
Ottey tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland in July and the IAAF disclosed Thursday that the 39-year-old sprinter's "B" sample on September 2, the second urine test, also has tested positive for the drug.
"There are international rules regarding athletes who have had positive dope tests and they should be applied by all national federations.
"But it is up to the national federation to make a decision."
