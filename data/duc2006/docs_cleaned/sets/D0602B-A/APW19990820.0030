Two Moroccan female athletes have been stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an official said Friday.
Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee.
Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig.
``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem said.
``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field events.
No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said.
He said most gold medal winners were tested.
Suspicions about Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters.
The track and field events were held Aug. 11-14 while the games formally opened on Aug. 15 for other events.
On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for Nandrolone.
In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers tarnished by positive tests.
Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal.
The Arab Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban athletes.
Bans imposed by international organizations range between two months and life.
The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan, rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan athletes.
``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the country of working with steroids.
We have 100 percent confidence in the tests and everything has been conducted according to the international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said.
Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon.
Twelve athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.
