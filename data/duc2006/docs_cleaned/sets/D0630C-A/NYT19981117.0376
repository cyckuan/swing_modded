packing, shipping and delivery has become a key to its future.
With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
The announcement this month that the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.
There is a basic explanation for the dazzle of distribution.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Such top booksellers as Barnes Noble and Amazon.com are looking for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by sending more of their orders through their own distribution centers.
For consumers, this means that delivery will become swifter, setting a standard of 24-hour service for online bookstores, but also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by stores on terra firma.
While top publishers troll for new alliances to share distribution, regional distributors are on a spree of buying smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure a customer base.
Daily there is speculation that Amazon.com, the e-commerce pioneer, is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own.
Meanwhile, the Yankee Group, a technology research organization, forecasts that online sales of books will climb to $700 million by the end of this year.
Worried that they will be left by the wayside, restive independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into their records.
``They'll be able to find out what our sales are, what the profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores are and then move in,'' said William Petrocelli, the co-owner of Book Passage, an independent store in Corte Madera, Calif., just north of San Francisco.
He is circulating a letter among booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators.
The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers, including four new ones in Nashville.
Last week it also announced the hiring of a new chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, who, when he was chief executive of Ingram Distribution Group, presided over the expansion of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade books in the world.
The book and distribution groups are both owned by Ingram Industries.
``We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset, but frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition didn't pay much attention to it,'' said Robert F. DiRomualdo, chairman of the Borders Group.
``We've got to become more efficient as an industry, so I'm not surprised that everyone is moving in that direction.''
Barnes Noble's purchase of Ingram is just the most visible example of the industry shift.
According to several top publishing executives, Amazon.com had also been talking with Nashville-based Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker Taylor, the No.
