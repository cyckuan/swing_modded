The reviews are in for last year's books and the reading is not pleasant.
The widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even as demand has fallen for mass-market paperback books and as affluent, educated readers buy fewer titles, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade group that tracks the reading habits of 16,000 households.
That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
During the discussion, he insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
But the new consumer-research study indicates that sales over all declined almost 3 percent, to 1.04 billion books purchased literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of booksellers.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent.
The large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to 25.3 percent, reflecting their own slowing expansion of brick-and-bookshelf stores.
The rest of the bookselling market includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains to food and drug stores.
With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they were not reaching more readers.
The downturn in sales comes as the economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400 companies.
Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers.
By necessity, those booksellers are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of their own, Book Sense, which has now signed up more than 860 members.
Avin Domnitz, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said the study reflected other research the trade group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book Sense site on the World Wide Web.
``Young people, in particular,'' Domnitz said, are ``so busy and so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on their priority list.''
That group is reading, he noted not necessarily traditional books but perhaps information on line.
Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the falling popularity of paperbacks; those books once ushered in a revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy portability.
The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on used bookstores, book clubs, mail-order companies, even drugstores all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
Mass-market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores reflecting a shift in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks.
Cost may also have driven away potential customers: the average price of paid for a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation over the last five years, rising to $4.56 from $4.12 in 1994.
To deal with the age factor, the Association of American Publishers has created an publicity campaign featuring celebrity bookworms and a slogan, ``Get Caught Reading,'' to try to reach the young, but there's heavy work ahead.
In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent.
Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal, the study showed, buying 15 percent more books.
Readers with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are usually heavy book-buyers, but last year they also cut back.
In general, readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on nonfiction, like biographies and history, which declined in sales by 12 percent.
The customers younger than 40 who did shift to online book-shopping displayed rather different reading tastes than those of the general market.
Popular fiction topped E-commerce sales at 33 percent, followed by 14 percent for technical and science books, 12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for psychological and recovery books.
In the general market, popular fiction has a much more commanding presence 51 percent followed by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent .
The study notes that religious-book buyers did not seem to respond to electronic bookstores, but did buy enough titles in other outlets to expand the segment's share of the market by more than 1 percent.
Over all, customers bought fewer books in every category except in categories for travel and religion.
Domnitz, whose organization helped finance the study, still believes there is a potential for expanding the market.
``The problem is that about half of the population is not going to purchase books in the course of a year,'' he said.
``And so we have to concentrate on those who do.''
