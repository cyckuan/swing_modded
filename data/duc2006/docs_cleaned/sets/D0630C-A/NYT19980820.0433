With competition intensifying among electronic booksellers, Barnes Noble Inc. announced Thursday that it would sell shares to the public of its money-losing online venture, which trails in sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com.
Barnes Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's $147.8 million.
The initial public offering could take place in the next 30 days, the company said.
``They're using the IPO to televise that they have online capability, and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes Noble stock, which is going to retain 80 percent'' of the online venture, said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn. Shares of Barnes Noble rose 7.5 percent Thursday, or $2.8125, to $40.0625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the overall stock market has recently slumped, some new issues of Web-based businesses, like Geocities, have risen sharply.
At the same time Barnes Noble announced its plans for a public offering, the company said that its loss for the second quarter tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss from the online venture.
Barnes Noble reported a loss of $5.7 million, or 8 cents a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of $1.37 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Revenue rose 9.3 percent, to $675 million.
The results were in line with Wall Street analysts' forecasts.
Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions, Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes Noble in New York, declined to answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering or how the proceeds would be used.
Typically, when a company spins off a division it could mean that the unit's executives will get more independence and stock option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company, Ms. Killian of Renaissance Capital said.
``It would make them more competitive with Amazon.com,'' she said.
During the summer, Barnes Noble hired several top executives for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer, and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives, John Rindlaub Jr., comes with marketing experience from Shoplink Inc., a PC-based grocery shopping and home delivery company.
The chief executive of the online venture will remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes Noble, whose roots are in traditional bookselling.
The number of users of the company's Web site (www.barnesandnoble.com) has continued to grow, with 720,000 customers by early August, compared with 500,000 last May.
These gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer one-click ordering.
The online division is also preparing to introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected 1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million.
The New York office of TBWA Chiat/Day was named last month to handle the account.
But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with the entry of the German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG, which is expected to open its online store, Booksonline, in Europe and the United States in the fall.
The Borders Group Inc. started its online bookstore earlier this year although the company, the second-largest bookstore retailer, has been concentrating more on overseas expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in London and Singapore.
