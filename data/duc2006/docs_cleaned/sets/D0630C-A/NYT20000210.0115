Inside the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop, the e-commerce revolution seems improbable, like a setting ripped from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel on the store's dusty shelves.
Owner Vincent McCaffrey would have it no other way.
Hence, the resident cat, Blue, who sleeps in the front window, the classical music, and the hand-scrawled sign that says ``Please Touch The Books.''
However, the charming store encloses a hidden world, one where touching the books is impossible, where silence reigns, and where Blue is nothing more than a flickering image.
It's called AvenueVictorHugoBooks.com, and last year, it generated 6 percent of McCaffrey's sales.
``For us to survive, it's very simple: We have to have the Web,'' said McCaffrey, peering down nearly empty aisles on a recent afternoon.
``I've got 150,000 books here, and I might offend the typical Bostonian by saying this, but there aren't enough people here who read.
That's just how the world is now.''
Battered by chain stores and the on-line giant Amazon.com, one out of every three of New England's independent booksellers has created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open.
To their happy surprise, the reluctant on-line entrepreneurs are finding cyberspace fertile beyond their wildest hopes, as readers in Australia and Japan purchase what locals ignore.
Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation, and not the destruction, of their brick-and-mortar book nooks after all.
At the same time, however, these famously disorganized capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital and the down-to-earth.
Successful Internet ventures have begun to distract owners from the business of selling books to walk-in customers, eroding the character and charm that made independents unique, many proprietors fear.
``We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's the goal.
The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical retailing.''
Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take more and more time to process.
``Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first,'' Gloss said.
``We don't want our in-store customers to feel like they're left out.''
What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web sellers like Barnes Noble's on-line store bn.com.
``But whenever I get the chance, I come to the bookstore.
As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.
Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com, and a few others.
But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as a violation of their store's identity.
In January 1996, only 10 shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had joined them.
Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied association of bookstore proprietors.
``We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,'' said Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, the NEBA's executive director.
``It's a groundswell.''
For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.
``I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get all my books on the Web site,'' said Gloss, whose site holds just a smattering of his collection.
Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the intangible qualities of their shops on-line.
McCaffrey has a page devoted to Blue, for instance.
Gloss offers photos of handsome, leatherbound tomes.
The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison with the real thing.
On ``the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,'' Kramer said.
That has a dimension computer screens cannot accomplish.''
To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock, on-line ordering, and other conveniences.
Most now offer search engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or even to tap into databases of every book in print.
In effect, many tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.
Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to bring in about 125 on-line sales a day.
That converts to roughly 9 percent of total sales on a given day, he said.
``In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has become a necessary convenience,'' Kharbanda said.
And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales, co-owner Helen Kelly said.
The reason, she said, is the plentiful title list on the store's Web site.
Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping experience.
Few independent booksellers take the time to create customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers.
As Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, ``I have no idea how many hits I get.''
Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways.
Anirvan Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line, there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.
But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.
``Book-selling is a great, historic tradition.
Amazon.com is not going to come along and change all that.''
