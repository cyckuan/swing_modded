The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has concluded that the planned merger between the nation's largest bookseller and its largest book wholesaler violates antitrust law and has recommended that the full commission step in to block Barnes Noble's $600 million acquisition of Ingram Book Group, a person involved in the deal said on Monday night.
The decision, a significant victory for both publishers and independent booksellers, which have waged a powerful campaign against the proposed deal since it was announced last year, does not bode well for the planned acquisition.
Lawyers for Barnes Noble and Ingram, a unit of Ingram Industries, will try to make their case soon to the full commission.
But the commissioners rarely overturn the recommendations of their staff.
And if the recommendations are upheld, the two companies will have to decide whether it is worth waging a protracted and uncertain legal fight.
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes Noble, said on Monday night that the company had been working closely with the commission and was providing information that the agency had requested.
``These are confidential proceedings,'' Ms. Keating said, ``and we're not going to comment on speculation.''
Barnes Noble proposed the merger during a period of consolidation and turmoil in the publishing and book-selling industries.
Top executives from the company have hailed the deal as a rare opportunity to recognize great cost-savings through consolidation.
Barnes Noble, in particular, has been in the middle of a buying binge as part of its response to growing competition on line, particularly from Amazon.com.
Amazon.com, which started by relying almost exclusively on wholesalers to fill its orders, remains dependent on the services of Ingram.
Ingram has been its leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its orders, according to Amazon.com.
The acquisition would give Barnes Noble access to 11 distribution centers, which would help it cut costs and reduce delivery time for its growing base of on-line customers.
But from the moment the proposed deal was announced last November, it was denounced by groups representing writers and smaller booksellers.
One group likened it to the marriage of Godzilla and King Kong.
The independent booksellers, led by their trade group, the American Booksellers Association, have waged a fierce legal and letter-writing campaign, hoping to enlist not only the federal regulators, but state antitrust officials as well.
Officials in California said they were investigating the deal.
For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes Noble could ultimately affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular titles that are in short supply.
Although Ingram, which is based in Nashville, is a dominant force in book distribution, it does not disclose its market share.
Barnes Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
The American Booksellers Association, along with Amazon.com, the New York-based Authors Guild, and others had filed papers with the Federal Trade Commission urging it to intervene and block the deal.
But the legal case has hardly been open-and-shut.
While federal regulators have been more rigorously examining proposed mergers during the Clinton administration than in earlier years, they have taken on so-called horizontal ones, that is, those between companies in the same line of business, and have only rarely challenged ``vertical'' mergers involving businesses in different aspects of an industry, like Barnes Noble and Ingram.
Oren Teicher, the chief operating officer of the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he had not heard of the FTC staff's position on the merger but added that the association would be ``extremely gratified'' to see it blocked.
For the nation's bookstores, Teicher said, the merger would be ``terribly anticompetitive.''
Many of the smaller bookstores rely on Ingram as the sole source for books, though the larger stores typically place orders directly through publishers as well as through Ingram and the second-largest wholesaler, Baker Taylor.
Independent booksellers had organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry, with so many petitions, E-mail messages and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency had set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal.
The FTC has been performing what is known as a second request review, a fairly uncommon procedure that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.
Other recent deals in the book industry faced intense reviews from federal regulators but were still eventually approved.
The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon Schuster's education unit, which was ultimately approved.
Bertelsmann A.G.'s successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.
