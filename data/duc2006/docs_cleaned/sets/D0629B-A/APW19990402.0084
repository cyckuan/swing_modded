The close-knit underground of computer virus creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may have been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa.
``The whole community has really been shaken up by this,'' said B.K.
Delong, who follows the virus scene.
``The first group is one that wants a better reputation.
Then there's the community that wants to retaliate and come up with even more destructive viruses.''
Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip.
Most are programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs.
They often write viruses and swap them among themselves, Delong said.
They refer to themselves as ``Black Hats,'' interested in doing damage, and ``White Hats,'' often crack programmers looking for possible security hazards.
The Black Hats sometimes release viruses through e-mail or Usenet newsgroups.
In a statement released on behalf of the VX Underground, as it's often called, the group warned the media and investigators not to quickly condemn the author of Melissa.
``Instead they should be more interested in the person who released the bug which caused the spread of the virus,'' said the statement, which was e-mailed to The Associated Press.
Melissa was originally posted on two sex discussion groups a week ago Friday, according to an online search.
The VX Underground said it was highly unlikely those two posts out of thousands could have led to Melissa's vicious cascade.
``However, once released others posted the Melissa source code to additional newsgroups, Web sites and listservs (mailing lists), which meant anyone could turn it into the virus and continue to spread it,'' the statement continued.
David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and charged with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of companies' e-mail systems.
Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in Microsoft Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known virus writer who calls himself VicodinES.
Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the New Jersey state attorney general's office said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person known by that handle.
Instead, Smith took two viruses, one of which came from VicodinES, and combined them with another virus to create Melissa, she said.
``They (the Black Hat programmers) are looking for someone to blame,'' said Delong.
They resent the treatment VicodinES supposedly received at the hands of the media, and they're rallying around their own.
They said he is a really nice guy.''
