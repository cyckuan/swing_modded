It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins every message you send as an attachment.
You, however, are unware of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail recipients.
Like any virus, it is an executable program, and isn't supposed to work at all unless you execute it.
To the best of my knowledge, I never did that, but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand grenade; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of e-mail, as soon as it was downloaded, it caused the computer to seize up.
Nor could I erase it by any normal means; only Norton AntiVirus was able to get rid of it.
And I had to use a painfully slow Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out.
Eventually, it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there.
So, going into the Norton configuration program, I changed a couple of settings.
Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was ordered to delete the thing on sight.
And instead of examining only .EXE files, it was told to examine everything.
I'm not sure which of these changes did the trick maybe both were required but upon downloading a group of messages which I knew contained the virus somewhere, everything went fine.
No lockup.
Upon examining the messages, the Happy99.exe attachment brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X. I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do something you think it ought to be able to do.
It doesn't always work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer.
It wasn't presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had graphics.
This, however archaic, was apparently the default setting.
If incidentally, you have executed the Happy99 virus, it's not hard to get rid of.
During all the unHappy furor, I installed the latest upgrade to Eudora Pro, the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm.
It's a very worthwhile upgrade.
The program hasn't changed drastically, but lots of things work better.
The main screen is divided into two windows now.
The top window shows a list of your mail, and merely by bringing the cursor to any message, the text appears instantly in the lower window.
No more tiresome double-clicking, and the presentation is much faster.
Additionally, Eudora now makes the mail available in batches.
If you have 200 messages waiting, it gives them to you 20 or so at a time so you don't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download so you can begin reading.
