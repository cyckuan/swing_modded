Computer network of the Romanian presidential office has been out of gear for two days under the attack of a computer virus, the Romanian Press Agency reported Wednesday.
The presidential office did not specify what kind of computer virus disturbed its daily work.
But the press report said that the virus had entered the network through an E-mail message several days ago and broke out on Monday, December 13.
According to local media, it was on December 13 that a vicious macro-virus named Killer C-Disc THUS broke out.
The virus deletes all the documents that are not in use on C-Disc, and paralyzes the entire window system.
