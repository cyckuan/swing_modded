The highly destructive Hare KRSNA computer virus is poised to strike on August 22, said sources obtained here today.
According to South Africa's Computer Virus Helpline Co-ordinator Ian Melamed, Hare KRSNA is at present the most widely reported computer virus in the country and could wipe out all information stored on the hard drives of infected computers on that date.
The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the internet.
The warning also mentioned specifically infected files on the Internet News Groups Alt.Sex.
Technically, the Hare KRSNA Virus is a multi-partite, stealth, slow polymorphic virus which makes it particularly destructive, according to experts.
The helpline is offering a free, 24-hour advisory service countrywide for the detection and removal programme of the virus, the local sources said.
The disk from the helpline would detect and remove more than 9400 other computer viruses.
