Home-made computer viruses are not new in Bangladesh, as the country's first locally-produced virus, the Dhaka Virus, was created in 1991, The Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
The virus, which was created by a local programmer and later renamed T-virus, was not destructive but intended to disturb the MS-Word working environment on the screen.
The virus used to erase the screen for a few seconds and then an instruction box appeared to suggest pressing T to go back to the working environment.
Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected computers of several organizations.
Some young programmers later developed remedial programs to get rid of the virus.
Another local virus, the White Lion, which spread during 1992- 93, was destructive as it erased document files in the MS-Word environment.
The local viruses have faded out of people's mind because of their less-destructive nature and the frequent invasion of international viruses, the report said.
But computer experts feared that more locally-created viruses would affect machines across the country as more students enrolled in computer courses.
"It will soon be a reality in Bangladesh where the local virus creators would reign," computer expert Anko Shohel was quoted as saying.
