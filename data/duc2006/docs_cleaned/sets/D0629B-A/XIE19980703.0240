Spanish computer experts have discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12, the day of the World Cup finals in Paris.
The virus, which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents, will show a flashing banner of "Vive la coupe de monde!"
(Long live the World Cup!)
The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created in France as all of its files were written in French.
