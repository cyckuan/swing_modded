The Philippine government asked the congress Tuesday to pass a law that would impose stiff penalties on cyber crimes following a delay in the arrest of the suspected creators of the "love bug" computer virus.
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora underscored this need in a radio interview as he pointed out that the "Iloveyou" virus, which was allegedly launched in the Philippines, caused much damage not just here but around the world.
Zamora quoted reports as saying the computer virus, which was allegedly created by a Philippine couple using Internet access cards,has caused up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in damage to computer systems in more than 20 countries in Asia, America and Europe.
"It is clear that the virus caused much damage.
We were not affected that much, but the Philippines was used as the base to launch the virus," said Zamora.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has acted swiftly on the case, and with the cooperation of Internet service providers, was able to pinpoint the suspected origin of the virus.
However, the authorities had to dig up a legal basis for the arrest of the suspects and finally came up with the 1988 Access Device Act,which aims to protect consumers from scams involving the use of credit cards or personal identification numbers.
Zamora said it is urgent that the congress comes up with an anti-cyber crime measure to shield the business community from hackers who may attempt to cripple the country's computer systems.
On his part, NBI Director Federico Opinion said it is not clear whether the Philippines will allow foreign governments whose computers were damaged by the virus to pursue civil liabilities against the suspects.
"The crime was committed here.
We have no law for this particular offense.
We have to examine all facts pertaining to the case," he said.
The Philippine couple, Rommel Lamores and Irene de Guzman, who were allegedly responsible for the spread of the virus, have not been charged yet.
The suspects, employees of two separate banks in Manila, were nabbed one after the other in NBI operations Monday.
