One hundred years ago this year, a Smithsonian Institution biologist visited the Pacific Northwest and marveled at the plentifulness of the fish that has come to symbolize the region.
``The quantities of salmon which frequent these waters is beyond calculation,'' said Richard Rathbun, ``and seems to be so great as to challenge human ingenuity to affect it in any way.''
But over the last century, human ingenuity in the form of homebuilding, logging, farming, dam-building, fishing and other activities has managed to significantly affect those very same salmon runs of which Rathbun spoke.
Tuesday, in an attempt to reverse the course of history, the federal government plans to formally announce that nine salmon and steelhead groupings in Washington and Oregon are headed for extinction.
The dwindling salmon runs are throughout the Northwest, from Ozette Lake on the Olympic Peninsula to the Columbia, Snake and Willamette rivers.
By the end of the day Tuesday, virtually every watershed in Washington state will be subject to the strictures of the federal Endangered Species Act, which makes it a crime to harm endangered and threatened species.
And there is more to come.
In June, another federal agency plans to list coastal Puget Sound bull trout another type of salmon for protection.
But much of the focus will be on the wild Puget Sound chinook, prized by fishermen for their large size, but now numbering about one-third of their historic peak.
The chinook spend part of their life cycle in rivers and streams that extend throughout the same part of the Northwest most densely populated by human beings the central Puget Sound counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish, home to 3 million people.
The listing of four groups of chinook as threatened meaning they are at risk of becoming endangered will post a major test of just how far this country is willing to go in protecting endangered species.
There are currently 702 species of plants and 477 species of animals listed for protection under the 26-year-old Endangered Species Act.
But most of those species live in sparsely populated rural areas.
Never before has the government demanded protection of a species whose habitat so completely suffuses one of the nation's large metropolitan areas.
By declaring the species eligible for protection under the federal Endangered Species Act, the government will be calling for changes in a wide variety of practices by farmers, fishermen, builders, businesses and homeowners.
These groups are thought to be harming the salmon either directly, by catching them or blocking their passage, or indirectly, by polluting or altering the waters the fish call home.
``We've got problems with water quality and water quantity in many parts of the state, habitat destruction from agriculture and timber and development, hydropower and harvest and hatchery impacts,'' says Curt Smitch, salmon adviser to Gov.
