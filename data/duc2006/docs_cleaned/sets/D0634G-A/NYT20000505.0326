For roughly half of the millions of salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and often lethal one.
They can be whacked to death by giant blades of the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get to take the boat.
But this annual free ride, by which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before.
And for scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a momentous decision that will ultimately fall to Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive critics say outlandish accommodation to man's demands for electricity.
Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a pipe that runs into a trailer downstream of this dam, the first of the four, which is near the Idaho border.
In the trailer, a busy assembly line of seasonal workers briefly anesthetizes the salmon and then injects a computer chip the size of a rice grain into their bellies so they can be tracked over the years.
They are barged for a 36-hour, 300-mile trip, bypassing the dams on the Snake and four more on the Columbia River.
More salmon are collected at two other dams on the Snake and one on the Columbia.
It is all part of the government's bid to keep both salmon and dams ``to find a way to have our cake and eat it, too,'' said Jim Anderson, a fisheries professor at the University of Washington.
But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs.
The Corps of Engineers is to recommend by the end of the year whether to propose such a step.
Breaching of the dams is bitterly opposed by many people as an assault on the area's agricultural economy, and the proposal has already emerged as a hot-button issue in the Northwest in this year's presidential race.
