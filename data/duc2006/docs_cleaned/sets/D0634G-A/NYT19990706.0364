Headlines report a $400 million effort to save salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
Others announce that the United States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.
Still others tell readers there are other threats to Pacific Northwest salmon, such as Caspian terns feasting on young salmon in Washington rivers.
Now, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says consumers are confused about whether it is OK for them to eat salmon because they fear threatening and endangering the fish.
Alaska salmon is different, they say, and they have begun a $250,000 public relations campaign to carry their message to consumers.
An in-depth research project conducted for the institute indicates that consciencous Americans including many in the Pacific Northwest don't know Alaska salmon isn't threatened or endangered, said Barbara Belknap, the institute's executive director.
``How ironic it would be if Americans quit eating all-natural salmon, thinking it was endangered as has happened with tuna and swordfish when last year 150 million Alaska salmon were harvested and 100 million more made it upstream to spawn,'' she said.
``It's important to us that people understand we're sensitive to the fisheries problems in the Pacific Northwest and we don't want to come off as saying we got salmon and you don't.
We are aware and concerned.''
Researchers who conducted interviews in Seattle, New York, Atlanta and Chicago found that people, especially in Seattle, were aware of the threats to salmon runs.
But they were lumping Alaska salmon with problems in Oregon and Washington fisheries, she said.
``People in Seattle especially are very sophisticated salmon buyers and they would go into the supermarket and see the case filled with salmon but they were concerned,'' Belknap said.
``We wanted to conduct an education campaign before it began to affect sales.
We wanted to be pro-active.''
Among information distributed by the institute are these items: No salmon stock of Alaska origin is threatened or endangered.
Alaska has only three dams in the entire state and more than 15,000 salmon streams.
Alaska's seafood industry, much of it operated by owners of small boats, is the state's largest private employer.
Scott Marshall, a fisheries biologist and regional supervisor at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said Alaska has had ``nearly 15 years of record commercial salmon catches and last year it declined a bit back down to a normal level.''
Alaska has programs assuring salmon management and escapement and balancing the catch against the escapement, he said.
Alaska's salmon rivers are pristine and free of dams, he said.
Fresh and ocean waters offer excellent habitat for salmon, and Alaska, with a statewide population of about 600,000, is thousands of miles away from large sources of pollution.
