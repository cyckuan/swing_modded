Sea walls, bulkheads and other man-made barriers have transformed more than half of the central Puget Sound coastline, starving beaches of sand and salmon of food and shelter.
State and federal officials are moving to protect these areas, but they are running into resistance from landowners and local agencies, turning shorelines into a new environmental battlefield.
There is nothing new about the problem.
Homeowners and industries have built walls against waterfront erosion for decades.
Few people noticed.
Until recently, few cared.
But a recent survey found that man has reshaped an extraordinary 52 percent of the central Puget Sound coastline.
The damage has gradually accumulated, scientists say.
In many places, sandy beaches have eroded away to cobble or hardpan, wiping out spawning areas for small fish and beds for grasses that nurture marine life.
Part of what makes the problem difficult to attack, biologists say, is that any single wall does little harm.
``It is the proverbial death by a thousand cuts,'' said Dan Pentilla, a biologist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
``If bulkheading isn't controlled or new material added, the beaches on Puget Sound are going to coarsen and disappear.''
To scientists, beaches aren't the stable features that appear to the casual beach-walker.
They are rivers of sand.
They ebb and flow at the prodding of waves, currents and tides.
Bulkheads and seawalls are retaining walls built a short distance from shore to slow natural erosion of banks into water by reducing wave action on the beach.
In doing so, bulkheads can dam the headwaters of these granular streams, with effects that can stretch for miles.
By reflecting wave energy, they also can accelerate how fast sand is washed away.
This week, protection of beaches was elevated by the long-heralded listing of Puget Sound chinook salmon as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
The local chinook is one of several fish that suffer from shoreline armoring.
Federal officials are writing rules that will prohibit people from doing anything that significantly harms the fish or its habitat unless specifically exempted.
That means tighter restrictions loom over bulkhead-building.
In an effort to protect near-shore habitat, and maybe avoid draconian restrictions, a state commission on shoreline guidelines proposes to make bulkhead-building a last resort.
The panel, representing government agencies and business, environmental and recreational groups, aims to make homeowners prove that proposed bulkheads are needed to protect their homes from imminent danger, and that a ``softer'' solution, such as adding gravel to the beach or planting on a bluff, will not work.
But the proposal faces an uncertain future.
Society's interest in saving fish and beaches collides at the shoreline with homeowners' determination to safeguard even small pieces of waterfront land.
Bulkheads are buttressed by forces of economics and property rights almost as irresistible as Puget Sound's tides.
The real estate market rewards their construction by boosting the value of land that is protected.
And when conflicts with regulators have arisen, courts and the Legislature have generally backed landowners' wall-building.
It remains to be seen whether the Endangered Species Act, once termed the hydrogen bomb of environmental laws, will shift the balance toward conservation.
There is little doubt that coarsening beaches by reducing them to hardpan and gravel affects salmon.
When small fish like sand lance and surf smelt lose spawning areas, their decline deprives young salmon of food.
Sand loss also can eliminate footing for eelgrass, which provides both food and shelter for to salmon in what is, for some, a crucial stage of development.
Probably the most heavily affected salmon are so-called ``ocean-type'' chinook, which leave streams early to spend as long as two months in shallow Puget Sound waters, according to Charles Simenstad of the University of Washington School of Fisheries.
There, in a process he calls ``puberty times 10,'' they adjust to saltwater and pack on the size and strength they need to evade predators at sea.
Other types of salmon do not use the shallows as much, so why not write off the ocean-type chinook?
Biologists say the region's depleted chinook family cannot afford to lose an important branch.
Salmon rely on diverse life cycles to avoid extinction, somewhat as investors rely on diverse stock portfolios to reduce risk of financial collapse.
Chinook salmon are the masters of diversity, with some racing to sea, others lingering in streams and still more hanging around Puget Sound.
The payoff in the evolutionary lottery is clear: If conditions for one type of chinook collapse, others can carry on the species.
That calculation has focused official attention on Puget Sound beaches and near-shore shallows.
Most of the region's attention has focused on streams, so some officials are warning that degrading near-shore areas risk becoming ``the neglected link'' for salmon between rivers and the sea.
``If we focus solely on the streams and don't focus on the near-shore, we aren't going to be successful'' restoring Puget Sound chinook, says Chuck Clarke, regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
State officials hope to upgrade habitat protection by rewriting state shoreline guidelines, which prod counties to meet minimum standards for protection.
Biologists say the 20-year-old guidelines are badly outdated.
But some businesses and property owners are resisting change.
Three attempts to upgrade guidelines have run aground, and dissent continues.
The Association of Washington Business boycotted the current guidelines commission and calls its recommendation premature.
Thomas Terich, a professor of geography at Western Washington University in Bellingham, empathizes with the opponents.
``It's a difficult situation,'' he says.
In fact, no one expects to tear out bulkheads, so the guidelines will have little impact on the well-hardened shores of urban areas like Seattle and Tacoma.
Mostly, the commission hopes new rules will slow the spread of walls across still-developing shorelines, such as those of rural Pierce and Kitsap counties.
The front-line troops defending these shorelines are habitat biologists for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
They issue permits for docks and bulkheads.
Still, their authority is limited.
The Legislature has directed them to expedite permits for bulkheads in front of single family homes.
While biologists may encourage less-damaging bulkhead designs, they say they generally lack authority to deny them.
City and county development agencies exercise the most control over bulkhead and retaining-wall construction.
Wall-builders must get permits from these agencies whether the project is above or below high water.
County attitudes about shoreline protection vary widely.
Whatcom and Thurston counties have cracked down on building bulkheads and retaining walls.
``We don't think they're necessary and they're somewhat destructive to the environment,'' said Roger Giebelhaus, an environmental planner in Thurston County's development office.
Some other counties and cities have shrugged off biologists' attempts to slow bulkhead-building.
Ordinances in many places ``are not strong enough to prevent damage to near-shore habitat,'' says state researcher Ginny Broadhurst.
Jim Brennan, a state habitat biologist, goes further.
In Kitsap County, he complained, ``we're allowing people to build anywhere they want with no analysis.''
Even in King County, generally one of the most progressive in enforcing environmental laws, shoreline administrators have butted heads with state biologists.
The county's Department of Development and Environmental Services routinely waives environmental review for homeowner proposals to build replacement bulkheads and docks, which can shade out eelgrass and harbor fish that prey on salmon.
In the past year, state biologists objected, noting that the replacements often went far beyond the original structure.
One 40-foot dock, for instance, was ``replaced'' by an 80-foot dock without environmental review.
Mark Carey, director of land use for the county department, said he was ``infuriated'' by the second-guessing from the state, which he rejected.
Even though King County ordered all agencies to re-examine procedures that could affect salmon, Carey's agency stuck by its practice.
State habitat biologist John Boettner says he once mentioned to county officials that chinook would soon be listed as threatened, but got brushed off.
``They said it wasn't listed yet,'' Boettner said.
But as the county felt the hot breath of this week's listing, it called for all county agencies, including Carey's, to impose tighter environmental reviews.
