Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
The major requirement is that the dams be operated with no net loss of salmon.
It is the product of four years of negotiations involving dam-owning utilities, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Indian tribes and a key conservation group.
The plan mandates that 91 percent of the young salmon migrating downstream survive through each dam and reservoir.
The Chelan and Douglas County Public Utility Districts, the operators of the dams, will make up for any salmon mortality by production at hatcheries, and by an ambitious program of enhancing salmon habitat in river systems draining the east slope of the Cascades.
``The key is that the plan sets standards, and the federal government leaves it to the utilities to figure out how to achieve these goals.
They know what can work best at each dam,'' said Terry Garcia, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and the atmosphere.
The habitat plan covers Rock Island, Rocky Reach and Wells dams.
The dams are owned by the two Central Washington utilities, but supply electricity to Puget Sound Energy.
``There isn't a single federally owned dam in the Columbia River system that is meeting these performance standards.
This is going to be a model,'' said Lorraine Bodi of American Rivers, a conservation group that worked on the plan.
With freedom to tailor fish protection to their dams, Chelan and Douglas PUD managers have tried out ideas large and small as can be seen at Rocky Reach Dam north of Wenatchee.
The reservoir above the dam has pipes and diverters for a $12.9 million, prototype fish collector.
If it works, a $50 million permanent collector will be installed to attract young salmon and send them around the dam.
Inside the dam's powerhouse, turbines are being redesigned to eliminate an indentation that was pinching and cutting into young salmon.
Below the dam, nearly invisible stainless steel wires are strung across the river.
The cables keep away the fish-eating seagulls that usually flock to the turbulent waters below dams on the Columbia River.
Government employees also use starter pistols and bottle rockets to drive away predator birds.
``Of the salmon that go through our turbines, 5 percent are killed.
The other 95 come out stunned and disoriented.
What we are trying to do is remove predators while fish get their bearings,'' said Dick Nason, executive director of corporate services at the Chelan County PUD.
The Chelan PUD discovered that thousands of young salmon were passing alive through Rocky Reach, but disappearing in a 300-yard stretch between the dam and two trees along the west bank.
They were providing a feast for squawfish.
``The first thing we did was go out and hire eight college and high school kids at $7.50 an hour,'' said Nason.
``They fished for eight weeks and pulled 10,000 squawfish out of the river.''
The utility has since financed Rotary Club fish derbies, and prevailed on the Agriculture Department to include squawfish in a predator-control program.
Keeping the predators away is vital, as can be seen elsewhere on the Columbia River.
Birds and predator fish below Bonneville Dam have devoured more than 20 percent of the young salmon emerging from the outfall of the dam's second powerhouse.
South of Wenatchee, at Rock Island Dam, most young salmon go safely down the dam's spillways.
Built in 1933, Rock Island was the first major dam on the main Columbia River, and is only half as high as its upstream neighbor Rocky Reach.
While the conservation plan governs dams in Central Washington, it has wide-ranging implications around the Northwest.
They include: Assured power: A big chunk of the electricity from the projects is transmitted across the mountains.
All species: The plan governs all species of salmon and steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
``The no-net-loss policy applies to spring, summer and fall chinook, sockeye salmon, steelhead and coho salmon if the tribes successfully re-introduce this species,'' said Bill Dobbins, manager of the Douglas County PUD.
``If the players can get together, write their own plan, and set in place a degree of certainty while assuring survival of the salmon, everybody can emerge as a winner,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
The agreement on the Columbia River ``represents the future of the Endangered Species Act; this is how to achieve recovery with flexibility,'' Garcia said.
Each dam on the Columbia River has its own design and hydrology.
Some are more easily modified than others.
Wells, the newest of the utilities' dams, has a unique structure in which the power plant is located in the middle of the dam.
The spillways are on top of the turbines.
By accident of design, it has become most fish-friendly dam on the Columbia.
The utility has installed a vertical slot in the middle of the dam.
It takes most salmon through the dam, underneath the spillway, and deposits them downstream.
``Overall we figure we have a mortality rate of just 1.2 percent of the salmon that pass through our project,'' said Robert Clubb, the Douglas PUD's chief of environmental and regulatory services.
The enthusiasm and ingenuity of the two utilities has impressed Bodi of American Rivers.
As a senior federal fisheries attorney, she crossed swords with the Chelan PUD in the mid-1980s over the relicensing of Rock Island Dam.
But after losing a legal battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, the utility began to consult its critics.
``They made a decision early on to work with tribes and conservation agencies,'' Bodi said.
The habitat plan is to be signed June 27.
Supporters hope for the broadest possible support, with Indian tribes and American Rivers signing along with federal agencies and the two public utility districts.
But prospects for that are clouded.
The Yakama, Colville and Umatilla Indians helped negotiate the agreement.
But they are locked in a dispute with the National Marine Fisheries Service over harvesting standards and hatchery enhancement of endangered fish stocks.
``The assumption is that this will be worked out before the signing,'' Bodi said.
``I'm not so sure.
If the tribes feel they can't sign the plan, I won't sign it.''
The Grant County PUD, which owns Wanapum and Priest Rapids dams on the mid-Columbia River, has backed away from the habitat plan.
``Chelan and Douglas are signing a plan that our engineering people have advised us is virtually impossible for us to meet,'' said Don Godard, manager of the Grant PUD.
Instead of a sweeping agreement, Godard said, the utility will do ``a step-by-step process'' with federal fisheries managers and Indian tribes.
``The difference is that Chelan and Douglas have agreed to a process, which leaves them free to decide how to meet standards,'' he added.
``In our case, we will be working with the tribes and agencies to reach agreement on specific actions.''
