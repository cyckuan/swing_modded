The Canadian government today called on the United States to "return in good faith to negotiations" aimed at solving the Pacific salmon dispute.
Canada suspended talks on May 21 when the U.S. negotiator was unable to advance a position on one of the key southern issues, Fraser River sockeye.
He emphasized that "barring an immediate return to negotiations, we will consider further options.
"On May 21, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans stepped up enforcement of measures requiring foreign vessels to contact Canadian authorities as they pass through Canadian waters," said Fisheries and Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin.
The Canadian Minister added that his country will assess the impact of these measures in the near future to determine their effectiveness.
Under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations, vessels that violated the regulations can be inspected, required to go to a Canadian port or face arrest, depending on circumstances.
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed, and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
Canadian officials say Canada has honored its treaty obligations to take a limited share of West Coast commercial salmon stocks.
But the U.S. Alaskan catch, the officials say, has been continuously excessive and has reached a 500-million U.S. dollars imbalance in favor of the United States since 1985.
