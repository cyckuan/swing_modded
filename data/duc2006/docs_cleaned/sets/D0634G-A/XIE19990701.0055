The United States and Canada signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
The Treaty was signed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering and Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chtien at the U.S. State Department's Treaty Room.
The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border scientific cooperation.
It calls for the U.S. to spend 140 million U.S. dollars to restore salmon habitat and other measures to rebuild stocks.
The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act.
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
