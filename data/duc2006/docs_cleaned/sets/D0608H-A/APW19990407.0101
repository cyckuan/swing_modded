Cars should be designed with child safety first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children ride, the head of a federal safety agency says.
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, is taking that message to automakers in New York for the annual auto show there.
``Despite overwhelming statistics indicating the need for better protection for children, child passenger safety has been an afterthought when it comes to designing cars.
That needs to change,'' Hall said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at the World Traffic Safety Symposium, an event being held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show.
``It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle design,'' Hall said.
``We need look no further than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not doing so.''
Air bags inflating in minor crashes have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children.
Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries.
The back seat is now empty in those crash tests.
When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997.
Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children older than age 5.
This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes.
Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks, including the rear center seat where they are often missing.
Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests rather than rise up at their necks.
Most autos have adjustable shoulder belts only in the front seats.
Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.
In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes.
Government statistics indicate more than 80 percent of child seats are installed incorrectly.
