Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan, the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
Due in dealer showrooms as early as mid-September, this new front-drive, full-size sedan will a) alienate some Volvo diehards who think boxy is just the thing, and b) draw a whole lot of new buyers into the Volvo fold, people who just couldn't bear to buy the type of car associated with middle-age mothers.
The S80, with a price range of $40,000 to $43,000, will be the most expensive production Volvo ever.
But anyone who drives the vehicle will immediately put it in the same class as European luxury cars such as the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class and the Audi A6.
Volvo has gone upscale with this car, and you can bet it will be a force in the marketplace even against such heady competition.
Why?
That's easy.
Take Volvo's long-standing reputation for safety, quality and longevity, add a full measure of luxury, and you've got a package that the consumer in the $40,000-sedan class has been yearning for.
Safety, which has always been Volvo's primary focus, takes no back seat in the new S80.
This car is, without a doubt, the safest Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and the ``inflatable curtain,'' Volvo's version of the side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the event of a T-bone collision.
Although Volvo will offer the S80 with seven different engines, including two inline six-cylinders and five five-cylinders, only the six-cylinders will be sold in the United States.
The top-of-the-line engine will be the T6, a 2.8-liter, inline six-cylinder with double turbochargers, rated at a whopping 272 horsepower.
This engine's power is on par with that of 4-liter V-8s in competitive makes and Volvo will also sell the vehicle with a five-speed manual transmission.
General Motors four-speed automatic is standard for Volvos with six-cylinder engines, and will be the one most buyers choose.
It is so smooth-shifting that it's virtually seamless.
The second engine destined for the U.S. market will be a normally aspirated (non-turbo) 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder rated at 204 horsepower.
This engine is expected to be the biggest seller; from my experience, this has all the power most buyers will ever need.
Passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost as much as the driver enjoys driving it.
It's smooth and cushy but with enough road feel left to give the driver some fun on curves and turns.
The rear seat is roomy enough for three adults to ride comfortably, even on long trips, and the front bucket seats are so comfy you may want to order a couple for your living room.
The S80's distinct, modern design copies no other vehicle, yet it looks as contemporary as any of its competition from Europe or Japan.
The design is the product of Volvo's California studio, led by U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
Production of the S80 is under way at Volvo's plant in Gothenburg, Sweden.
The official on-sale date is Oct. 12, but dealers are taking orders, Volvo officials said.
This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future the company's first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the traditional Volvo safety and durability that about 25,000 dealers and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North America.
Ford plans to introduce an all-new compact sport-utility vehicle for model year 2001 that will compete against the Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V.
Smaller than the midsize Explorer, the new model will be built in Claycomo, Mo., where Ford makes Contour and Mercury Mystique compact sedans.
Production of those slow-selling vehicles if they are still on the market by then will be transferred to Mexico, the company says.
Ford's Japanese partner Mazda will sell its own version of the new sport-utility, the first SUV model shared with Ford since the Mazda Navajo, a two-door version of the Explorer, was discontinued three years ago.
