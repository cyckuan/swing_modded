After praising DaimlerChrysler and General Motors for their child seat safety programs, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board criticized six other automakers for not doing enough.
Chairman Jim Hall, in a speech Monday at a national highway safety meeting in Atlanta, scolded Volvo, Mitsubishi, Kia, Subaru, Suzuki and Isuzu.
Hall said the six companies have refused to set up ''fitting stations,'' where parents can get expert advice on how to install child safety seats.
Government studies have shown that eight of 10 safety seats are installed incorrectly.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Transportation officials say properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half.
The more common mistakes include using the wrong size seat and using a forward-facing seat for an infant who's not old enough to ride in one.
Volvo spokesman Soren Johansson said he wasn't sure the NTSB had even approached his company about a child-safety program, but he praised the focus of the meeting in Atlanta.
''Child safety has been on the agenda with us for years,'' Johansson said.
''It's good to see other manufacturers are now jumping on the bandwagon.''
Subaru spokesman Richard Marshall said his company sent a letter to the NTSB saying it would like to cooperate in a child seat safety program if guidelines could be worked out.
Mitsubishi spokesman Kim Custer said his company has done a series of campaigns about child passenger safety.
Representatives of the three other companies singled out by Hall did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday.
Hall praised a DaimlerChrysler program launched last month that allows adults driving any make of vehicle to make appointments at DaimlerChrysler dealerships to see if their child seat is properly installed.
He also praised General Motors, which has had a long-standing partnership with the National Safe Kids Campaign to hold car seat checkups.
''This is a viable first step taken by two of our major auto manufacturers to change the safety culture on our highways and to put the focus on our kids,'' Hall said.
He said Ford Motor Co. officials told him Sunday that they plan to announce a major car-seat program soon.
Hall said BMW, Honda, Nissan and Saab are still deciding what sort of commitment they will make.
Toyota and Volkswagen have said they will encourage dealers to set up fitting stations, but they haven't committed any money to the effort, Hall said.
Hall also called on states to strengthen and enforce child passenger protection laws.
He said children should be in child restraints up to age 4, in booster seats to age 8 and in the back seat at all times.
''However, not one state currently has a comprehensive child passenger protection law with all of these requirements,'' Hall said.
''There must be zero tolerance for unbuckled children.''
Car crash fatalities for children ages 5-9 increased by 23 percent from 1982 to 1998.
In the same time period, fatalities for children up to 4 years old decreased by 8 percent.
