Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags turned on.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children in child seats near air bags.
Safety experts recommend that small infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of an air bag.
At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since 1994, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and turn off the passenger air bag.
But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the passenger airbag might not turn off as designed.
Drivers would know the system was not working only because an ``airbag off'' light would stay dark.
Mercedes-Benz said there have been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports of accidents or injuries.
The company recommended the seats not be used and that children sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed.
Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships.
Mercedes dealers will exchange the seats for free.
The recall does not affect Toddler seats.
