The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
``The NTSB believes that the federal and state governments should be more directly involved in assuring that child safety seats are used correctly,'' said Jim Hall, the chairman of the safety agency.
Most parents do not know a child seat is improperly installed until after their child is killed or injured in a crash, Hall said.
Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly.
If all children using child seats were restrained properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency estimated.
Frustrated parents struggle to properly install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of different types of cars each year, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' Hall said.
Properly used child seats reduce the risk of fatal injuries by more than 50 percent, he said.
The fitting stations could be established across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations or automobile dealerships, Hall said.
He said the initiative should be funded out of government transportation dollars but had no cost estimate.
The board can only recommend auto safety initiatives, but its recommendations carry great weight within the federal government.
Hall also reiterated other NTSB initiatives as part of a package the board believes would reduce child deaths and injuries in traffic accidents.
Built-in child seats should be available in more cars and trucks.
Hall believed they should be used on airplanes and school buses as well.
All states should adopt laws that allow police to pull autos over when passengers are not wearing seat belts.
Seat belt surveys have shown when a driver is buckled, restraint use for children is 94 percent.
When a driver is unbuckled, restraint use for children is 30 percent.
Children 12 and under should ride in the back seat.
Children ages 4 to 8 should be properly secured in booster seats because they are not old enough to fit adult seat belts.
Child safety groups said permanent checkpoints would send a strong message about the importance of proper child seat installation.
``If we can do this, it will reduce the mortality of children (in car crashes) by at least 25 percent to 35 percent nationwide,'' said Martin Eichelberger, a surgeon at Children's National Medical Center and president of the National Safe Kids Campaign.
The NHTSA is set to announce early this year a federal requirement that all new child safety seats must have the same, simple anchoring system in new cars.
The average car is about 9 years old, however, underscoring the need for child seat fitting stations for the millions of vehicles already on the road, Hall said.
