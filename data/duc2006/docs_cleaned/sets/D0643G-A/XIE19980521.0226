China's National Research Center for Marine Environmental Forecasts said today that next El Nino will occur around 2002.
According to the center's Dr. Wang Zhanggui, El Nino is related to sunspot activity, and generally occurs four to five years after a period of little sunspot activity, which was the case last year, when there was strong El Nino activity.
Song Xuejia, the center's deputy director, says that no other scientists have made such a "bold prediction" before.
They reached their conclusion after having studied a large amount of materials on unspots and El Nino for the last 250 years.
"No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity increases," Wang said.
Sunspot activity is expected to increase this year and will reach its apex in 2000, according to the Royal Observatory of Belgium.
Sunspot activity will decrease again in 2006 and complete another cycle.
Wang predicts that two to three El Ninos will occur in the first seven years of the next century.
Wang and his colleagues found the links between sunspot activity and El Nino through satellite photos, and say that sunspot activity can affect ocean temperatures and cloud, which give rise to El Nino.
