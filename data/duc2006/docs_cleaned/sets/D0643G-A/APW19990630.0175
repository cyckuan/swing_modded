The weather-altering La Nina phenomenon has all but vanished from the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA satellite observations.
The pool of unusually cool tropical water marked by low sea levels has shriveled and the equatorial Pacific is warming to normal temperatures, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this week.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
La Nina has shrunk several times and then had a resurgence over the past 12 months, they said.
For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South.
La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America, and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.
