Australian scientists have uncovered a link between global warming and the increasing frequency of the El Nino weather system, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported tonight.
The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a result of global warming.
Steve Wilson, a scientist of the climate modeling program at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia's top national scientific research body, explained that a sophisticated computer model set up at the CSIRO laboratories showed a relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies and the warm El Nino phase.
When the present levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide were doubled in the experiment, the number of El Ninos affecting Australia nearly doubled too, the scientist said.
Barry Hunt, leader of the research project, told the program he wanted more time to verify the model's findings.
"We'd like to do a more elaborate and longer experiment but as far as I know, we are the only group who actually found the change in the frequency of El Nino events," Hunt said.
The program said experiments on the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian claims.
"It appears that we have a very good case for suggesting that the El Ninos are going to become more frequent ... and more intense and, in a few years or a decade, so we'll go into a permanent El Nino," Mauna Loa Director Russell Schneider told the program.
Hunt said climate warming's affect on El Nino was complex, even showing that a gradual increase in carbon dioxide output would make the Australian continent drier, while, if the output were doubled, the effect would actually make Australia wetter.
The model's scenario showed Australia getting drier for about 100 years at which time it would become wetter than it currently is.
The United Nations Climate Convention will be held in Japan next month and Australia has argued against binding uniform targets, preferring the concept of differentiation which would consider the varying economic circumstances of developed countries.
