Bangladesh is studying the effects of El Nino in order to develop a model to help farmers understand the global weather pattern when the ocean current in the Pacific coast off Peru warms up or cools down, a press report said Monday.
Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon, which is responsible for rains or drought world-wide, to help the country's farmers cope with its effects, SPARRSO director Dr.
Chowdhury told a recent function at the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic Studies.
Farmers needed help to chart their crop calendar to keep themselves updated with the changing mood of nature to better cope with it, and vary the sowing and planting periods, he said, adding that the model would be prepared by the SPARRSO and the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council.
"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance of El Nino," the weather expert said.
Since El Nino went 'retreating' in May, it has begun casting its eye on Bangladesh for the past few days, bringing much needed rains, he noted, adding that the reverse was likely to trigger rainfall and flooding.
On the past effects of El Nino, he said that after it occurred in 1972-73, El Nino reversed to trigger floods in 1974, in 1982-83 it reversed into a spate of flooding, and again in 1986, El Nino led to the worst flooding when it reversed in 1987 and 1988 respectively, he said.
The phenomenon had been responsible for only 40 percent rainfall in the country in June, he said.
"Not only we had 60 percent less rainfall in June, but it also delayed the arrival of Monsoon by a month," he added.
