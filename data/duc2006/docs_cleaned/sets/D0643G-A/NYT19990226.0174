La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to government forecasters.
La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific.
It ended the record El Nino event last May but has been just as disruptive as its brother, scientists say.
It is blamed for flooding and heavy snow in the West, abnormally warm weather in the East and extreme weather from South America to Asia.
``This La Nina provides the physical link between many of the unusual weather patterns seen in far-flung parts of the globe,'' said John Janowiak, a scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
``While parts of Alaska have experienced severe cold, most of the lower 48 states, especially those in the southern tier, have enjoyed record-breaking warm temperatures.''
Already, the still-strengthening La Nina pattern has built the Sierra Nevada's snowpack to record highs and sent Alaskan temperatures to record lows.
And, forecasters say, still more snow in the next two or three months will stack up on top of a snowpack that already measures 478 inches at the Kirkwood ski resort in Alpine County, Calif.
The snowpack is about twice normal in many areas and as high as last year's record El Nino year in most cases.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns.
Even with its nearly 40 feet of snow, Kirkwood is only the second snowiest site in North America.
Mount Baker in Washington state has received a couple of feet more.
The National Weather Service also predicts colder-than-normal temperatures on the West Coast through May, when La Nina may still be in force.
The colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures have grown into one of the strongest La Nina episodes in 50 years, according to scientists at the weather service's climate prediction center in Camp Springs, Md.
Temperatures in the lower 48 have been warmer than normal, with many states reporting among their warmest November-January periods ever.
The United States as a whole had its third-warmest November-January period of the past 104 years.
On La Nina's downside, huge storms with hurricane-force winds blasted Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and there has been flooding in some northern states.
At the same time, wide areas of the Southwest are experiencing drought.
La Nina's impacts include heavy rains, severe storms and flooding in southern Africa, drought in Kenya and Tanzania, flooding in the Philippines and Indonesia and abnormal wetness in northern South America.
The extreme weather is just the opposite of the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.
