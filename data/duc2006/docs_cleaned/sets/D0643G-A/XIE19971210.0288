space agency NASA said that the warm Pacific water current known as El Nino has become weaker, shrinking by at least 10 percent and falling to the level last observed in early September, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory came the conclusion after analyzing the data collected from satellite last week.
Climate experts said this year's El Nino was one of the century's largest and most disruptive weather phenomena.
However the latest data on El Nino from a NASA satellite made them conclude that El Nino has completed its second peak.
Over the next several weeks, the El Nino current could peter out, or it may simply be pausing before gathering greater force, they said.
