"The mass media or one organization does not represent the American people, either.
We feel the reports or TV's news make an unfair impression," they said.
John and Elaine Carrillo from Arizona, who are in the last stage of our adoption process, voiced their similar viewpoints.
Ken and Brenda Barker, who have adopted a child in 1992 from Changsha City in central China's Hunan Province, said "our experience was very different than that of the recent newspaper articles, and we visited the orphanage as well."
"Our daughter, Joy, is the greatest gift that we could have ever asked for.
Everyone who meets here absolutely adores her.
She is full of 'joy'," they said.
"We would love to adopt again, it was such a wonderful experience.
We also loved the people, culture, and land of China," they added.
"It should be noted, however, that over the last four-five years the Chinese government has developed a very successful international adoption program, allowing about 5,000 children to be adopted abroad," it added.
"It has been the observation of almost all of the thousands of adopting parents that have visited dozens of different orphanages that the care provided for their children was as good as possible, given resource constraints."
"The orphanage staffs are faced with the daily challenge of providing care to growing numbers of children with limited basic resources, such as formula, clothing and medical supplies," the statement said.
The statement went on to say that "in general, we commend the Chinese government for their efforts to improve the outcome of institutionalization for a growing number of children through their program of foreign adoption."
