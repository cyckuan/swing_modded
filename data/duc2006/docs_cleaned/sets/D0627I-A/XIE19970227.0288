The Canadian government today announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
The convention, which was finalized on May 29, 1993, and came into force on May 1, 1995, seeks to establish safeguards so that international adoptions are carried out in the best interests of the children.
It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000 intercountry adoptions around the world every year, of which 2,000 involve Canadians.
"The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to harmonize the practices of different countries.
This cooperation will help promote the rights of children in the world," said Canadian Secretary of State Christine Stewart, who made the announcement today.
In Canada, adoption falls within the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories, which must pass legislation to apply the convention.
To date, five provinces have passed implementing legislation.
They are British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.
The convention will come into force in these provinces on April 1, 1997.
The ratification of the convention has also made it necessary to amend the federal immigration regulations.
The amendments should come into force on April 1, 1997, Stewart said.
Sixty-six states participated in the drafting of the convention, which has been already ratified by 13 countries, including Canada.
