He said the purposed relaxing restrictions on domestic adoptions are to provide more orphans with access to family warmth and ensure healthy growth.
The existing law on adoption placed excessive restrictions on people who are fully capable and willing to adopt children, and prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and handicapped minors, according to Doje.
"Welfare institutions are less than ideal places to promote the healthy growth of unfortunate children because of poor living conditions and the lack of family warm," said the minister.
The existing law stipulates that people seeking to adopt must be childless, and can only adopt one orphaned or handicapped child.
The new draft excludes the limitation that requires people to be childless or to adopt only one child.
The draft also lowers the minimum age required for adopting people from 35 to 30, and removes restrictions on people unable to bear a child.
It also permits some people to adopt children over the age of 14.
The draft stipulates that all domestic adoptions be registered with the government, and notes relationships take effect upon registration and are protected by law.
