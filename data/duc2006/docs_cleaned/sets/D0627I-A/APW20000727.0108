Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday.
The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
The bill would give various federal agencies the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.
The United States signed the measure in 1994.
Senate aides say lawmakers expect the House to ''move swiftly'' in final passage of the implementing language.
Once that is completed, the Senate will consider ratification of the treaty, although lawmakers have given no indication when that may happen.
Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud.
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the legislation ''is intended to bring some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United States.''
The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys released a statement saying the measure ''holds tremendous potential to correct some significantly flawed international adoption practices.''
In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally.
