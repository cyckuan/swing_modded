Guatemala's attorney general said Thursday that he wants to suspend all adoptions by foreigners after complaints that unscrupulous lawyers were taking advantage of poor women.
Attorney General Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate and the Supreme Court to suspend foreign adoptions of Guatemalan children while new regulations are drafted to better regulated the process.
Human rights groups have denounced what they say is the widespread practice of lawyers coercing women into giving up their babies so they can collect a high adoption fee, usually about dlrs 15,000.
Ricardo Alvarado, president of the Guatemalan Lawyers Association, said his group doesn't oppose the suspension of foreign adoptions, adding that only a small group of bad lawyers are to blame for the abuses.
In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all involving foreigners.
This year, the U.S. Embassy expects 1,000 children to be adopted by U.S. citizens alone.
