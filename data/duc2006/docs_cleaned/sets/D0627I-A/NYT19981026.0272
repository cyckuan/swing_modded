``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,'' said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio, family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and Jenna.
Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one.
``Some people make comments, like `You act like you're white.'
And I say, `That's really dumb.
You can't act like a color.'''
``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies, in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant would be eight years but much less for a child from another country, or of another race.
``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and told us about Nikki,'' said Ms. Golden, 40.
Race was never an issue for us.
But we just thought, yeah, we can do this.
My parents were less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the baby blanket.''
While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most intimate level.
Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the boundaries that define racial territory.
The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race, many people under 18 used that option.
``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
But the process of choosing a child and which categories of children to consider spotlights a family's deepest feelings about race and culture.
So it should be no surprise that race shapes the adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe, more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who often writes about race.
``Part of it is that they can close their eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl, but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair.
But another part, which I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by African-Americans if they adopted a black child.''
Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the United States who need new parents.
The black children who make up, on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian, anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child-welfare agency.
There are many reasons that American families turn to international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle foster care.
For one, foster children are generally older, and most people are looking for infants.
Then, too, many foster children come with siblings.
Some white families say they have been discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two worlds one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to make them a family, and the other with older children in foster care looking for parents whose orbits rarely connect.
In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage.
But when the child's background is different from the parents', that is a more complicated, and more self-conscious process.
Though every adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the issue of group identity.
The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and restaurants his adoptive parents seek out?
Will a Chicago synagogue be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a white family learn about black hair care?
``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,'' Ms. Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put her down and said, `You have to help me learn.'
They taught me about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions.''
The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily answered.
For the children adopted from overseas, there are new institutions to bolster that connection.
Korean adoptees can take their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland tours of their birthplace.
For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white families, there are fewer formal supports.
``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms. Golden, whose family provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with other white families who had black kids.
And even now that they're teen-agers, they stay in touch.
It is important to have a racial identity.
Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she identified that way very early.''
