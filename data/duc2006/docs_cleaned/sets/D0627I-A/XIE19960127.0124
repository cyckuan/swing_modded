number of U.S. adoptive parents and groups involving in adopting children from China refuted reports in the Western media about the so-called abuse of children in Chinese orphanages.
In their letters faxed to the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., they said the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages is unbelievable.
They also commended China for their efforts to improve the welfare of its orphans.
Donna Taylor and Belinda Durham at Catholic Charities said in their fax that "we have been very upset by the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages."
"One person's report, who happened to be a Chinese doctor, who was denied a US visa, cannot be reasonable enough to believe," they said.
"This of course does not reflect our feelings of the Chinese, the experiences of all of my families who have wonderful daughters from China, and those who are planning trips in the near future."
Sharon R. Grasflin said she and her husband have filed an adoption petition with the People's Republic of China in hopes of adopting a precious little girl.
She said her adoption agency, China's Children, allowed her and her husband to look through a notebook in the past month, "full of beautiful, smiling, happy and well cared for Chinese children who are waiting to be adopted."
"Those children were from many different orphanages throughout China.
Cudy Herdson at Tennessee office of China's Children under the Children's Hope International, said that "we ... are very concerned over the recent media publicity about Chinese orphanages.
We just wanted to briefly relay our concern and outrage at the US media for covering such a story."
