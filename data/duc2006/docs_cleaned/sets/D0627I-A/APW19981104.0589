Chinese couples will find it easier and foreigners perhaps more difficult to adopt children under a revised adoption law approved by China's legislature Wednesday, state media reported.
The changes are designed to alleviate overcrowding in cash-strapped state orphanages and find more orphans homes.
Abandonment, especially of baby girls, has soared under strict family planning controls that limit most Chinese couples to having one child.
Passed by the standing committee of the National People's Congress, the revised law reduces the age of prospective Chinese parents from 35 to 30 years, drops a restriction that couples be childless and allows for multiple adoptions, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
The restrictions were originally intended to make sure Chinese families did not orchestrate adoptions to circumvent the one-child limit.
Tight laws at home and a rise in abandonment also helped turn China into a popular place for Westerners, especially Americans, looking to adopt.
Fearing further international condemnation of its much criticized family planning policies, the Chinese government has never said how many children are in state care.
Foreigners adopted 4,191 Chinese children in the 12 months ending in September.
Xinhua reported that the revised law requires prospective adoptive parents from abroad to provide extensive information on their background all notarized by authorities in their home countries.
Foreigners will also have to sign agreements with the person or institution offering the adoption and register it with the Chinese government, Xinhua said.
The report did not indicate how the changes for foreigners differ from current procedures.
The new law also sets out fines and other punishments for people who abandon or sell children, Xinhua said, without elaborating.
