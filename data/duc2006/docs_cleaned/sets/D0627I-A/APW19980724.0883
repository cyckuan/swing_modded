Foreign couples, especially Americans, are scrambling to adopt children in case a new government tightens adoption rules.
``We went from the airport to the orphanage to the embassy.
He arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday, picked up an 18-month-old girl he named Jana Lynn, and they left the country Friday.
At least 22 American families came to adopt babies in the past week, many with less than four days' notice.
Some Europeans also are adopting, but Americans seem to be the most active.
The last couples left town Friday with their new children.
After waiting months, sometimes years, to adopt children, couples were told that if they could collect the children before the elections, there would be no wait.
Many had never considered adopting a Cambodian child before last week.
Giddy parents congregated at the Sunway Hotel with their new Cambodian children, rocking them in soft new baby blankets and dressing them in fuzzy outfits.
``We cleaned out (a nearby orphanage) pretty well,'' Balcerak said.
``There are maybe only a half dozen left.''
Civil war during the 1980s left Cambodia with a surfeit of orphans and an economy too shattered to care for them.
Orphanages would have perhaps one wet-nurse for eight babies meaning most starved.
Cambodia first opened its doors to international adoptions in 1989, and they skyrocketed after a U.N. peacekeeping mission arrived in 1991.
But the country halted foreign adoptions in 1992 for fear that the adoptions could not adequately be monitored.
Adoptions began to resume slowly in 1993, under strict government control.
Fewer orphans have lost both parents because of war; instead, many come from families that cannot afford them.
The doors to foreign adoptions have swung wide open amid the political turmoil that followed a bloody coup last year when strongman Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
The Ministry of Social Action and Veterans Affairs decided that if prospective parents could prove that they met the adoption requirements of their host countries, Cambodia would quickly approve the requests.
U.S.-based agency, Maine Adoption Placement, which has been active in matching American couples with orphans, pushed to have a batch of adoptions arranged before July 25.
Most families said they paid between dlrs 10,000 and dlrs 15,000, about a third of which goes to pay ``processing fees'' to the Cambodian government.
Critics suspect the children are being rushed out of Cambodia by greedy officials who want to line their own pockets in case the elections put their jobs in jeopardy.
The new parents appeared dazed by the whirlwind of events.
``We had 48 hours to throw together two months of paperwork,'' said Michael Shantzis of San Francisco, the new father of an 18-month-old girl named Theany.
Theany spent her last few hours in Cambodia sleeping on a bench in the hotel's restaurant.
Theany's mother, abandoned by her husband, was forced to give her up because she could not afford to raise her, the new parents said.
They hope to find some way to give money to the family.
