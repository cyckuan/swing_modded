The remains of the first victims of EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the plane plunged into the ocean.
The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing the 217 people on board.
The Rhode Island medical examiner's office has been overseeing the identification process.
It has been working with 6,000 tissue fragments and a smaller number of body parts.
Only 1,300 fragments are suitable for DNA testing, and results may not be ready for 10 months.
The National Transportation Safety Board estimated that 70 percent of the aircraft, including one engine, and sections of the wings, tail and body, was recovered.
On Friday, NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would be raised.
''They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures underwater, but it can also help if we have it out of the water to get a closer look at it,'' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must conduct more studies before they settle on a cause.
