Egyptian Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri said on Saturday that he did not rule out the possibility that EgyptAir Flight 990 was downed last year by electromagnetic interference.
Electromagnetic waves could have confused the computer of the Boeing 767, leading to the crash of the plane, el-Demiri said.
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on October 31, killing all 217 people on board.
Egyptian and U.S. investigators released a factual report last month without giving the cause of the incident.
The Egyptian minister, who was commenting on a report in the New York Review of Books magazine, said, however, the theory was speculative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
The U.S. magazine's report said that electromagnetic interferences by military radars in the area, over which the EgyptAir plane was flying, could have caused the sudden shutdown of its computerized auto pilot, the elevators and engines.
El-Demiri said Egypt is still demanding the U.S. to release additional information on the plane's elevators, which controls the nose up or down, and to publish radar images, which the U.S. withheld for reasons of classified military data and might give clues to the tragic incident.
