investigators on Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed October 31.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two "Black Boxes", was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington.
The recorder's tape contains parameters measuring air speed, altitude, settings of engines and many other data, valuable to investigators to determine the cause of the accident which killed all 217 on Board.
The Cairo-bound plane plunged some 60 miles south off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts soon after it took off from New York.
Investigators still wonder whether it was a result of mechanical defects, operational errors or human sabotage.
Two remotely operated vehicles containing sophisticated robots were used to catch the data recoder from depths of more than 70 meters.
