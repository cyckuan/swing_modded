submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
The container that held the recorder, known as a black box, showed signs of damage when it was recovered, but the flight recorder inside seemed to have survived the jetliner's catastrophic impact and nine days of submersion in salt water, investigators said.
``The magnetic tape was removed from its protective casing, cleaned and dried,'' James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday night after investigators in Washington began evaluating the recorder's condition.
``The tape has data on it, and NTSB engineers are currently working to extract information.''
The recovery of the box, and the condition of its contents, appears to have provided the first breaks in what has been a frustrating case.
For much of the past week, investigators and mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused delays in the search for the recorders.
Preliminary radar data has shown that the plane fell precipitously, and three lobstermen reported hearing a strange rumble where the plane slammed into the ocean's surface.
But until the recovery of the data recorder on Tuesday, virtually no other information had been available.
EgyptAir's pilots reported no trouble over their radios before or during the dive, and the wreckage recovered to date has revealed little more than that the great airplane a Boeing 767 with a wingspan of 156 feet and a length of 176 feet was reduced to bits when it struck the sea.
The crash killed all 217 passengers and crewmen.
Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder another, the cockpit voice recorder, remains missing on the sea floor could provide key insights into the crash.
``In any investigation, the most important information comes from the recorders,'' Hall said.
``They can save several steps in the investigatory process.''
The cockpit voice recorder is designed to preserve conversations among the pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit, including the noise from plane alarms, its two engines, or any obvious mechanical problems.
The flight data recorder is designed to record more than 150 categories of information that shows how the plane was flying, how the pilots were handling it and how the aircraft's systems were operating.
Hall said he hopes the recorder ``will paint a picture of what this airplane was doing in its last minutes, and seconds, before this tragedy occurred.''
The black box was discovered before dawn in 245 feet of water by the Deep Drone, a robot submarine that was deployed and controlled from the Grapple, a Navy salvage ship.
The Deep Drone had resumed searching after a more capable robot, known as Magnum and deployed from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest, damaged its fiber optic cable on undersea wreckage.
Within hours of lifting the black box aboard the Grapple, the Navy flew it by helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where it was transferred to Washington.
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are treating all debris recovered from the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was brought down by a crime or terrorism, accompanied the recorder on its trip.
The Navy, working in moderate seas of 5 to 7 feet, planned to continue searching for the remaining black box through the night and into Wednesday morning.
Retrieving the second recorder is important because in some past jetliner accidents, information from the two flight recorders, together, has provided a level of detail that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes.
For example, when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after takeoff from Lima in 1996, the cockpit voice recorder captured the desperate conversation of the two pilots.
``Everything has gone, all the instruments went to ,'' the captain said, as the plane dropped into the Pacific.
The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and determine air speed.
The static ports are crucial because speed cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.
Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved insufficient.
In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground.
