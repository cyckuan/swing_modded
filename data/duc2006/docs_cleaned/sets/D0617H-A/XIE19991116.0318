senior U.S. official raised the possibility Monday of handing over the probe leadership of the EgyptAir Flight 990 to another agency, hinting that the plane was possibly downed by a criminal act.
"We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)," said NTSB Chairman Jim Hall at a press conference here.
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
The EgyptAir passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast on October 31, killing all 217 aboard.
Hall met with FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and other officials Monday to discuss whether there was enough evidence to open a criminal investigation, an Associated Press report quoted a law enforcement official as saying.
