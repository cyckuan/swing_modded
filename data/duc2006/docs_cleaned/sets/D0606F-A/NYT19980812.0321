Global warming is not making some people in the nation's coldest state happy.
As higher temperatures melt some of the ice in Alaska, natives who live in or near the Arctic Circle said here Wednesday they are worried that their way of life will disappear.
Sterling Golongergen, 43, a community development worker in Savoonga, an island town in the Bering Sea, said at a news conference that as the ice melts, hunting gets more difficult.
``But this year the ice packs left sooner.
There was very little game for them to hunt, cut short our food supply'' and the time that her sons had to learn ``how to continue this way of life.''
She added: ``We do not really understand the science or the politics of environmental change, but it affects our lives.''
John Kulowiyi, 76, a whaling captain also from Savoonga, said ice around the village is slowly getting thinner year-round.
``We never go out (to hunt) this year by walking on the ice,'' he said.
``It's too dangerous for us.''
So in order to hunt, the men must travel 50 to 80 miles from the village, which makes the trips expensive for them, he said.
Amy ``Kalee'' Kreider, director of the U.S. global warming campaign for Greenpeace, an environmental organization which sponsored the news conference, said, ``In most of the lower 48 states, ice is seen as bad.
That's not the way things are seen in Alaska.''
These animals are a staple food for villagers in the Bering and Chukchi Seas region near Siberia.
The report said some plants are dying as tundra dries out because permafrost, ground that is frozen all year, is thawing and water is draining off.
Kreider also said the pesky sprucebark beetle has moved further north as temperatures climb.
She said it has already ``devastated a huge swathe of forest in southern Alaska ... as far north as Fairbanks.''
The report cited interviews with natives in eight villages in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.
Kreider said Greenpeace expects Congress to hold hearings in January on the Alaskan climate change and that some of the people quoted in the report will testify.
She urged U.S. approval of the so-called Kyoto Protocol, an accord reached by negotiators around the world last December that would require industrial nations to make significant cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade since the late 1970s.
The panel also said that upper Arctic ice, which had been 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) to 3 meters (just under 9 feet) thick, now averages about 1.5 meters (under 5 feet) or less.
