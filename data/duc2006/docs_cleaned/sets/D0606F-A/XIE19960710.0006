Insurance companies warned here on Tuesday of enormous economic costs if global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions come too slowly.
The warning was made by about 60 insurance companies in a position paper they presented Tuesday to an international negotiating conference on climate change resumed in Geneva on Monday.
The insurers expressed their concern that while the effect of climate change on the frequency or severity of extreme weather events remains unknown, it is clear that even small shifts in regional climate zones or storm patterns could lead to increased property damage.
They also pointed out that climate change could potentially have large implications for investment activities as society anticipates and adapts to new climate regime.
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions to reduce the risks of climate change.
According to them, the most efficient precautionary measure is an early and substantial reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
They also urged governments to promote scientific research that will establish what threshold level of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases should be considered dangerous.
According to industry sources, the insurance industry is currently under stress from a series of "Billion Dollar" storms since 1987.
This has led to dramatic increases in claims, reduced availability of insurance, and higher premiums.
"When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to worry, so should we," commented Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Exective Director of the UN Environment Programme.
"While some industries think more about the costs of taking action against climate change, insurers know from experience how expensive it can be when people fail to protect themselves adequately from risks," she added.
How fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the focus of the latest negotiating conference, known officially as the second session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
In the treaty, which was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, industrialized countries agreed to take measures to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
But some environmental reports said almost none of them will meet that target.
While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major industries in some countries are urging their governments to take a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood.
