Experts attending the '97 China International Environmental Forum warn that failure to limit greeenhouse gas emissions will raise the global mean surface temperature by two degrees centigrades over the next 100 years.
This will in turn raise the sea level by some 50 cm., according to Raul Estrada Oyuela, chairman of Ad Hoc Group Berlin Mandate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
He added that many island states will disappear by then.
People threatened by storms and floods will be forced to migrate, and climate changes will aggravate risks of famine and disease, said Oyuela.
He cited a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which noted that stablization of the concentration of greenhouse gases by the year 2100 will nonetheless be accompanied by rising temperatures and higher sea levels.
Zou Jingmeng, former chairman of the World Meteorological Organization, stressed that further proof is needed to verify the prediction, but noted that people must pay great attention to the possibility of any increase in the global surface temperature.
Experts say the concentration of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, in the atmosphere will continue to rise due to the use of coal, petroleum, fertilizer and excessive deforestation.
Oyuela said the global mean surface temperature over the past one hundred years has climbed by 0.6 centigrades, with a rise in the sea level of between 10-25 centimeters.
He said that a 50 cm rise in the sea level will increase the number of people under the threat of flooding from the current 46 million to 92 million annually.
Climate changes will also increase the risk of heart disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the subtropical and tropical areas, according to experts.
An international climate conference scheduled for next month in Kyoto, Japan, will focus on greenhouse gas emissions.
