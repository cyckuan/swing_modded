Global warming could fundamentally transform a third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
They estimated 20 percent of the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,'' said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham said.
More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.
The projected habitat changes and species extinctions would not be limited to northern latitudes, however.
Coastal and island areas would be at risk from warming oceans and rising waters, the report said.
The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains contentious.
According to a study published in the July issue of the Dutch journal Climate Change, Arctic temperatures in the late 20th century were the warmest in four centuries.
But, critics of the global warming theory argue there's little evidence that forces other than natural temperature swings are at work.
Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea ice, glaciers and plant growth.
''This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a major warming is affecting the Arctic environment,'' said Michael T. Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington, which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five universities in the United States.
Its projections are based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubling from pre-industrial levels by the year 2100.
And even that estimate is optimistic, the report said.
The loss of habitat would place many plant and animal species in a race for their lives, and scientists do not yet know whether they would be able to migrate fast enough to outrun the change.
The report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about 10,000 years ago.
The report said the most vulnerable species are those who live in isolated or fragmented habitats, including the Gelada baboon of Ethiopia; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the monarch butterfly, which spends its winters in Mexico; and the spoon-billed sandpiper of Siberia.
The report is designed to pressure politicians ahead of November's international climate-change summit in the Dutch city of The Hague, at which politicians will attempt to ratify the 1997 Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
''Many countries are trying to find loopholes in the Kyoto agreement,'' said Andrew Kerr of the WWF's Climate Change campaign.
''They should know that the problem is much more of an immediate threat than they realized.''
Added Markham: ''Speed kills.
We're night-driving on a mountain road with the lights switched off.''
