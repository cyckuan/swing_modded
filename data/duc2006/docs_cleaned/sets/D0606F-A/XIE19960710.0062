Climate change is likely to disturb various natural and ecological systems, posing serious threat to human health, said a report jointly released Tuesday by relevant United Nations specialized agencies at a session on global warming issue.
"In destablizing the world's climate and its dependent ecosystems, we are posing new and widespread risks to human health", said the report, which assesses potential health consequences of human-induced climate change, while conceding that much more research needs to be done.
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.
The least direct health effects would be those due to socioeconomic disruption caused by environmental deterioration, the most direct would be those caused by heatwaves, storms and floods.
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as the climate is getting warmer and wetter.
Experts predict a 1-3 centigrade degree growth in global mean surface temperature by the year 2100, and that we would have higher sea level, more heavy rainfalls, more floods, more bushfires, as well as longer and more severe droughts.
Hot weather would lead to up to several thousand extra heat-related deaths annually by around 2050 in many big cities worldwide.
The increase would outweigh the decline in winter-related mortality.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Climate change allows disease vectors to extend territory, helping infectious diseases spread and kill more people.
In the next century, it would increase the global incidence of malaria by 50 to 80 million additional cases annually, and the vulnerable population would rise from the current 45 percent to about 60 percent of the world's total.
The incidence of food-and water-related infections such as cholera would also grow, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, following changes in water distribution, temperature and the proliferation of microorganisms, the report added.
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
In some regions, warmer and wetter climate could also lead to higher concentration in air of various pollens and spores with a possible impact on allergic disorders, such as hay fever and asthma.
It may also impair human immune system, said the report, which was released at the July 8-19 session in Geneva of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
