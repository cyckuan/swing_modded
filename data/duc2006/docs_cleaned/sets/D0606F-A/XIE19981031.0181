The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger because of the climate change.
The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution to the problem.
All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid climate change.
The WWF, the biggest organization in the world for the conservation of nature, has 4.7 million employees who work in 96 countries in the world.
The organization also has a status of official observer in the United Nations.
The Fourth World Conference on the Climate Change will be held here from November 2 to 13.
