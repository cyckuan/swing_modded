Some 1,000 world senior scientists at a summit here today called on world leaders to act immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of human-induced global warming.
"Let there be no doubt about the conclusions of the scientific community: the threat of global warming is very real and action is needed immediately," said Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
"It is a grave error to believe that we can continue to procrastinate."
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the climate.
The scientists meeting today was held six days before a White House conference to propose global actions on the issue.
The scientists' declaration urged all government leaders to demonstrate a new commitment to protecting the global environment for future generations.
The declaration stated that global warming is underway and the overuse of fossil fuels is partly to blame.
It said that climate change is projected to raise sea levels; increase the likelihood of more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts; and endanger human health by greater exposure to heat waves and encroachment of tropical diseases to higher latitudes.
Further, the declaration said, climate change is likely to exacerbate food shortages and spread undernutrition by adversely affecting water supplies, soil conditions, temperature tolerances, and growing seasons.
Climate change will also accelerate the appalling pace at which species are now disappearing, especially in vulnerable ecosystems, it said, adding that possibly one-third of all species may be lost before the end of the next century.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent since preindustrial times.
Over the same period, atmospheric methane has risen by 145 percent, mostly from agricultural activities like growing rice and raising cattle.
As a result, the earth's average surface temperature will increase by 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years, in addition to the increase of 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius that has already occurred since 1860.
Scientists predict that even if people stopped emitting heat-trapping gases now, the climate wouldn't stabilize for many decades because of the gases have already been sent into the atmosphere.
They hold that a strong treaty will be the "first step to protect future generations from dire prospects that would result from failure to meet our responsibilities toward them."
This is a wake-up call for world leaders.
Never before has the senior scientific community spoken so boldly on the urgent need to prevent disruption to our climate," said Nobel laureate Dudley Herschbath, professor of chemistry at Harvard University.
