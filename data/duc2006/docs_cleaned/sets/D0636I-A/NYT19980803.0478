If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company produces most of the parts as well as the final product.
Through the 1970s, GM promoted its vertical integration as a source of financial strength and savings.
But John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman and chief executive, said Monday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large proportion of the parts inside.
The spinoff of the auto parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, ``represents nothing less than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration,'' Smith said.
The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to GM's announcement Monday afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled board meeting.
``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, said in a statement.
General Motors' national contract with the union expires in September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of Delphi then with a strike.
Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the UAW has sometimes forced GM to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the years.
Robert Stempel, the former chairman of GM, announced in December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still open and the jobs still exist.
But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General Motors and its shareholders.
The UAW currently forces GM to pay the same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay only half as much to their workers.
An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its American workers who are members of the UAW.
It might be able to sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and other competitive information with GM.
Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers and parts workers, but they disposed of many of their parts factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when their survival was in doubt.
Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.
Knechtel said then that the strike could only be judged worthwhile if it produced a lasting improvement in the relationship.
Workers ratified the settlement last Wednesday and returned to work, but GM lost $3 billion in after-tax profits because of the strike, or nearly half a year's earnings.
Smith said at a press conference Monday that GM's board had been planning for months to decide on the spinoff of Delphi at its August meeting, but that the company had not told the union until after the Flint strike had ended.
Even if GM divests Delphi, it will still be somewhat vertically integrated.
The Delphi division makes hundreds of smaller parts, from spark plugs to dashboards to seats, that are less important to a car's exterior appearance or road performance.
The strikes in Flint affected two parts factories, a Delphi factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs and other parts and another, non-Delphi factory that stamps truck hoods and other parts from sheets of steel.
But GM's planned spinoff of Delphi nonetheless represents a big decision.
Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., is the world's largest auto parts maker, with slightly greater annual sales than Intel Corp. Delphi's 200,000 employees around the world include 50,000 UAW members in the United States, a sizable number for a union with around 730,000 members.
There are another 150,000 UAW workers in GM's other operations that will not be divested.
General Motors said that it planned to dispose of Delphi in two steps.
During the first quarter of next year, GM plans to distribute to shareholders as much as 20 percent of Delphi's stock.
The automaker said it would dispose of the rest of Delphi later next year, by distributing shares or by exchanging GM shares for Delphi shares, or possibly by a combination of these approaches, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free.
General Motors announced its plan late in the afternoon.
