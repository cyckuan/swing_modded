a four-year contract with 3 percent raises every year, a signing bonus and clauses aimed at protecting union jobs.
``He wanted something that would give him leverage at GM or at Ford.''
The GM contract covers 222,000 workers, including those at Delphi Automotive, GM's former parts division.
The agreement on a new national contract for 75,000 DaimlerChrysler workers came after three months of talks and more than 40 hours of marathon bargaining.
Terms of the tentative agreement were not released by company or union spokesmen.
Recent contracts had in some years paid lump sums rather than percentage increases.
The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported the base wages for assembly workers would reach $22.63 per hour in the fourth year, up from the current $20.11.
Roger Brown, president of Local 550 in Indianapolis, also said he had been told the deal includes a statement by DaimlerChrysler emphasizing its neutrality in union organizing.
The union has said it would like to organize DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 workers and Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.
It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of the UAW's contract.
But by stating its neutrality in the contract, DaimlerChrysler could stay on good terms with its largest union.
In addition, Brown said the deal includes an agreement not to spin off any parts of the company into independent businesses.
Such a clause might be aimed more at GM and Ford than DaimlerChrysler.
Brown and Scott Stanton, vice president of Local 624 in Syracuse, N.Y., also said the deal includes improvements in retiree benefits.
Nearly half of the UAW's 407,000 active autoworkers at GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are eligible for retirement within five years.
``That part of it sounds good,'' said Brown, whose local represents 1,350 workers at a DaimlerChrysler foundry.
``The rest of it we'll have to wait and see when we go to Detroit next week on Monday or Tuesday for an informational meeting.''
Stanton said a ratification vote was scheduled for Sept. 25.
Workers interviewed leaving DaimlerChrysler's truck plant in Warren on Thursday afternoon said they had heard little about the agreement because of the secretive nature of the negotiations.
Some said they were pleased with what they had heard so far.
``We're doing well.
We're working a lot of overtime.
We're building a good product,'' said Matthew Lyons, 46, of Macomb County's Macomb Township.
``Chrysler has been good to us.''
According to the company, the average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler is 43 years old, has 16 years of experience and earns about $70,000 a year, thanks to overtime and profit sharing.
The same worker gets 37 paid vacation days a year.
Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999.
Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories.
The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American production.
According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher wages, and has sought better overtime compensation with more money and extra time off.
In recent years, automakers have held down employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker adds about 9 hours of overtime a week.
Union newsletters also said GM had proposed a lifetime employment guarantee for workers with more than 10 years of experience.
The largest issue between Ford and the union appears to be Ford's plans for Visteon and the unit's 23,500 UAW workers.
The UAW fears a separate parts company would try to cut jobs and lower wages.
Dale Brickner, a retired Michigan State University labor professor, said the no-spinoff clause might be aimed at Ford and GM, which spun off its Delphi parts unit, rather than DaimlerChrysler.
Brickner said the UAW may tell the companies ``you have to pay a price for doing something else with you parts companies.''
