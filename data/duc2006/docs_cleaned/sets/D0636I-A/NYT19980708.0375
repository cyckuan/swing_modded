Negotiators worked steadily Wednesday to resolve a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here, but more signs emerged that any deal would address local disputes and might not produce big improvements in GM's competitiveness.
General Motors Corp. has used the strike as an occasion to warn that it may close car factories and eliminate car models while focusing more on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks a shift in direction that Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already made and that Wall Street analysts would like to see GM duplicate.
Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said in a message to employees this week that GM was working on a ``detailed rationalization plan'' for its factories and models.
But Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, told several reporters Wednesday that little attention had been given to any such move.
``We haven't had really focused discussions on that whole subject,'' he said Wednesday afternoon during a lull in top-level negotiations at a Holiday Inn.
Shoemaker strongly hinted that factory closings could lead to more strikes.
``If as a result of this strike they decide to close facilities, that obviously would not improve the relationship and it would go a long way to continuing confrontations,'' he said.
GM's problem is that as the strike has dragged on, expectations have risen on Wall Street that a settlement will break the pattern of inconclusive deals in a dozen other local strikes over the last five years.
``They had better come up with something this time that is more than `we invest $50 million and agree to give them 100 jobs,''' the typical settlement in other local strikes, said Maryann Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York.
``If it's something along those lines, it won't be enough'' to satisfy institutional investors.
Shoemaker also warned GM on Wednesday not to sell Delphi Automotive Systems, the automaker's parts division.
``That would probably set the stage for a hell of a battle,'' Shoemaker said.
The strikes at two parts factories have forced GM to close 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants.
Even if the parts factories do reopen then, it could take another two weeks for enough parts to be produced to allow the reopening of the 26 GM assembly plants.
