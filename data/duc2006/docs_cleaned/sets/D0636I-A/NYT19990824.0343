After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Co. is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corp. are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say.
The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said.
The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp., which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler AG.
Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles and engines at less efficient factories.
Both moves have alarmed local union officials, who have put pressure on the UAW's national leadership to take a tough stance.
Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit with the Lear Corp. as part of a complicated stock deal.
Those talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the transaction is tax free, but no deal is likely until after the expiration on Sept. 14 of the UAW's contracts with Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler, people close to the negotiations said.
It now appears possible, although still not certain, that the UAW will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler, leaving for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the complicated but less contentious issues at GM.
The union has taken a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski, the union's vice president for DaimlerChrysler issues.
The talks at GM, while complicated and hard to resolve quickly, have been going well.
``They seem to want to work with us,'' much more so than in the past, said a UAW negotiator.
Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with Ford this autumn.
This would make it unlikely that the UAW would also negotiate first with Ford.
The American and Canadian unions have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the same time because the American union is so much bigger that the Canadian union might then receive short shrift.
Hargrove said that if the UAW chose Ford, he would most likely choose another auto maker.
But Hargrove works closely with the UAW, and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the UAW will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know what the UAW would do.
The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three years before reaching contracts, often against the first company with which negotiations are held.
That is mainly because Canadian labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging walkouts in the middle of a contract.
But the result may be to ruin Ford's remarkable string of strike-free years.
Sean McAlinden, the manager of automotive economic studies at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and the UAW, said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Hargrove would call a strike at Ford.
``It forces him to do some sort of walkout every three years to show he has some teeth,'' McAlinden said.
The UAW's contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety reasons.
In Canada and in the United States, the unions are demanding substantial wage and pension increases in addition to continuing the job security provisions that have been a staple of national contracts over the last two decades.
The auto makers are enjoying record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves $24 billion in the case of Ford.
``The companies are doing very, very well,'' Hargrove said.
``The companies are making a lot of money and the workers are entitled to share it.''
Higher wages would put Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler at a disadvantage in competing with imports from countries like Korea and Germany.
But Japanese auto makers now assemble the majority of their vehicles in the United States and tend to match wage increases in Detroit so as to forestall unionization of their American factories.
