General Motors chairman and chief executive John Smith said Wednesday that the world's largest automaker would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America.
The plants would use far less labor than current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM employees.
Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM's efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on other GM factories overseas.
Those factories rely on outside suppliers to produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards, instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together on the assembly line.
That is in keeping with GM's move this week to become a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and trucks but makes few of the parts.
GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on the industry and erodes its membership.
But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build.
The new factories could use half as many workers as the current factories.
In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City, the usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants for the first time, part of a broad vision to change GM, the world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global economic output.
Smith said this week's moves had long been planned and that the strike had only delayed them a little.
But Smith has also been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to make GM more competitive.
Many institutional investors had expected GM to inflict a crushing blow to the UAW at the end of a strike that cost the company $3 billion in after-tax earnings, and have pushed down the company's stock in response to the very limited settlement that actually resulted.
Smith discussed his plans for the company in Traverse City at midday and GM stock closed at $68.375, down $1.125.
Smith refused to discuss Wednesday when or where GM would build its new assembly plants, which would be its first in the United States since the construction of the 7,000-employee Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., in the 1980s.
``We are planning on building some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants,'' Smith said.
``The new plants will be lean and agile in every respect, operating 24 hours a day.''
After describing the large role that suppliers play in Brazil, Smith said, ``We believe that vehicle manufacturing will evolve in this direction here in North America.''
Ronald Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich., said GM would probably start by building one of the new type of assembly plant, which could take a couple of years, and then watch how it worked before building more.
Next to each new assembly plant, GM plans to put a factory that could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of steel, Smith said.
That plan sheds new light on GM's strong stand against the UAW during the recent strike in Flint, Mich. GM tried unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closure if GM builds new stamping factories.
In an olive branch to the powerful UAW, Smith said Wednesday that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders and planned to discuss how the new factories would work.
Speaking at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry conference here in this Lake Michigan resort, 200 miles northwest of Detroit, Smith also promised repeatedly that GM would not lay off anyone in the coming years, but would rely instead on allowing workers to retire without replacing them.
With a steadily shrinking market share, GM has hired few employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left in the United States, mostly represented by the UAW The automaker has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker produces annually.
``How do we close the productivity gap without costly work stoppages is the clear focus in my head,'' Smith said.
The strikes in Flint severely hurt GM's sales in July.
The company said Wednesday that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped 37.7 percent, as car sales plunged 45.0 percent while sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent.
GM's overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent, trailing Ford Motor Co., at 27.5 percent, for the first time since a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled GM's production.
GM's plans to build efficient new factories might well provoke a flurry of offers of tax incentives and other financial assistance from state governments, Mexico and Canada.
Smith avoided saying whether GM would put any of the new assembly plants in Mexico.
But he did say that GM was considering the construction of new plants close to existing ones.
The UAW's contracts with the Big Three automakers give workers the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50 miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime employment.
