British police launched a series of crackdown on "hated crime" across the capital on Wednesday, arresting some 70 suspected racists.
The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena, a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital.
Those taken for questioning were alleged to have committed offenses ranging from the publication of racist material to racially aggravated assaults.
"Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who, because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and destroy the principle of 'Justice for All'," said Detective Chief Superintendent John Godsave, who headed the operation.
Godsave said the raid, in all 32 of the capital's local districts, was part of the Met's anti-racist Operation Athena.
The suspected offenses ranged from grievous bodily harm to the publication of racist material.
The age and sex of the suspects was not released but police said the arrests spanned Hounslow, an Asian stronghold in the west of the city, to Greenwich, a wealthy white enclave in southeast London.
"Our goal is to eradicate the fear and distress caused by hate crime," Godsave said in a statement.
Britain is 94 percent white but ethnic minorities have a stronger presence in the inner cities, London chief among them.
Yet the Met's record on promoting black and Asian officers, rooting out racist staff and clamping down on racially motivated crime have all come under fire.
An official report last year condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism.
The dawn raids came as police questioned three men in connection with the country's most notorious racist crime: the unsolved 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Two were arrested in London, the third in Scotland.
The number of racist crimes being reported in Britain was rising sharply.
Police believe greater awareness has encouraged more victims to come forward.
