The chief of Britain's largest police force apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations between police and minorities.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him.
``We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a central concern is that the Met is racist.
Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus stop by a group of white attackers.
The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and incompetently in resolving the case.
Two men were charged, but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the case.
The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign.
