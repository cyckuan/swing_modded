Britain said Wednesday it plans to keep a 12-year ban on Louis Farrakhan entering the country, but gave the militant U.S. black leader a last chance to appeal despite his ``clearly offensive'' views.
``Mr. Farrakhan now has the opportunity to make further representations before the Home Secretary takes a final decision,'' the statement added.
Straw, in charge of immigration, had considered lifting the ban after Farrakhan last month signed a pledge not to make attacks on whites, Jews and homosexuals while in Britain.
He also said he recognized that under Britain's Race Relations Act it is an offense to stir up racial antagonism.
However, Farrakhan's chance of an entry visa was apparently dashed when 20 supporters of his Nation of Islam movement on Monday disrupted an inquiry into the racially motivated murder of a black teenager in London, Stephen Lawrence.
They burst into the inquiry room when five white suspects started testifying.
Lawrence's parents appealed to the militants not to disrupt the inquiry.
The Home Office said Straw reached his decision after reviewing the ban and ``recent events at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.''
Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Farrakhan ``has clearly offensive views.''
The Board of Deputies of British Jews also lobbied the government to keep the ban, imposed when Farrakhan planned to visit in 1986.
