senior Scotland Yard police officer Wednesday apologized to the parents of a black teenager slain five years ago in a race killing that has become the focus of debate over relations between police and ethnic minorities.
Ian Johnston, assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner for southeast London, told Neville and Doreen Lawrence that he ``could not justify'' errors in the investigation into the stabbing and death of Stephen Lawrence, 18, at a London bus stop on April 2.
It has been a tragedy for you, you have lost a son and not seen his killers brought to justice,'' Johnston told Mr. Lawrence at a public inquiry into the teenager's death.
Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.
Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence.
Johnston said that the case had had a severe impact on police relations with London-based black Britons, saying that the inability to solve the case had been ``a tragedy for the Metropolitan Police who have lost the confidence of a significant section of the community for the way we have handled the case.''
