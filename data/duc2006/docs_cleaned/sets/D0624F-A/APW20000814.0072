Britain defended its record in fighting racism before a U.N. panel Monday but conceded that the tone of the country's recent asylum debate could provoke racial tension.
Britain ''remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is seen as a tolerant and diverse society,'' British delegation leader Sarah Marshall told the 18-member Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
She noted that Britain received 71,160 asylum applications last year, up 55 percent from the year before.
The increase comes among a recent focus on immigration by the country's leading political parties.
The opposition Conservative Party has accused the Labor Party government of making Britain a ''soft touch'' for migrants and called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centers.
The Labor Party, hoping to deter asylum seekers, in March cut cash grants previously paid to them.
The government also said more would be forced to settle outside London and announced heavy fines for truckers caught smuggling illegal immigrants.
They claimed Britain ''has failed to take adequate measures to protect the human rights of ethnic minorities, leaving millions of people vulnerable to discrimination, violence and social exclusion.''
Marshall conceded Monday that ''the tone of some debate around asylum has led ... to incidents of racial harassment against settled minority communities.''
But she said asylum-seekers will be better off under new British policy that clears up confusion and speeds up the processing of asylum claims.
She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately.
The killing prompted a national debate on racism and on police handling of such crimes.
''The worst incidents of race-hate violence in recent years were the Brixton and Soho nail bombs last year,'' Marshall said.
''They were perpetrated by a loner who is now confined to a secure state hospital.''
She was referring to white supremacist David Copeland.
Copeland was given six life sentences in June for the 1999 bombing campaign against minorities in London that killed three people and injured more than 100 others.
The U.N. committee is meeting to review the records of some of the 150 nations that are party to the 1969 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
The United States' race record is not among those being reviewed.
Britain submitted a 72-page report to the panel, which is expected to issue its conclusions Aug. 25.
