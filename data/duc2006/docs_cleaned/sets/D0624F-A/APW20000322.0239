Police cracked down on racial intolerance, arresting three men in connection with the 1993 killing of a black teen-ager, and picking up 100 suspected racists in separate raids around the capital Wednesday.
The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such crimes.
Five white youths were identified as suspects after the April 1993 killing in east London.
None has been successfully prosecuted.
The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp. program for anyone with information about the slaying to contact police.
Their identities were not made public.
Police said none of the arrests resulted from the television appeal, but that it had prompted more than 70 telephone calls, some of which were useful.
''Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who, because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and destroy the principle of justice for all,'' said Detective Chief Superintendent John Godsave.
He said none of the arrests appeared to be linked to any far-right racist group or the Lawrence case.
Wednesday's raids stemmed from the work of units set up in June in each of the capital's 32 boroughs to target those responsible for racist crimes.
