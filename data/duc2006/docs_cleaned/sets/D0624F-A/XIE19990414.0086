British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales.
Straw said he hoped that in 10 years' time, every force in England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it served.
"There is a real determination within the police service by officers of every rank to put the past in terms of attitudes to race behind them," the home secretary said.
The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform.
The Metropolitan Police in London, which investigated the death of the black 18-year-old, faces one of the toughest challenges.
Only 3.3 percent of its officers are black or Asian, according to Home Office figures.
It will have to increase this to more than a quarter in line with London's population.
Only four of England and Wales' 43 regional forces are on track to meet the targets.
Home Office research also showed that black and Asian police officers are almost three times more likely to be sacked than their white colleagues, and it takes a black constable about 18 months longer to be promoted to sergeant than a white constable and 12 months longer for Asian officers.
