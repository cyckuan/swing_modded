British Home Secretary Jack Straw Tuesday promised new measures to combat racism in the wake of the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about "real, practical change."
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993.
The new measures would focus on tackling "institutionalized racism" in the police service, with a shake up of training and procedures.
But Straw warned that the government had "serious reservations" about proposals to allow prosecutions for racist offenses which take place in private.
He also stressed that changes to the double jeopardy principle, whereby a defendant could not be tried for the same offense twice, would be considered without any firm prospect of action.
The action plan aims to bring the police fully within the remit of the Race Relations Act and states that all aspects of policing will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws.
Straw said he would lead a steering group including members from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police organizations and the Crown Prosecution Service to enact most of the recommendations.
"We recognize that action to tackle racism must begin at the earliest stage and be carried out across all agencies," he said.
