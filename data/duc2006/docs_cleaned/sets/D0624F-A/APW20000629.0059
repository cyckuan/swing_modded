The mother of a black British teen-ager slain by white youths presented Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement award Thursday in recognition of his fight to end apartheid.
''I'm sure that I can speak for all South Africans, black and white, that this award is recognition of their struggle for peace and democracy in our country,'' the former South African president said.
Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in 1993.
She said Mandela was the only person of world stature to take up her cause.
After a long campaign by Lawrence, an official inquiry found that police bungled the investigation and were racist.
None of the five white suspects was successfully prosecuted.
Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the award ceremony ranked among the important occasions of his life, adding, ''There's a possibility that one day I might die, and when I reach the new world I will have many fond memories.''
