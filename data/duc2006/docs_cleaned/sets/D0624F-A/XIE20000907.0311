The Prince of Wales Thursday launched a scholarship to try to open up architecture to the ethnic minorities, in memory of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
His Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment will pay about 10,000 pounds (14,500 U.S. dollars) a year to fund an ethnic minority student through architectural school, the BBC reported.
"How wonderful it would be if, through my foundation, we could help to increase the proportion of black and ethnic minority practitioners in the field of architecture," Prince Charles said.
Stephen Lawrence was cruelly robbed of the chance to develop his potential talents in the field of architecture.
Stephen, who was studying for his A-levels when he was murdered by racists in April 1993, had always wanted to be an architect.
He was on a work placement with a firm of architects.
The prince expressed his "deepest sympathy" to Stephen's parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture in London.
The memorial lecture will be an annual event aimed at inspiring young black and Asian people.
