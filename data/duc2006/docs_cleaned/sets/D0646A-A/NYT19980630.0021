Allegations of policy perjury made by federal prosecutors and a state judge are devastating challenges to the integrity of the Police Department that must be answered with utmost speed.
The U.S. attorney's office is looking into possible perjury and cover-up charges.
But the department must not wait for the federal authorities to take the lead.
It should begin an aggressive investigation into the perjury allegations.
Baez died of asphyxiation during a confrontation with Livoti in 1994.
Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in 1996 by a State Supreme Court justice, who nonetheless called the testimony of the other officers a ``nest of perjury.''
Livoti was dismissed from the department in 1997 after an administrative trial found that he had used an illegal chokehold against Baez.
None of the officers accused of lying under oath, however, ever faced administrative punishment or criminal charges, despite the statement of the Bronx judge.
The glaring inconsistencies in testimony in the federal case are now too numerous for the department to brush aside.
Three officers testified that they saw Baez struggle and stagger, suggesting that he was not rendered unconscious by the chokehold that the city's medical examiner says was the cause of death.
Yet other witnesses contradict that account.
The medical evidence suggests that the story given by Livoti's defenders simply is not plausible.
The department must account for police testimony that was not believed in a court of law.
The truthfulness of the police is at the heart of two other prominent brutality cases.
The Daily News has reported that accounts filed by detectives on the shooting of Antoine Reid, an unarmed squeegee man, by officer Michael Meyer seem calculated to protect Meyer by suggesting that the shooting occurred during a robbery attempt.
No such attempt was described by witnesses interviewed by the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, which is now investigating the discrepancy.
Similar charges of a cover-up are central to the inquiry into the attack against Abner Louima.
The department cannot protect the community if there is reason to question the veracity of officers on the beat and on the witness stand.
Rooting out any officer who gives false testimony must be made a top priority by the department, the Mayor and prosecutors.
