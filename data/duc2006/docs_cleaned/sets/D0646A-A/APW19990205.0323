Former Northwestern running back Dennis Lundy admitted Friday that he intentionally fumbled near the goal line in a 1994 game to protect a bet he made against his team.
Lundy also acknowledged he lied to a federal grand jury investigating gambling at Northwestern when he denied he had bet on games.
Lundy pleaded guilty to one count of perjury in a U.S. District Court.
He admitted fumbling on purpose during the 1994 game against Iowa so his team would not cover the point spread and he would win a $400 bet.
He also said he bet on Northwestern games against Ohio State and Notre Dame.
An assistant coach overheard the accusation and the school launched an investigation, which was quickly turned over to federal authorities and led to the indictments of Lundy and three other former players.
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Lundy would be sentenced to six months to a year in prison, but prosecutors will recommend less time as part of their plea agreement with him, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Vogel said.
Sentencing is scheduled for May 5 before U.S. District Judge David H. Coar.
Lundy must cooperate with authorities and speak to college athletes about the perils of gambling.
Lundy was indicted Dec. 3 on perjury charges along with former players Christopher Gamble, Michael Senters and Gregory Gill.
Gamble pleaded guilty last month to lying to the grand jury.
The others have pleaded innocent.
