Tomorrow will mark the start of hard times for more than two million smokers in the Chinese capital, when public places just say "no" to smoking tomorrow.
Some 80,000 people will go to the areas to enforce the ban tomorrow, stopping and fining offenders.
The ban was passed by the Municipal People's Congress, the local legislative body, last December, and has gained wide support, although half the adult males are still smoking, and the number of women and teenagers who puff is on the rise.
Of course, chewing gum companies have been eager to take the opportunity to cash in, collecting money that used to be used to support the habit.
Different types of gum began appearing and being heavily advertised in recent times, selling themselves as "good companions" to those who want to kick the habit.
Officials, government employees, medical personnel, and teachers have taken the lead in the fight against smoking, according to the Beijing Patriotic Public Health Campaign Committee, headquarters of the anti-smoking drive, and about 500 schools, hospitals, department stores, and other units have adopted measures to become "smoke-free units", according to the committee.
