drastic anti-smoking bill cleared a key legislative hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving the way for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and public places.
The planned law, one of the toughest in the world, bans all tobacco advertising.
It outlaws smoking in public and the workplace, but provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are created for workers desperate for a puff.
Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the ban, said committee member Ruth Rabinowitz.
But she said she personally considers the bill too extreme.
``Its intentions are good, but it is not good law making,'' she said ``Some of it is far too draconian.''
Opposition lawmakers oppose the bill, but the ruling African National Congress' overwhelming majority guarantees passage of its bills through all committees.
Tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount a constitutional challenge to the law, which is expected to be passed by full Parliament early next month.
The panel approved minor amendments to lighten the bill, such as granting permission for tobacco logos to be displayed on clothing.
But it tightened other areas, banning all advertising from showing tobacco use, even if the product is not tobacco related.
The top fine for smoking at work or in public places would be 200 rand (dlrs 35).
Advertising violations could generate fines of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
