Cigarette smoking in public has been outlawed in 71 major Chinese cities and three provinces, according the Chinese Association on Smoking Health.
"We believe the number of cities and province banning smoking at public places will go higher soon because the whole country is promoting an anti-smoking drive," Han Changlin, vice-president of the association, told Xinhua today.
The smoking bans of these places mainly cover public transportation facilities, schools, cinemas, theaters, meeting halls, hospitals, department stores, museums, stadiums, and so on.
Many big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing municipalities, and Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an and other cities took similar measures after Changzhi of north China's Shanxi Province initiated the no-smoking law in November, 1989.
The local legislative bodies passed regulations, or city governments published orders, to prohibit tobacco use in public.
The provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, and Shandong also enacted the smoking bans.
"It is urgent to step up anti-smoking measures, since smoking and second-hand smoking have become a serious public health hazard in China," Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said earlier this month.
Health officials and experts said to ban smoking in public places should play a leading role in the anti-tobacco campaign in the country.
China has some 350 million smokers and more than 400 million passive smokers, and the rate of teenage smoking is still on rise.
Over 70 percent of lung cancer cases resulted from smoking, according to a study conducted by the Cancer Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in Chinese cities with a population of more than one million, "Death toll related to tobacco use will climb to two million annually by the year 2020, from some 500,000 at present, if we don't take actions immediately," Minister Chen warned.
Chinese authorities in charge of health and transportation have jointly prohibited tobacco from passenger trains, ships, planes, buses, subways, taxi cabs, ferry boats, cable cars, and waiting rooms at railway stations, airports, and seaports, from May 1.
The action is a strong support to the country's endevours to create a clean and no-smoking environment for the Chinese people, the health officials said.
