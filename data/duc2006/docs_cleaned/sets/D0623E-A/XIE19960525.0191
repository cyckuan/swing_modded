China's cigarette industry appears to be losing its puff for the first time ever, with sales and production falling in the first four months of this year, the "China Daily" reported.
Nationwide anti-smoking campaigns and rising production costs have taken their toll on the industry, which fuels the habits of over 300 million smokers.
The industry, boasting nearly 180 cigarette factories, churned out 56.66 million cigarettes in the first four months of this year, an 1.7 per cent drop from 57.625 million in the same period last year, according to the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau(STMB).
"This is a normal situation, because usually cigarettes see brisk sales prior to the Spring Festival.
More often than not, the sales drops markedly afterwards," an STMB official said.
"But the influence of the smoking ban in public places in 26 cities throughout the country cannot be ruled out," the official added.
"Although we expect an upturn in the sales and production in the second half of this year, the outlook is not rosy," he said.
In response to the national anti-smoking movements, STMB has slashed its planned output to 1,712.5 billion cigarettes this year, down from the actual production of 1,736 billion last year.
However, as one of the country's largest tax generators, the industry turned in 25.5 billion yuan (three billion US dollars) in profits and taxes, a marked 16 percent rise over the same period of last year.
The official attributed the rise in profits to the increased production of famous-brand cigarettes and those with filter-tips, which sell for a higher price.
Output of as many as 50 famous-brands has topped 17.34 million over the first four months, accounting for 30 percent of total volume, up 6.7 percent from last year.
"Nevertheless, cost hikes in raw materials like tobacco, filter tips, paper, and packaging as well as rise in prices of water and electricity, has trimmed at least three billion yuan off the expected revenue for the period," he said.
