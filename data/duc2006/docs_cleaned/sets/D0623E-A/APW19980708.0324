Police in Thailand have announced they will start enforcing a law banning smoking in public places, Thai newspapers reported Wednesday.
Assistant city police commissioner Maj. Jongrak Juthanon announced the policy after meeting the head of the government's anti-smoking body, Dr. Waraporn Pumisawat, who complained that the ban was not being enforced, the newspaper The Nation reported.
The Non-smokers' Health Protection Act and the Tobacco Products Control Act came into effect earlier this year.
They impose fines of 2,000-20,000 baht (dlrs 50-dlrs 500) for smoking in such places as government offices, buses, malls, supermarkets, barbershops, tailor shops, beauty salons and drug stores.
Restaurateurs who do not arrange non-smoking areas in their restaurants will also be fined.
Police Maj. Jongrak was quoted as saying that police initially would apply light penalties against offenders in an effort to raise public awareness.
