handful of New Jersey towns considering developing local smoking bans may have second thoughts after last week's court ruling striking down Princeton's broad anti-smoking ordinance.
''It will certainly put a damper on and intimidate the (communities considering new local smoking restrictions) from moving ahead,'' Regina Carlson, executive director of the anti-smoking nonprofit New Jersey GASP, told The Times of Trenton for Monday's editions.
Bans are in place already in several towns, but none of the existing anti-smoking ordinances are as sweeping as the one in Princeton, which would have been the strictest in the state.
It prohibited lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces, restricting smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors.
Violators faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
In the 64-page ruling, Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda R. Feinberg said the Princeton Regional Health Commission did not have the authority to enact the ban for fire-safety purposes.
The judge also held that the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.
Carlson said a few New Jersey towns - including Cherry Hill and Ocean City - had considered implementing a similar ban, but were waiting for the outcome of the Princeton case.
Ocean City Mayor Henry Knight said the proposed anti-smoking measure there likely will be dropped following the advice of the city solicitor.
Rutgers University law professor Robert Williams said the future of anti-smoking laws in other towns depends on whether the decision last Tuesday is upheld on appeal.
''It's only one judge's decision until there's a more authoritative decision from an appeals court,'' he said.
The health commission has not yet decided whether to appeal.
