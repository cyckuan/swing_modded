Jordan, where one in four smokes, has complained of a great loss caused by smoking.
Jordanian Anti-Smoking Society President Mohammad Shreim told a seminar Sunday that smoking costs Jordan at least 166 million Jordanian dinars (about 234 million U.S. dollars) a year in economic and public health losses.
The seminar was held to mark the International Anti-Smoking Day.
The figure was far more than the sum of revenues collected from domestic cigarette production and imports, Shreim was quoted by the semi-official Jordan Times Monday.
Jordan's cigarette imports stand at 90 million dinars (about 127 million dollars) every year.
Smokers in Jordan, accounting for nearly one-fourth of its 4.5 million inhabitants, spend 134 million dinars (about 190 million dollars) on cigarettes every year, Shreim said.
Mohammad Ali Khan, who represents the World Health Organization at the seminar, said that Jordan has also found common grounds with other Middle East countries in the fact that the majority of its youths have slid into smoking.
The fact predicted a worse picture of economic and public health situation for the kingdom in the future, he added.
Jordan has enacted law banning smoking in public places, but many people ignore.
Meanwhile, smuggling of foreign-made cigarettes is rampant in the country.
