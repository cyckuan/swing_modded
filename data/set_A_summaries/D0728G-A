-- U.S. doctors said that a combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the standard single medicine, said the Washington Post. In the United States nearly 4 million people are believed to have hepatitis C, with about 10,000 deaths from the disease each year. The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. For the time being interferon is the only treatment. Typically only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are rid of all signs of the virus, and most will eventually relapse.
