YORK (AP. ``I love the printed word and have always appreciated the unique connection between author and reader,'' said Oprah Winfrey. ``This magazine provides a different way for people to be informed and inspired.''

The new magazine, which will debut in the spring with 850,000 copies, will have a cooperative relationship with the Oprah.com Web site.
