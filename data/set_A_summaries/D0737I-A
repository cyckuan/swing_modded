-- Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years. Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited. The exploration wells drilled by the company in the waters near Warri in southwest Nigeria have shown encouraging signs that could lead to commercial development, said Shell manager Kisito Okpere. Shell will also carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Cote d'Ivoire.
