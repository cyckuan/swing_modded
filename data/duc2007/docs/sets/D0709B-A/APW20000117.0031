	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The friendly mouse has given way to the neighborhood
bully.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday," starring Ice Cube as a man on the run from a vengeful bully,
bumped off the reigning box-office champ, the mouse tale "Stuart Little,"
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequel to the 1995 film "Friday" took in $14.5 million Friday through
Sunday. The movie has grossed $19.1 million since opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little," the No. 1 movie three of the last four weekends, dropped to
second place with $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane," which opened in limited release for Academy Award
consideration around Christmas, expanded to 1,454 theaters Friday and came in at
No. 3 for the weekend with $9.1 million. The movie stars Denzel Washington in
the prison saga of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girl, Interrupted," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie as mental
patients, also broke out of limited release and grabbed fourth place with $8.2
million in 1,902 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernova," a sci-fi adventure featuring James Spader and Angela Bassett,
fizzled with $5.7 million in 2,280 theaters, debuting in eighth place.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in just 1,103 theaters, "Next Friday" averaged an impressive $13,146
a screen, compared with $6,259 for "The Hurricane" and $4,311 for "Girl,
Interrupted."
</P>
<P>
	   The first "Friday" movie did a modest $27 million at theaters but went on to
become a video hit. "Next Friday" already has done about two-thirds of that
box-office business and grossed twice its production budget in just five days.
</P>
<P>
	   With strong appeal to black movie-goers, the film also benefitted from
release during the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, when movie-going
is up because many people have today off work.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday" drew well among 18-to-25-year-old white crowds, too, said
David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New Line, which released the movie.
Other recent hits with black casts, such as "The Best Man," have had similar
crossover appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie played well in white areas. We were sold out all over the place,"
Tuckerman said. "It appeals to all audiences. It just feels like the country is
maturing about that."
</P>
<P>
	   In "Next Friday," Ice Cube has another battle with the bully from the first
movie, who gets out of prison bent on revenge. The comedy offered some frivolous
fare in a movie market crowded with Oscar contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   "All these Oscar films are terrific, but in terms of audience satisfaction
and escapist entertainment, this offers people something they've been waiting
for," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which
tracks the box office. "A lot of teens have felt left out of the market the last
six weeks or so."
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" crossed the $100 million mark Saturday, grossing $106.8
million in about five weeks. Also hitting that milestone was Tom Hanks' "The
Green Mile," which has taken in $101.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the 18th and 19th films released in 1999 to pass $100 million,
breaking the record of 18 movies set in 1998, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Next Friday," $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "Stuart Little," $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "The Hurricane," $9.1 million.
</P>
