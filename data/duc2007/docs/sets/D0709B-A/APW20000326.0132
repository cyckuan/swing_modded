<HEADLINE> Angelina Jolie Takes Home Oscar  </HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient
in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting
actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised nobody's ever fainted up here,'' the 24-year-old
actress said, thanking numerous people including her father, Jon
Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for
''Midnight Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father,'' Jolie said.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's honor was the night's first major award of the evening.
''Topsy-Turvy'' won two early awards, for makeup and costume
design, while ''The Matrix'' won for sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the
ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial
Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy
members.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher
for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with
Billy Crystal as host.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar
conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The
Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't
Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House
Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   When nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and ''The
Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture. The
standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put on
an ad blitz. DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, academy voters complained that they hadn't received their
ballots for the final vote. By the time a large supply of the
ballots was found in a post office, the academy had printed new
ballots. The academy also extended the voting deadline a few days
to last Thursday, meaning the accountants had to work overtime on
awards weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then came The Mystery of the Missing Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   A shipment of 55 shiny new Oscar statuettes from the Chicago
manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway Express on
March 8. Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52 of the
missing awards while rummaging through a trash container. Three
Oscars remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity. He was given a $50,000
reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars. That's not a lot
of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending
millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he
pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway trucker was charged with stealing the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the awards presentations, the academy announced the
evening's special awards: Warren Beatty was named for the Irving
Thalberg Award for a high level of producing. Among his producer
credits: ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Shampoo,'' ''Reds'' and ''Dick
Tracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland, won an honorary award
''for showing both the loftiest heights and the darkest depths of
the European soul.'' His films include ''Landscape after Battle,''
''Man of Marble'' and ''Man of Steel.''
