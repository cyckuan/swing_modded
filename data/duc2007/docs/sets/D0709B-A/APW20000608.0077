<HEADLINE> Jolie Denies Relationship Gossip  </HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie has it all: the awards, her
choice of Hollywood roles and the adoration of gossip columnists
who have found the motherlode.
</P>
<P>
   After Jolie's gushing words of love for her brother at the
Oscars in March, rumor-mongers hinted at incest. After her
whirlwind Vegas marriage to Billy Bob Thornton last month, the
gossip mill had Jolie breaking up Thornton's relationship with
Laura Dern. After word leaked out about a steamy scene between
Jolie and Antonio Banderas for an upcoming movie, the tabloid
talkers speculated they were fooling around for real.
</P>
<P>
   None of it is true, Jolie said in an interview to promote her
new movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts when people just make light of things that are
important to you,'' Jolie said. ''Like taking your relationship
with your brother, which is a very beautiful thing, and twisting it
so your parents are watching the TV, it's a moment they'll remember
forever, and now rather than seeing a beautiful moment for their
children, they're thinking, 'Oh, my God, the whole world is calling
our children perverted publicly.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie said she and brother Jamie Haven, the children of actor
Jon Voight, are close siblings, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually felt like the people who wrote that should be a
little embarrassed because they came up with it,'' Jolie said.
''That's what's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her abrupt nuptials to Thornton, Jolie laughs off rumors
that he married her only as a friend who felt she needed looking
out for. They met while filming ''Pushing Tin'' two years ago but
did not become involved until a few months ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the rumor is he's with me because he wants to look after
me, I think that's beautiful,'' Jolie said. ''He does look after
me. And I wouldn't be half as strong and clear and OK as I am today
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Thornton has been married four times before and Jolie
once previously, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, she said this marriage
will last. The latest of her 10 tattoos is on her left shoulder,
reading ''Billy Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it will be forever,'' Jolie said. ''If I didn't meet
him until I was older, during those years I probably would have
been married four times, too. ... This is different. I know we've
found each other now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes,
for the title role in the HBO movie ''Gia,'' about a supermodel who
died of AIDS; for the TV movie ''George Wallace''; and for last
year's theatrical film ''Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporting-actress Oscar came for that film, in which she
played a vampish sociopath in a mental ward.
</P>
<P>
   After that movie, Jolie said, she needed something down to
earth. She took the role of Sway, a former car thief drawn into one
last night of robbery to help her ex-lover, played by Nicolas Cage,
in ''Gone in 60 Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a departure for her and a chance to just have fun,''
said director Dominic Sena. ''It wasn't like she was carrying the
picture. She got to be one of the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie cops yet another new hairstyle for the movie, a wig with
long blond dreadlocks, a sharp contrast to her current brunette
color. As she sits crosslegged on a bed in the Four Seasons hotel
for her interview, Jolie's simple white T-shirt and blue jeans also
contrast with Sway's flashy style.
</P>
<P>
   Sena and producer Jerry Bruckheimer said Jolie threw herself
into the role, even buying an old jalopy that she tore apart to
learn about cars and auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two different lives, your work life and your private
life, and she was into her work life,'' Bruckheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jolie's private life, ''she's beautiful, she's smart,
she's interesting,'' Bruckheimer said. ''She doesn't fit a mold
that Hollywood would love to put on her. She's kind of the bad
girl, which people love. So she creates a lot of print.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Jolie stars as Lara Croft in ''Tomb Raider,'' based on
the video game. Shooting starts in July, and the movie is due out
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's another choice that may raise eyebrows, given the critical
acclaim Jolie has earned. But Jolie said Lara is a good role model,
and the actress doesn't care how her professional and personal
choices are perceived.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my responsibility is to my work and what the films
say,'' Jolie said. ''My personal life, however it's interpreted,
it's not my responsibility to have a personal life that everybody's
comfortable with.''
