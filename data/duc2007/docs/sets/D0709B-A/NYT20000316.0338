<P>
   As a thriller, ``The Bone Collector'' is a bit above average _
creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
</P>
<P>
   But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring
roles _ Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for
his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,''
and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod
for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier
in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being
that Washington's character _ forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme _ is
a quadriplegic. Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
He remains on the force, however _ albeit bedridden and surrounded
by an array of high-tech gadgetry _ and continues to help solve
crimes. Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme
recognizes has potential to be more.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both
playing variations of roles that they are known for. Even in action
roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and _ except for
flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed _ that's what you
see in this film. But Washington, a former best supporting actor
Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little. And while his Rhyme
character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with
strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real
than any of the events in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem
dangerous _ either to themselves, others or both. Donaghy is no
exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage. It's not the
character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality,
that keeps you watching. Jolie, the daughter of Academy
Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of
Emmys. Oscar won't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in
the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to
win the Oscar. But win or lose, go back and check out some of
Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike
Lee _ ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got
Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he
played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he
won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995),
which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under
Fire'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's
``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played
outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS. &QL;

MAKING SENSE
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for the force _ the force that will be brewing with
the VHS release of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,''
on April 4. That's right, despite all the digital elements in the
film, George Lucas' prequel to his three hit films will not be
released on DVD. Go figure. But last year's surprise hit and this
year's Oscar nominee for best picture ``The Sixth Sense'' will come
out on DVD March 28. &QL;

($107.37) and is $29.98 on DVD. &QL;
