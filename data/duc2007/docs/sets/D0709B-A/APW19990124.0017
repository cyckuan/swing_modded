<HEADLINE> Harris, Redgrave Win Golden Globes </HEADLINE>

	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare In  
Love'' and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture 
acting, and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV 
comedy actor at the Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and  
Monsters'' won motion picture supporting actor honors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which  
the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a 
touching note. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Spin City'' star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's  
disease, thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up 
his brain. ``We're so lucky to do what we do ... and just take 
every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and  
muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also 
won best screenplay. In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy 
agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for 
show tunes into a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor. ``My  
career must be slipping. This is the first time I've been available 
to pick up an award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading  
movie nominees, with six apiece. ``Saving Private Ryan'' followed 
with five. ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and 
``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued  
by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing 
momentarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show  
by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, 
I just got through eating dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the  
summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their 
award-worthy product. ``I'm glad that people didn't forget about 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging  
horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 
years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been 
crying out for a friend ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The  
Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor 
and actress, respectively in television dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series  
for ``Dharma and Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hanks, nominated for as best actor in ``Saving Private  
Ryan,'' picked up an early honor for his ``From the Earth to the 
Moon,'' which won best miniseries or movie made for TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for  
``Gia,'' which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting 
actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie. The latter category 
was a tie, with Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice'' picking up the 
other award. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Tucci of ``Winchell'' won best actor in a miniseries or  
TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	In another tie, Don Cheadle of ``The Rat Pack'' and veteran  
actor Gregory Peck of ``Moby Dick'' shared the award for supporting 
actor in a series, miniseries or TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won one of these in 1947 and it was very encouraging, and  
it's very encouraging now,'' Peck deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood  
Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television 
in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can 
be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she  
was announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope.'' This year she 
showed up as a presenter with toilet paper stuck to a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Globes traditionally serve as predictors for the  
Academy Awards in March. In the last 16 years, 12 films that won 
best motion picture honors at the Golden Globes went on to take the 
same prize at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.  
The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films 
trumpet their Golden Globe hauls. 
</P>
<P>
	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was  
honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his ``outstanding 
contribution to the entertainment field.'' Nicholson has been 
nominated for 14 Globes and won five. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of  
prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come 
in prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over  
allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility 
problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia 
Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly.'' Networks refused to 
show the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The association worked to regain respectability. In 1996, after  
a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers  
indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood 
studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers  
indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including 
out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than 
those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''
