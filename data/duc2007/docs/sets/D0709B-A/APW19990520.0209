<HEADLINE> Changing Cover Girls: Who Will Sell? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or  
Claudia or another fab supermodel. Still, she's so famous that the 
browser almost has to take a second look -- and may even buy the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover girl's appeal? She's a superstar, not a supermodel.  
</P>
<P>
	Fashion magazine editors are putting more famous faces from  
movies and television to music on covers, hoping the box office 
power of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore or Mariah Carey will succeed 
at newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing  
circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline. 
Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior. Ot 
they've become boring. Or even worse -- old. 
</P>
<P>
	The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power  
has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified 
six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy 
Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss. And their heirs aren't 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell  
better. Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion 
editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares 
about models anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ms. Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I sounded too harsh. It is not as dire as that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated  
by models' daily habits and ... their latest spats with their 
boyfriends or agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in  
1998, is flip-flopping those figures. Vogue increased celebrity 
covers last year from two to seven. Mademoiselle and Elle also have 
swung to star power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms.  
Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for 
spring covers. ``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover 
because I believe they will sell more. After all, that's what we're 
trying to do, sell magazines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science. Not every  
celebrity cover scores. Sometimes it's timing -- fall fashion issues 
are usually best sellers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah  
Winfrey. Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 
810,000 newsstand sales. The talk-show queen likewise reigned in 
first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November. 
</P>
<P>
	Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top  
seller for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Public personalities also are stealing the spotlight -- a Hillary  
Rodham Clinton cover on Vogue got excellent grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people  
identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior 
editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just  
broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know 
their every move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews  
known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived 
from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless 
personalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the  
transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, 
Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone. Naomi Campbell 
could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming 
``Prisoner of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always say it is my last (modeling) season because I think  
they're not going to want me anymore,'' she told Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder she worries -- the headline on her profile in the March  
issue read ``The Last Supermodel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is Ms. Campbell indeed the end of a breed?  
</P>
<P>
	About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known  
mannequins revolutionized the genre. Perhaps they were too hot not 
to cool down. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe the supermodel image just got old -- literally -- since  
most of the big names are over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on  
the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star  
models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ford would know. On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who  
racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie 
Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect at some point the celebrity tide will swing back,''  
said Elaina Richardson, editor of Elle. ``If you think about a 
Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who 
had more celebrity than most actresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the  
magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon 
Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are  
the biggest draw. Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test 
to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would 
draw more readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know which (sold more), don't you -- the strawberry  
shortcake,'' she said. ''We almost died of horror.''
