   Thornton, 45, left a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, according
to publicist Michelle Bega, who denied reports that Thornton's ill
health was due to an eating disorder.

suffered from anorexia nervosa.

movie in England to be at his side, Bega said.

intends to join Bruce Willis in a couple of weeks to work on the
film ''Bandits.''
