 &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR; , who posed last year for Playboy, appears naked
again in American Photo. The shots show Campbell's body
``glistening with water and oil,'' reports the New York Daily News,
which also notes that after pleading guilty to beating up her
assistant, the supermodel recently completed a series of anger
management sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at these photos,'' Campbell told American Photo,
``I can see that I was more at peace with myself than I had been
for a couple of years.''

   In a description of a Manhattan reading starring Harper's editor
 &UR; Lewis Lapham &LR;  and Paris Review editor  &UR; George Plimpton &LR; , the New
York Observer notes the dilemma of ``every Ivy League English major
with a fat trust fund and a tweed jacket'' in deciding which of the
literary lions to hit up for work.
</P>
<P>
   At Harper's, says the Observer, Lapham lurks around ``in his
fancy-man suits;  &UR; Colin Harrison &LR; , hubby of dirty-book writer
 &UR; Kathryn &LR; 
 &UR; Harrison &LR; , (is there) to amuse you; you have to do quite a bit of
work; when you leave, they give you a mug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Review, on the other hand, has ``George Plimpton
riding his bicycle; better cheese at the parties; no work
whatsoever; when you leave they give you an editorial assistantship
at Vanity Fair.''

   -- Hours after news of former President  &UR; Gerald Ford &LR; 's stroke
became public, ABCnews.com sent out press releases boasting that
its crew was there first, covering the story with a dozen
newshounds, ``including six reporters at the hospital alone. In an
exclusive interview with ABCnews.com, co-chairman of the GOP
 &UR; Andy Card &LR;  said that he was `terrified' when he received the
call.''

   -- Louis Vuitton will unveil a line of vanity cases designed by

rented two houses in Lenox, Mass., for the summer, one for them and
one for their chickens. ``James loves them,'' said Smedvig, who was
quoted in Fashionwiredaily.com. ``We thought we'd start with
chickens and work up to children.''

 &UR; THE HEARTBREAK OF APPEARANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- California Lawyer reports on an ordinance proposed recently
in Pleasanton that would discourage white window trim in the
Foothill Road Area and ban new houses with steep roof pitches,
stucco exteriors or more than 4,500 square feet in area. This
regulation would help ``preserve the rural aesthetic,'' the
ordinance says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine, sports commentator  &UR; John Madden &LR; 
recently bought a house in the 'hood that was built in the 1880s,
has a stucco exterior, steep pitched roof and white window trim.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR; Stacey &LR; , 29, tells Marie Claire magazine about a doomed
relationship:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met my date, the first thing he commented on was how
great my hair looked. Then, all night long, he kept complimenting
me on how straight it was, how good it looked. ... I saw the $30
blowouts as an investment. I dated him for a few months, and the
whole time, he had no idea I have curly hair. I avoided showering
at his house, we never went swimming, and we didn't go to the gym
together _ so how would he know? I was a little anxious about what
would happen when the summer came, but luckily, we broke up before
then.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Getting your lingerie in order is a fun start toward
organizing your life,'' says Real Simple magazine, which recommends
a $1,774 Stickley lingerie chest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHO SAID WHAT
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` `Praise' is an acclaimed and offbeat love story from &LR; 
 &UR; Australia. She's a nymphomaniac with a zest for Scrabble; he's a &LR; 
 &UR; chain-smoking asthmatic.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- &LR;   &LR; So what's so offbeat about that? From a press release for a
forthcoming movie.
