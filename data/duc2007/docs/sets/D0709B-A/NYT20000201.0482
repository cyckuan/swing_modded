   LOS ANGELES _ Agent 007 and a massive restructuring effort
helped drive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to its strongest quarter in a
dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MGM recorded its second consecutive profitable quarter during
the final three months of 1999, thanks to the impact of a new James
Bond flick, ``The World is Not Enough,'' improved video results and
a corporate overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Santa Monica-based MGM earned
$15.2 million, 8 cents per share, on revenues of $372.2 million.
This compares with a loss of $43.7 million, or 41cents, on revenue
of $383.4 million in the 1998 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company ended up in the red for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the year MGM lost $530.9 million, $3.36 a share, on revenue
of $1.142 billion. In 1998 the company lost $157.65 million, $2.08
a share, on sales of $1.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 loss reflects a pretax charge of $440 million to cover
restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and
chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly
performance to a variety of factors.
</P>
<P>
   One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format
with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and
overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights
previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies. The
rights were resecured without a cash outlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you exclude the performance of `The World is Not Enough' in
the fourth quarter, we still far more than doubled our ...
performance,'' Taylor said about earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based
investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc., said the actions of new
management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results moderately exceeded expectations, by about $10
million. But more importantly, there's good momentum on the deal
side,'' Harrigan said. ``It looks like they've cobbled together a
nice film slate for 2001 ... and gone a long, long way toward
changing the limited talent relationships they've had over the last
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova''
opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
</P>
<P>
   On the television side, MGM's syndicated ``National Enquirer
TV'' has just been picked up for a second season, and two new shows
are being launched: ``Sexwars'' and ``Chatroom America.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Bond film is one of the most profitable of the
decades-long franchise, collecting more than $320 million so far at
the worldwide box office. It is expected to continue to fill MGM's
coffers this year, as it is released to pay-TV and video. Three
other MGM releases _ ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Stigmata'' and
``Tea With Mussolini'' _ also performed above expectations, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM outlined a slate of 14 films for 2001. Among them are a
remake of ``Rollerball'' directed by John McTiernan, a sequel to
``Silence of the Lambs'' titled ``Hannibal'' and the sequel ``Basic
Instinct 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming
theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard
Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio
Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring
Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.
