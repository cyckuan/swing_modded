FROM SWEET TO SELFISH: GIRLS INTERPRETED

   During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage, some Life &AMP; Arts
staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the
Big Six categories: Best Picture, Best Director and the four acting
categories. We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but
there was some debate as to which award that might be. On the
official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards
take precedence over director. We decided, however, that Best
Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards. Which
is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
</P>
<P>
   The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you
realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress
nominees comprise.
</P>
<P>
   Empathy played well in this category. Toni Collette is supremely
empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The
Sixth Sense.'' It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy
recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee)
Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending. Samantha Morton
earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up
with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and
Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his
motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through
to his pain. And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always
looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a
woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once
the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the
emotions remain real.
</P>
<P>
   The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with
Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out
only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and
``Being John Malkovich.'' Jolie walks away with ``Girl,
Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature
belie a cold-hearted cruel streak. Keener was first among equals in
``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to
take advantage of just about anything _ including a passageway
inside a character actor's head.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year,
each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing
by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up
benefiting from their selflessness. And each, having risen up from
the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films
(Keener), has more familiarity than the competition. Collette and
Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier,
more versatile actress. Morton, despite having a few movies under
her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie,
and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the
edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted.''
Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for
``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt. She's my bet for who'll take home the
statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a
heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry.'' &QL;
