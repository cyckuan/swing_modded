   NEW YORK _

   &UR; Martin Margiela for Men &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For men who have hungered after the deconstructed trousers and
expert tailoring of Martin Margiela, the designer is about to
introduce a men's-wear line. It will be in stores like Barneys New
York in Manhattan and Los Angeles; Ron Herman, Fred Segal and
Maxfield's, all in Los Angeles, and Blake in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He will present the line, called 10, side by side with his
women's wear on Oct. 15 during the women's collections in Paris,
said Catherine Jiacomiai, a Margiela spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Unisex clothes have been a hallmark of Margiela's past work. The
emphasis was on pieces like T-shirts, coats and trousers that were
the same design but sized differently. ``This is really a complete
wardrobe,'' Ms. Jiacomiai said.
</P>
<P>
   The new line will be designed from scratch for men and is likely
to attract those men who wear Margiela's unisex clothes, as well as
new customers. It is consistent with the new attitude in men's wear
of sharp but soft lines promoted by designers like Raf Simons and
Alessandro Dell'Acqua, said Vincent Ehly, a men's-wear buyer for
Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Margiela's line, a large part of which is prewashed or creased
clothing, will cost about $360 for wool trousers, $120 for cotton
shirts and $185 for roomy chinos.
</P>
<P>
   As directional as Margiela's designs are, the men's line is
expected to appeal also to those in search of classic clothes.
``The women's collection is a major part of the women's store at
Barneys,'' Ehly said. ``So many women wear his tops and skirts like
basics.''

   &UR; Randolph Duke at Emmys &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The little problem of not having a business did not stand in the
way of Randolph Duke's creating clothing for the Emmy Awards show
on Sunday. Duke was in Los Angeles Monday, basking in the glow
reflected from three actresses who wore his dresses: Jane Leeves of
``Frasier,'' in an antique-green gown with paillettes and a boa;
Kim Delaney of ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' in a red matte jersey gown with
see-through insets, and Angelina Jolie of the movies ``Gia'' and
``George Wallace,'' in a nude-tone double-slip dress.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said that he did not accept a design fee for the dresses
and that he paid out of his own pocket to have them made. He
declined to say how much the custom-made gowns cost. The actresses
will not be receiving a bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was very important for me to keep up the
relationship with Hollywood, which has been very supportive,'' said
Duke, who, as the creative director of Halston until this summer,
dressed several stars, most famously Minnie Driver for this year's
Oscars ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of great relationships,'' said Duke, who is
looking for backing and talking with prospective employers. ``We
had calls from a lot of stars and stylists, and we called them,
too. I'm going forward. I have to.''

   &UR; Banana Republic Catalog  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Banana Republic is that it is fashion made simple.
But apparently not so simple that some fashion-challenged customers
don't need to have their hands held.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the company introduced a team of style consultants to
work with customers of its new catalog. Reachable by telephone at
(888) 906-2800, the consultants advise on everything from fit to
accessorizing outfits. ``There are people who do call for
figure-type information, body types and fit,'' said Sarah
Gallagher, the company's senior vice president of catalogs. ``And
some like the fashion element.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first Banana Republic catalog since 1992, toward the
end of its illustrious safari days, when it sold clothing suited to
living it up in, well, a banana republic. Along with the style
consultants have come other luxury services, like alterations and
the ability to return items to Banana Republic stores.
