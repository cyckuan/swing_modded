<HEADLINE> Drug Firm Says Diet Drug Misused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- Attorneys for American Home Products  
Corp. insist the company is not liable for the health problems of a 
woman who used the diet-drug combination fen-phen, saying she 
misused the products and was predisposed to heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Moore has sued the company for $110 million in the  
nation's first trial involving the once-popular weight-loss drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was expected to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore claims she had to quit her job because of heart valve  
damage caused by fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen combination, 
and Redux, a similar product. Both were marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home Products. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Wednesday, defense attorney Sandy Liser  
said Ms. Moore's condition is not severe and could be linked to 
other causes. The attorney said Ms. Moore has a mild and common 
disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will show she had a family history of serious heart disease  
and obesity,'' the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also plans to present testimony that fen-phen, which  
Ms. Moore took for 22 months, carried labels that recommended usage 
of no longer than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker,  
has been hit with more than 1,800 lawsuits since it pulled the 
drugs off the market in 1997 at the request of federal health 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine carried labels starting in 1988 warning that in  
rare instances it caused primary pulmonary hypertension, a 
potentially fatal disorder. The other half of the fen-phen 
combination, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems 
when taken alone and is still being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Moore said American Home Products knew fen-phen  
caused serious heart problems and underreported the number of cases 
of primary pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs were taken off the market because they were  
unreasonably dangerous,'' said attorney Michael McGartland. ``This 
should have been told to patients many years before.''
