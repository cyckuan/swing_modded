<HEADLINE> $3.75B Phen-Fen Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75  
billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people 
claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen 
diet drug combination, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will include money to pay patients who say they  
were injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for 
those who are still healthy. Pending a judge's approval, initial 
payments will begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Redux, a chemical cousin. In September 1997, the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic 
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in  
the United States, whether or not they filed suit, American Home 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement provides fair and equitable terms for both  
diet drug claimants and American Home Products,'' and allows the 
company to ``move beyond the uncertainty and distractions of 
litigation,'' said chairman John R. Stafford in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis L. Hoynes, senior vice president and general counsel,  
reiterated the company's position that the drugs were safe for most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific studies conducted to date and clinical  
experience indicate that the health of the overwhelming majority of 
people who took Redux or Pondimin has not been adversely 
affected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On news of the settlement, shares of American Home rose $3.12 1/2,  
or 7 percent, to $48.25. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,100 suits have been filed against American Home, making  
it one of the largest product liability cases ever. About six 
million people took the drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said the maximum amount available to any  
individual in the settlement is about $1.5 million, depending on 
the seriousness of their health problems, how long they took the 
drugs, their age and other medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is optional, allowing users to pursue lawsuits on  
their own. However, if American Home believes too many refuse to 
participate, it can terminate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement terms call for payments to continue for about 16  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to  
total $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A toll-free telephone number (800-386-2070) has been established  
to provide information on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers all claims except for patients who say  
they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious 
lung disorder. The company said it decided to deal with these cases 
separately because they are few in number. It also noted that 
fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could cause the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes a $2.55 billion fund to pay for  
injuries, $1 billion for medical monitoring and $200 million in 
plaintiffs attorney fees. The company has also agreed to pay $25 
million for heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement would cause it to record  
expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance 
coverage. American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last 
year and earned $2.5 billion in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only verdict yet to be rendered in any fen-phen lawsuit,  
Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas was awarded $23.3 million 
in July by a jury for heart damage she suffered after taking 
fen-phen for more than three months. Last month the company said it 
settled the case for less than 10 percent of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil trial had been under way in New Jersey over whether the  
company should be liable for the cost of medical monitoring, but 
was suspended earlier this week as the settlement appeared near.
