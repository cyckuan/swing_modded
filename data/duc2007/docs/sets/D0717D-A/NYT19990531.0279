<P>
   HOUSTON _ The nation's first full trial of a lawsuit involving
the death of a ``fen-phen'' diet drug-combination patient is to
start Tuesday in Harris County state district court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being closely watched because it could indicate
whether jurors will buy arguments that the ``fen'' part of the
combination could cause serious heart disease leading to death, as
well as how much jurors might award in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have declined to comment, saying state District Judge
Katie Kennedy did not want them to discuss the trial before opening
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with litigation over the diet drugs have said
several fen-phen death cases in the country have been settled for
about $4 million to $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer of the ``fen'' drug, American Home Products of
Madison, N.J., met recently with lawyers in New York and Houston to
discuss a possible settlement of the potentially tens of thousands
of fen-phen cases nationwide. A jury verdict in this case could
significantly impact such a settlement, lawyers have said.
</P>
<P>
   No figures have been discussed in the settlement talks, lawyers
have said, but any such settlement would easily exceed the drug
company's $1 billion insurance liability limit for fen-related
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled ``fen'' from the
market Sept. 15, 1997, citing evidence it may have irreversibly,
and sometimes fatally, scarred users' heart valves. An estimated
6.6 million people have used the diet drug combination.
</P>
<P>
   No jury has ruled on any fen-phen cases. A case in Cleburne,
Texas, was the first to reach trial in the country, but it was
settled April 8, before American Home Products started presenting
its case. Although the settlement was supposed to be confidential,
it was reported to be $500,000. That case did not involve a death.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the Houston-area case are the survivors of
Mary Marisa Smith, who died allegedly of primary pulmonary
hypertension as a result of taking ``fen'' under the marketed name
of ``Pondimin.'' The lawsuit does not say when Smith died or her
age, only that she had a life expectancy of at least 50 more years.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are her husband, two children and two parents,
all of Harris County, which includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They are seeking unspecified damages from American Home
Products, Dr. Leo Borrell, who prescribed the drug, and the M.D.
Managed Weight Care clinic in Clear Lake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also name the manufacturers of the ``phen'' part
of the combination, but a panel of state district judges has ruled
that those manufacturers are not liable.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the defendants had ample knowledge before
FDA's withdrawal that the drugs could cause serious heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   All defendants have denied wrongdoing in court documents, saying
evidence linking the drug to the disease is inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fen'' part of the drug combination was manufactured by a
division of American Home Products, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia. Two versions were marketed _ fenfluramine, sold as
Pondimin, and a purer version of the compound known as
dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of
the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, primarily
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass. No studies linked
this drug with the heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, phentermine manufacturers were also sued in Harris
County because they allegedly marketed phentermine to prolong the
usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual 12 weeks to six
months. Phentermine manufacturers have been dismissed from most, if
not all, suits around the country.
