<HEADLINE> Another Diet Drug Trial Underway </HEADLINE>

	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began Monday in the trial of  
a Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for 
damaging her heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Stone Lovett of Grand Saline is suing American Home  
Products Inc. and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Also named 
are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the 
prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is claiming she suffered moderate to severe heart  
valve damage after taking fen-phen for eight months starting in 
October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline, Texas, and Wal-Mart  
Stores, where the prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff said he will prove that American  
Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed 
to put warnings on drug labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and  
detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said. ``By 
the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart 
disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to  
comment on the lawsuit. The Madison, N.J.-based company is the 
nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Several are class-action suits 
asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future 
treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court  
over heart-valve damage. Sandra Moore settled for a reported 
$500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed  
but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental  
anguish and seeking unspecified damages. Petroff said the 
36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was 
hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she  
took the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market  
in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. A Mayo 
Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
