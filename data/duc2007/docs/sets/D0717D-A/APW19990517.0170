<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared in Fen-Phen Trial </HEADLINE>

	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A Texas woman who blames the maker of diet  
drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves will try again to have 
her day in court. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Monday declared a mistrial after attorneys determined  
they couldn't seat an impartial jury to hear Debbie Stone Lovett's 
case against American Home Products Inc. and subsidiary, 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many people had their mind made up that fen-phen was  
dangerous,'' said Kip Petroff, an attorney representing Ms. Lovett. 
He said lawyers were in the midst of questioning 62 prospective 
jurors when they decided they couldn't find an impartial panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several prospective jurors in Van Zandt County said they had  
relatives who took fen-phen and would feel uncomfortable hearing 
the case, The Dallas Morning News reported. Others, the newspaper 
said, said Ms. Lovett was responsible for her injuries because she 
continues to smoke a half-pack of cigarettes a day despite the 
known health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said District Judge Tommy Wallace had set July 12 as a  
date for a retrial, where a larger pool of prospective jurors would 
be called. A hearing was scheduled for this morning to consider 
consolidating the case with another similar lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lovett's case goes forward, Petroff said, he will prove  
that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve 
damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and  
detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said. ``By 
the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart 
disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to  
comment on the lawsuit. The Madison, N.J.-based company is the 
nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named in Lovett's suit are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and  
Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Several are class-action suits 
asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future 
treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court  
over heart-valve damage. Sandra Moore settled for a reported 
$500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed  
but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental  
anguish and seeking unspecified damages. Petroff said the 
36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was 
hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she  
took the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market  
in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. A Mayo 
Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
