<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Case Settled for $23M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- A Texas woman who blamed the diet drug  
combination fen-phen for her heart damage has agreed to settle a 
lawsuit against the manufacturer for a fraction of the $23.3 
million a jury awarded her. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the settlement Thursday came on the same day as reports  
that the company -- American Home Products Corp. -- is close to 
settling most of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against 
it for at least $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Texas case, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, blamed  
American Home and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for damage 
she suffered after taking fen-phen for more than three months 
starting in October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff would not disclose the amount  
of the settlement, but said the deal was reached after considering 
state law that caps monetary awards in civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of the settlement was significantly less than the  
amount of the verdict, but the amount of the settlement is more 
than 90 percent of what we thought would be awarded after all of 
the evidence was considered and after the statutory cap on punitive 
damages was applied as required by law,'' Petroff said. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP spokesman Doug Petkus went a bit further in discussing the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the amount is confidential, American Home Products can  
confirm it totaled less than 10 percent of the amount returned by 
the jury,'' Petkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fen-phen cases have been filed across the nation,  
but Ms. Lovett's lawsuit was the first to reach a jury. Jurors last 
month found the company was fully liable for Ms. Lovett's ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products marketed Pondimin and Redux until  
September 1997. That was when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the 
drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it in combination with 
another drug, phentermine. When taken alone, phentermine never was 
associated with health problems. It remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the larger settlement, two newspapers reported Thursday  
that final details were being worked out and the deal could be 
announced as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger of Newark said the settlement could exceed $5  
billion, and would resolve more than 4,100 lawsuits brought by 
8,000 people. The Wall Street Journal said the settlement would be 
about $3 billion. Both reports cited anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home officials refused to comment on the possibility of  
a wide-ranging settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger reported that the company's offer includes  
payments to patients harmed by the diet drugs, along with follow-up 
medical examinations for millions of other users. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said those who feel the agreement is inadequate  
could opt out and pursue cases on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger said unresolved issues on Wednesday included the  
structure of the payout and the terms of a side deal with 
plaintiffs in New Jersey, where a civil trial is under way over 
whether the Madison N.J.-based drug maker should be liable for the 
cost of future medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending settlement would cover individual lawsuits and  
class-action suits certified in eight states, the newspaper said. 
It would need a federal judge's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether  
the American Home revealed all it knew about dangers of Redux prior 
to its approval by the government in 1996. The company denied 
knowing about any such inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's stock has languished in recent months largely  
due to uncertainty about how much it will have to pay to resolve 
the diet drug lawsuits.
