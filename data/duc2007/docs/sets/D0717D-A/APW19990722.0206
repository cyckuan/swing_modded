<HEADLINE> Report: Fen-phen Maker Settles Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. has reportedly paid  
more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman 
that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination 
fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement in Ruth Burks' case, reported Thursday by the  
Dallas Morning News, is at least the 12th settlement by the 
pharmaceutical giant involving former users of fen-phen. The drug 
maker, based in Madison, N.J., faces more than 3,100 lawsuits 
nationwide related to health problems allegedly caused by its 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Home Products spokesman could not immediately be  
reached by The Associated Press Thursday for comment. Mrs. Burks' 
lawyer, C.L. Mike Schmidt of Dallas, confirmed the settlement's 
existence to the Morning News but refused to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products marketed fenfluramine and its chemical  
cousin dexfenfluramine until September 1997, when the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration pushed for the drugs' withdrawal. Phentermine, 
the other drug used in the fen-phen combination, was not pulled 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the settlement was more than $3 million,  
citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burks settlement comes less than a month after American Home  
Products agreed to pay between $6 million and $7 million to settle 
a Harris County lawsuit linking a woman's death to fen-phen. The 
trial was the nation's first involving a patient who died after 
taking the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burks took fen-phen from April 1996 to July 1997. Doctors  
diagnosed her with primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially 
fatal lung disease, in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burks now lives in an assisted-living center in Tyler and  
receives medication intravenously through a chest catheter.
