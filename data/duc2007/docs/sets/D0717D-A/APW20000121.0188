<HEADLINE> Another Fen-Phen Drug Suit Filed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MACON, Miss. (AP) -- On the heels a successful damage suit trial in Fayette
against fen-phen maker American Home Products, attorneys are again turning to a
Mississippi court with claims of health damage caused by the diet drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest legal action was filed with Noxubee County Circuit Court on
behalf of six women.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit comes only four weeks after a Jefferson County jury awarded about
$400 million to plaintiffs who made similar claims against American Home
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Wilbur O. Colom of Columbus said the latest lawsuit seeks a larger
award, which he said should send diet pill manufacturers a strong message.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe we can produce a multibillion verdict in Noxebee County," Colom
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home, pharmaceutical companies Wyeth-Ayerst and SmithKline Beecham
and Savon Drug Stores are among the 12 defendants named in the new lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Colom said a trial date would be set for some time in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Colom said his firm and partners in an Alabama law firm plan additional diet
drug suits in Mississippi, including in Jefferson, Holmes and Claiborne
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical relative
called Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   About 6 million people took the mix of fenfluramine and phentermine after it
came out in the mid-1990s. American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the
market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal
heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home agreed earlier this year to pay up to $4.83 billion in a
settlement that could cover all 6 million users. The deal would pay claimants
anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1.5 million, though thousands of suits
remain.
