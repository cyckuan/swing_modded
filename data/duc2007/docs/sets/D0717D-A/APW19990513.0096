<HEADLINE> Talks Held in Fen-Phen Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The manufacturer of the diet drug combination  
fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by 
people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and 
often-fatal lung problems, lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with pharmaceutical giant American Home Products  
Corp. began several weeks ago, but talks are still too preliminary 
to put a price tag on a possible settlement, Houston lawyer Graham 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how any lawyer on the plaintiffs' side at this  
point could say what it would take to settle all the cases,'' said 
Hill, whose firm represents 100 people who say they developed 
health problems after using fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	James Peterson, another plaintiff's lawyer, said the drug  
company initiated the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the possibility of  
a national agreement Thursday, said American Home would pay 
billions of dollars under such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for American Home, the world's seventh-largest  
pharmaceutical company, declined comment. A trial is scheduled 
later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, American Home reached a settlement in the first  
trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen. The company reportedly 
agreed to a $500,000 settlement to one plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against  
fen-phen, and class-action lawsuits asking the company to pay for 
medical checkups and future medical treatments have been certified 
in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary,  
marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- and 
Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux  
off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides met Wednesday in Houston, Hill said.  
Other meetings have occurred over the past two weeks in 
Philadelphia and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible settlement of the class-action cases could involve  
American Home paying for medical examinations of fen-phen users who 
have not yet reported health problems, Hill said. It has not yet 
been decided whether those diagnosed with problems would be 
eligible for damages.
