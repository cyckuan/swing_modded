<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Settlement Hearings Begin  </HEADLINE>

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion
national settlement of health claims against the diet drug
combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge
began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle, who gave preliminary
approval to the deal in November, is expected to decide at the end
of the two-week hearing whether the settlement will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Blizzard, an attorney for a group of fen-phen users
who object to the settlement, wants the judge to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is illegal and unfair,'' Blizzard said Tuesday. ''The
amounts being offered to settle these claims are inadequate to
compensate people for their injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's maker, American Home Products, and plaintiffs'
attorneys who worked out the settlement last October favor its
approval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Madison,
N.J.-based American Home, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the
fen-phen combination. The company sold the drug under the brand
name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart
valve damage. The second drug in the combination, phentermine, was
not linked to the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the fen-phen users would get a maximum of
$1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their
level of injury and how long they took the drugs. The settlement
also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement is the result of a dedicated effort between
plaintiffs' attorneys and American Home Products to create a
comprehensive and equitable plan,'' said Louis L. Hoynes Jr.,
American Home's senior vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, 45,000 refused the settlement and retain the right to
sue for punitive damages. Those who remained in the class action
may still reject the settlement and sue for compensatory damages
but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.
