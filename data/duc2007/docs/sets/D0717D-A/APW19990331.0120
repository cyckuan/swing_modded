	CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- A company hid evidence that half of the  
popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart 
problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp. 
for $110 million said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is believed to be the first to reach a courtroom  
over the issue of heart valve damage caused by fen-phen or Redux, 
and experts said a victory for the woman could prove key to other 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-member jury was seated to hear the case, filed by Sandra  
Moore against American Home Products Corp., the parent of 
pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales and marketing people said if you put a black box  
warning on this product you are going to see sales of the product 
cut in half,'' Michael McGartland said during opening statements of 
the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were making a lot of money,'' he said. ``It doesn't take  
a rocket scientist to figure out what the motivation was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moore, a former Alvarado resident who now lives in Missoula,  
Mont., claims she wasn't warned about the risks of taking 
fenfluramine, marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin, or 
dexfenfluramine, a similar drug sold by the company as Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenflurmaine and Redux have been taken off the market.  
Fenfluramine makes up half of the ``fen-phen'' combination 
prescribed to thousands of patients to promote weight loss. The 
other half, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when 
taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Bill Sims said he looks forward to putting the  
facts before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of misinformation circulating about these drugs  
and why they were voluntarily withdrawn from the market,'' he said. 
``We are going to tell it like it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors found mild heart valve damage after Ms. Moore, 52, took  
fen-phen for 10 months in 1996. She is now on medication for her 
condition.
