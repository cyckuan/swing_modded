STUDY: CONSERVATION PLANS OFTEN BASED ON SHAKY SCIENCE,
UNCERTAINTY

<P>
   The Clinton Administration's trademark new approach to enforcing
the Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands
has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
</P>
<P>
   The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with
National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific
weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the
administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing
species protected by the Act.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal
government. They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log _ or
otherwise use _ their property. In return, the landowners agree to
make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered
plants or animals.
</P>
<P>
   The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is
enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and
they're spreading rapidly. The areas covered by the habitat
conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of
gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded
woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as
``innovative'' and ``helpful.'' He said it is spurring his agency
to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack
scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk
species. Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or
animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species'
survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the
species actually fare, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific
data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of
the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close
to a guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of
private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat,
to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   And large landowners, especially timber companies in the
Northwest, have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans. They
have negotiated or are working on agreements that would effect
about 11 million acres in Washington, Oregon California, Idaho and
Montana. That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial
timberland in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the plans have drawn mounting criticism from
environmental groups and some conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the new study, obtained by the Post-Intelligencer,
supported some of those complaints. It found:
</P>
<P>
   _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals
killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about
two-thirds of the species covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the
species' survival was ``especially common.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the
improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is
practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
</P>
<P>
   _ Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring
programs that were sufficient for evaluating success.''
</P>
<P>
   _ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat
is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what
cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100
years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked,
without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide
adequate species protection.
</P>
<P>
   Laverne Smith, chief of Interior's Division of Endangered
Species, declined to respond to any of the draft's specific
criticisms. She said a formal response is being drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which eclipses previous habitat planning reviews in
both depth and scope, was coordinated by the National Center for
Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California
at Santa Barbara with financial assistance from the National
Science Foundation and the American Institute for Biological
Sciences. The scientists from eight universities evaluated 208 of
227 habitat plans, with an in-depth look at 43 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Though still subject to revisions, the draft study expands on
findings reported in December. At that time, Peter Kareiva, the
University of Washington ecologist who supervised the study, said,
``There are a huge number of Habitat Conservatin Plans (HCPs) that
probably should not have been written.'' Kareiva could not be
reached for comment on the latest version of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced in February it intends to improve HCP
guidelines. Interior Department officials have been working on
language to require plans to have clear monitoring programs,
measurable biological goals and more public review. And, where
information is lacking, the government is seeking shorter duration
and more clauses that would force landowners to tighten safeguards
if new species problems developed.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as
necessary growing pains for a new program. ``Obviously, this stuff
is all new and we're cutting it out of whole cloth,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a couple hundred HCPs. Now, what we have to do is go
back and look at all of them and see if there are lessons we can
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials noted that the plans cannot be delayed for
perfect data and are negotiated compromises, not pure science.
</P>
<P>
   The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters. In
1996, 167 scientists complained about the plans' lack of
independent scientific review and warned they ``have the potential
to become habitat giveaways that contribute to, rather than
alleviate, threats to listed species and their habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Several environmental groups and members of congress have also
raised concerns. ``Giving it all away'' is what a coalition of
Northwest environmental groups last year called a review of the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception to the environmental group critics is
Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund, a highly regarded
expert on on U.S. wildlife law. Bean agrees that some of the plans
are ``lousy,'' but says they can produce net gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``HCPs have the potential to produce results that are far better
than we could otherwise expect,'' he said, especially where human
intervention is needed to restore habitat or combat an invasive
exotic species.
