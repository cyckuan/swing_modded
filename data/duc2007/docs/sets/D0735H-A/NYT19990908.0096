   OTTAWA _ In the United States, the gray wolf is a protected
species, guarded by tough federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the creature is vermin. Hunters are free to blast
away at the beasts on whim, and they do.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, US game biologists using radio collars to track
gray wolves in Montana were horrified when a trio of females loped
across the line to establish dens in Alberta. Each found a mate,
gave birth to cubs, and settled in. Within 16 months, all of the
female wolves, their offspring, and their mates had been killed by
Canadian ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are commonplace along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Among international wildlife groups, Canada is notorious for its
failure to pass a federal endangered species law similar to one
enacted in the United States more than a quarter-century ago.
Mexico has broad federal protections for threatened species,
leaving Canada as North America's wildlife renegade.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the pressure, both domestically and from abroad, the
country's new environmental minister, David Anderson, pledged last
month to push for strong legislation that will place special
emphasis on guarding breeding and ranging habitat, such as forest,
wetlands, prairies, and coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has been down this road before. Although Anderson is
personally respected by environmentalists, there is cynicism as to
whether a federal government that has shown a historic
unwillingness to confront the issue can buck opposition from the
country's extremely powerful forestry, mining, and agricultural
industries _ as well as from provincial legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot get our act together in this country on the
most fundamental of problems,'' said David Schindler, a renowned
wildlife biologist and profesor of ecology at the University of
Alberta. ``Far be it from Canada to stop loggers or miners or
farmers from the innocent pursuit of destroying our natural
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so vast and pristine that many of its citizens have
difficulty comprehending that hundreds of native animal and plant
species are in genuine danger, Canadian environmentalists find
themselves fighting battles that their American counterparts won a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon brought in a darned good law in the US, and
Pierre Trudeau refused,'' said Elizabeth May, executive director of
the Canadian branch of the Sierra Club, referring to the former
Canadian prime minister. ``That's been the story ever since. Mexico
can do it, Australia can do it, but good, green Canada can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, more than 600 scientists from Canadian
universities, research centers, and even the government's own
wildlife agencies signed a strongly worded letter to Prime Minister
Jean Chretien imploring federal Parliament to enact meaningful
endangered species legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada's endangered species are too imperiled, too close to
extinction, and too precious to be held hostage to lobbyists,
political manipulation, or simple ignorance,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like the gray wolf, opponents of a federal species law
argue that the animal may be endangered in the United States, but
healthy populations survive in Canada and do not deserve rigorous
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzly bear, abundant in Alberta and British Columbia only
a decade ago, is now in decline, according to many wildlife
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grizzly is going down rapidly in Alberta,'' said
Schindler. ``Mainly because of huge intrusion into habitat by
logging, oil, and gas companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wolves are having problems. In the Bow Valley of Banff
National Park, one of the most famous symbols of Canada's raw
beauty, not a single successful litter of wolves survived this
year; all of the young creatures were killed by cars or met other
misfortune from humans.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has 339 species in serious danger of disappearing,
according to wildlife experts, from the Peary caribou to the piping
plover. The federal government lists these animals and plants as
endangered but has no broad laws to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the creatures, such as the northern cricket frog or the
Eskimo curlew _ an Arctic bird _ haven't been seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Others, from the Vancouver Island marmot on Canada's far west
coast to the American marten in Newfoundland, on the country's
easternmost edge, are down to a few hundred animals.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, there are often local regulations or
provincial laws to guard Canada's threatened animals or plants
against hunters or trappers, or _ in the case of plants and insects
_ against harvesters and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such laws are often toothless, and that the real
danger to most Canadian wildlife is not the hunter's bullet but the
developer's bulldozer, the logger's chainsaw, and the farmer's
pesticides and plow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is habitat, not the individual animal,'' said
Lindsay Rodger, species recovery manager for World Wildlife
Fund-Canada. ``If we can't protect the spaces where endangered
animals live and breed, we can't protect the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still open season on almost any creature in the provinces
that have no endangered species laws, such as British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. ``Canadians love peregrine
falcons,'' one leading environmentalist joked darkly. ``They taste
as good as bald eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   In provinces with such laws, protections amount to no more than
legal lip service. Ontario, the most populous province _ where
species such as the Acadian flycatcher, aurora trout, and Lake Erie
water snake cling to the edge of survival _ has brought
prosecutions only five times in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Prince Edward Island, warning signs and fences skirt the sand
dunes that provide nesting grounds for the piping plover, a
melodious shore bird fast disappearing from its widely scattered
breeding ranges. But bicyclists, hikers, and other beachgoers at
spectacular Cavendish National Park regularly intrude on the grassy
knolls. Park officials claim to be helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the only authority we have is to put up signs
saying it's bad to hurt the birds,'' said one uniformed ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a bigger threat comes from mining, forestry, and the
petroleum industry, which are mainstays of the economy, especially
in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, these industries have discovered a public relations
problem related to habitat destruction _ something most American
natural resources companies recognized decades ago. But logging and
mining outfits insist they cannot afford to support a federal
endangered species act unless they get compensation. Farmers also
want federal paybacks for not plowing under habitat, a demand that
gets more sympathy from environmentalists than from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial governments insist that land management falls under
their jurisdiction, and that federal protection for wildlife
represents a slap against Canadian-style home rule.
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious problem, but one cited repeatedly by wildlife
experts, is psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is so vast and so relatively unspoiled that environmental
protection has never carried the sense of public urgency that it
does in the United States or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Canada is frozen barrens or tundra, as inhospitable to
most animals and plants as to humans. Most, although not all, of
the country's seriously endangered species inhabit the
200-mile-wide band along the US border that is also home to most of
Canada's cities, factories, and farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, Canadians are blinded by the country's amazing
natural riches,'' Schindler said. ``It's hard to recognize the
slippage. But all the dangers are there.''
