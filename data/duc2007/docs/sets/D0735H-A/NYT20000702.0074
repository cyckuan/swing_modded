<P>
   The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray
wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of
existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few
places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection
afforded the country's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service plans this month to propose
dropping the wolf a significant notch under the Endangered Species
Act, from endangered to threatened, in all but a small part of its
range.
</P>
<P>
   The change would mean that, in most areas, wolves that kill
livestock or otherwise pose a threat to human affairs could be
chased away or shot by government agents.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents the first step toward eventually turning over
management of the species, Canis lupus, in many places to state
wildlife agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Just about anything having to do with the wolf, which has been
both reviled and revered through much of human history, generates
fierce debate, and the proposed change in its status is no
different.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservation groups say the forthcoming plan would relax
protections too soon and would declare victory before wolves have
recolonized broad parts of their old range. Many ranchers and
conservative private groups, though, say the laws shielding wolves
wrongly limit property owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials acknowledge that, in part, the proposed
change _ by allowing shooting of livestock raiders _ is intended to
assuage opponents of wolf restoration, including ranchers and their
allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But they argue that the relaxation of rules would be a net
benefit for the species by diminishing the tendency of frustrated
property owners to resort to illegal, uncontrolled killing of
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed
change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf,
although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this
country, constitutes an important ecological success story _ like
that of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle
before it.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in
1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed _ almost all of
them in Minnesota or Michigan. Now more than 3,500 animals roam
parts of eight states. Thousands more live in Alaska, Canada and
parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the next decade, will not be how to save the
wolf, but rather how best to manage the animal,'' according to a
recent status report written by Dr. L. David Mech, a biologist for
the U.S. Geological Survey and a leading wolf expert.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, conservation and property rights groups,
ranchers and wildlife watchers still heatedly debate the possible
reintroduction of a predator that is a first cousin of man's best
friend but also is an age-old antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning
the reintroduction of wolves. Oregon's congressional delegation has
repeatedly introduced language that would limit wolf protections or
bar even the natural migration of wolves from adjacent states.
</P>
<P>
   Two wolves wandered into Oregon in the last year from
experimental packs transplanted into central Idaho. One was
captured and sent home by federal officials and the other was
killed by a car. Environmental groups hailed the dispersing wolves
as pioneers returning the call of the wild to the state after a
50-year absence. Ranching groups said the state was well rid of
them and did not need them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have excessive numbers of cougars, coyotes and bears that
take a heavy toll on the other wildlife and livestock and we simply
cannot add another predator,'' said Sharon Beck, a past president
of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   But in some places, there are signs that wolves are becoming an
accepted feature of the landscape outside of parks and preserves,
and conflicts are shifting from whether they should be there to how
they should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   Some Montana ranchers have figured out high-tech ways of driving
them away instead of resorting to high-powered rifles and a
strategy popularly known as ``shoot, shovel and shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   On his 4,000-acre ranch in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, Tom
Ruffatto recently installed loud alarms that are triggered by the
radio tracking collars used to monitor most of the area's wolf
packs.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffatto's project was partly paid for by Defenders of Wildlife,
a private group that also writes checks to cover livestock losses
from wolf attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan, wolves are so
abundant _ some have dens just 50 miles from Minneapolis _ that
they could theoretically be removed entirely from the endangered
list. The only impediment lies in Minnesota, which has yet to
follow the other two states and create its own wolf management
program _ a prerequisite if federal protection is to be ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what is done in Minnesota, there's no way of
threatening the wolf there anymore,'' said Mech (pronounced MEECH).
``I can't conceive of anything, excluding poison, that would
endanger this population.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves
would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare
subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have
circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and
others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for
changes and girding for hearings and _ inevitably _ lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is formally released, the proposed classification change
will be the subject of four months of public comment _ twice the
required length _ and eight months of internal discussions and
possible changes before it becomes a rule.

<P>
   The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to
broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and
the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act includes much flexibility on this
point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species'
original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
</P>
<P>
   A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by
someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials at the
agency said that almost all of the draft's major points would be
reflected in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be
divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
</P>
<P>
   The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota. The western
region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah,
Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain
endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Maine. Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in
100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine,
which is considered the likeliest spot for any future
reintroduction effort.
</P>
<P>
   But federal wildlife officials said they were not even sure what
kind of wolves inhabited the Northeast, with some genetic studies
suggesting that they were red wolves, a different species
altogether. In part because of those questions, no recovery effort
is likely in the Northeast for many years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the contiguous states, the proposal says, wolves
are never likely to be seen again, and thus in these areas _ 30
states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely,
leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the impending plan is particularly acute in
Colorado, where private wildlife groups have banded together into a
coalition aimed at trying to replicate in the southern Rockies the
successes with wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park and
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Arapkiles, a regional representative for the Sierra Club in
Boulder, Colo., said the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to
wrap things up before the job was done. ``Their own studies said
that over 1,000 wolves could exist in 11 of the national forests in
Colorado alone,'' Arapkiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Private land owners, including Ted Turner, the media tycoon,
have offered expansive tracts of land, rich in elk and other prey,
that could serve as wolf habitat, she added. ``To ignore that kind
of potential is foolhardy,'' Arapkiles said.
</P>
<P>
   But federal wildlife officials are standing by their
conclusions, saying that the federal list of endangered species is
the ecological equivalent of a hospital's intensive care unit, and
that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Refsnider, a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in
Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal, said
there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living
in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape,''
Refsnider said, referring to areas along the Mexican border that
could support the Mexican subspecies. Right now, he said, fewer
than two dozen wolves roam there.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of
wolves, he said, would come at the expense of other species that
might be just as important ecologically, but that do not have the
mystique and high profile of a legendary predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention that the act should be providing
long-term care for these species,'' Refsnider said. ``The intent is
to pull them back from the brink for the foreseeable future and
turn them over to normal management agencies. And that's what we're
proposing.''
