<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt called a decision last
week by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ``a ringing
endorsement of our wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone
National Park and central Idaho.'' Many farmers and ranchers in the
affected regions had hoped that a 2-year-old federal district
court's decision to dismantle the program would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt regards the Jan. 13 appeals court decision overruling
the lower federal court as ``a welcome vindication of our efforts
to preserve this magnificent species.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Judge William Downes of the U.S. District
Court of the District of Wyoming ruled that the U.S. Fish &AMP;
Wildlife Service, as an agency of the Department of the Interior,
had violated the Endangered Species Act and the intent of Congress
with its wolf recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in
Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an ``experimental and
nonessential'' wolf population, which means they lost much of the
protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species
Act. Any stray wolves already in the regions or who migrate there
also lose the protective shield that the law provides.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 to ``provide
for the conservation, protection, restoration, and propagation of
species of fish, wildlife, and plants facing extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, the Department of the Interior is not allowed to
introduce an experimental population of an endangered species in
the same geographical area where there is already an existing
population of the same species. Part of the lower federal court's
decision pivoted on the term ``population.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolves do wander through Yellowstone and central Idaho. However,
do stragglers or wolves traveling with mates constitute a
population?
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service issued its Final
Environmental Impact Statement on the wolf reintroduction plan. It
stated: ``Scientific evidence does not indicate that any population
of wolves persisted or currently exists in the Yellowstone or
central Idaho areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling, Downes equates individual wolves with
naturally occurring populations. He asserts that ``Congress has
stated the `experimental population' cannot include naturally
occurring wolves. ... The introduction of an experimental
population cannot operate as a de facto `delisting' of naturally
occurring wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Downes concludes that the Department of the Interior's ``blanket
treatment of all wolves found within the designated experimental
population areas as experimental animals is contrary to law.'' The
judge's decision set aside the wolf recovery plan and ordered all
the introduced wolves and their offspring removed from Yellowstone
and central Idaho. Recognizing the importance and the ramifications
of his ruling, Downes imposed a stay on his judgment pending an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals had little patience with
Downes' legal reasoning. It pounced on the soft spot in his
analysis like Dracula on a jugular vein.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court begins with basic separation of powers
tradition: If Congress has clearly spoken to a national public
policy issue, then unless Congress has taken an unconstitutional
position, a federal court bows to its authority. If Congress is
silent on the issue and has delegated authority over the matter to
a lawful federal agency, then the court defers to the agency's
interpretation _ unless that is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the Endangered Species Act, Congress did not define the term
``population''; therefore, the appellate court reasoned, ``Congress
deliberately left the resolution of this type of
management/conservation issue to the Department (of the
Interior).''
</P>
<P>
   And federal wildlife biologists define a wolf ``population'' as
at least two wild breeding pairs that raise at least two young in
an area for the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that a naturally occurring wolf population
existed in Yellowstone or central Idaho prior to the introduction
of the gray wolves. Therefore, concluded the appellate court, on
that question, the Department of the Interior did not violate the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court wasted little time on the issue of ``de
facto `delisting''' of wolves already in the area, which Downes
found in violation of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court wrote: ``We believe this holding
unnecessarily limits the administrative discretion and flexibility
Congress intentionally incorporated into section 10(j) (of the
ESA), ignores biological reality, and misconstrues the larger
purposes of the Endangered Species Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The court explains further: ``It is not difficult to imagine
that sound population management practices tailored to the
biological circumstances of a particular species could facilitate a
more effective and efficient species-wide recovery, even if the
process renders some individual animals more vulnerable. ...
Congress left such decisions to the department. We conclude the
department reasonably exercised its management authority.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that the U.S. Supreme Court will grant an
appeal, even if one were requested. There is no conflict among
federal appeals courts concerning the legality of the wolf
reintroduction program.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf
reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife
recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy. This decision is
a significant step toward saving our endangered species and
maintaining the diversity of our wildlife.
