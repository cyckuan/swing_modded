   (UNDATED) _ Under crystal skies, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt carried two burdens Monday into the pine-studded forests of
eastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   One was a heavy steel cage. Inside was one of two endangered
Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and
Gila national forests.
</P>
<P>
   The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have
gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the
first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he
took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of
the Southwest in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this (wolf)
as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be
decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
</P>
<P>
   A reward of $30,000 is posted for information leading to the
arrest of the wolf killers.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in
prison and a $100,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to
increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in
danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest
ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are
kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal
law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he
promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the
killer or killers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   And he promised to return again this winter, when four
additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a
multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves
scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land
along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal
investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first
wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker
Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents. But when pressed
for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just
rather not comment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The interior secretary, who heads the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of
his family was under attack. And he said it remains true that there
is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this
century ever attacking a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the facts support any inference that the wolf
was anything other than an animal that happened to be in the
neighborhood,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   G.J. of Tucson, a hunting enthusiast who has acted as a
spokesman for Humphrey, said he believes it is possible that the
three wolves shot in August, October and earlier this month may
also have been killed legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the
wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in
after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former
editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News.'' Sagi said he closed
shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sagi said whoever killed the wolves recently should
consult an attorney and turn themselves in to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a series of accidents or deliberate sabotage, one
thing is for sure: The recent killings are a monolithic catastrophe
in the effort to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf, and speak
volumes about the need for coalition building in this and any
federal effort that potentially impacts recreation and property
rights,'' Sagi said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with
the local community.
