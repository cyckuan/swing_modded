   DENVER _ The rapid beeping of a radio collar on the yearling
male wolf a few weeks ago signaled the end of Mexican gray wolves
in the wild _ for now, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission from the collar indicated that the wolf had
stopped moving, and trackers found it dead several days later near
the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona. It was the
fifth rare Mexican gray wolf found dead, apparently from a gunshot,
since 11 of the animals were released into the wild in a recovery
program last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Mexican wolves free in the wild today,'' said Tom
Bauer, assistant regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's
Southwest Office in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 wolves released in this inaugural year of the recovery
program, five have been killed, one is missing and presumed dead,
and five have been returned to captivity for breeding in
acclimation pens near Alpine, Ariz. One pup born in the wild is
missing and presumed dead since his mother was shot in August. One
shooting in April was accounted for when a camper said he mistook
the wolf for a coyote that was endangering his family. Necropsy
reports are expected to determine the cause of death of the other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest killing was reported, there has been talk of a
conspiracy to eliminate the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Kaufman, regional director of the wildlife office,
said, ``We really don't have, despite what people want to think,
evidence of a conspiracy to kill the wolves. These killings have
sabotaged the program, they have set the program back
substantially. However, we are going forward with the program, and
reviewing our techniques and adding law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albuquerque Journal reported that a wildlife activist had
met with an Arizona prisoner who said he had been offered $35,000
by a New Mexico rancher to kill all wolves reintroduced into the
wild. Wildlife activists say it has not been uncommon in the
Southwest for ranchers to offer a bounty for predators such as
mountain lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any rancher that's got the time or the money to
do this if somebody was that misguided,'' said Caren Cowan,
executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
``A radical environmental group accused livestock owners of getting
a fund for a bounty to do this, and well, it's laughable. We in no
way condone the needless and senseless shooting of animals for any
reason, and no, we don't know who's doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowan said her organization is one a handful that has
pursued legal avenues to stop the reintroduction of the wolves, and
admitted the wolves had not been as problematic as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the big, bad wolf the ranchers make them out to
be,'' said Shane Jimerfield, assistant director of the Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz. ``The wolves have
exceeded all expectations of recovery, the only problem they are
having is with humans, not the natural environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimerfield said a reward of $35,000 has been offered by wildlife
organizations and the government for information leading to the
arrest of whoever is killing the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mexican gray wolf, or ``lobo,'' as it is regionally
known, is an endangered species, the punishment for killing one is
a $100,000 fine and up to six months in prison. Ranchers brought
the animals to extinction around the end of the 18th century and
beginning of the 19th century. In the past decade, two sub-species
of gray wolf have been reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park
and wilderness areas of Idaho.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinapu, a group in Boulder, Colo., that supports reintroducing
wolves into the wild, filed a notice of intent Tuesday to sue
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and his successor, state Treasurer Bill
Owens, over a longstanding statewide bounty of $2 on gray wolves
that has never been rescinded in spite of the animal's federal
status as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notice letter underscores the fact that Colorado's bounty
presents a political impediment to wolf restoration in the
region,'' said Rob Edwards, the group's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt went to the remote
Gila National Forest on the border of New Mexico and Arizona to
show support for the recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Babbitt said, ``We are committed to the
recovery of the Mexican wolf and the goals of the Endangered
Species Act.''
