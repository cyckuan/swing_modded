<P>
   Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf
in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were
brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wolf death has environmentalists calling for FBI
intervention, while some ranchers say now is a good time to abandon
the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the
latest killing ``incomprehensible,'' and she repeated Babbitt's vow
last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of
returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next
decade _ will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are allegations that a $35,000 bounty has been
posted for the wolves' slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that is the same amount the federal government
and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the
arrest of the wolf killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there are only four wolves remaining in the wild, and
none is running free.
</P>
<P>
   The two surviving males from the original group of 11 brought to
the wilds of Arizona in January _ the first wild wolves in the
Southwest in 28 years _ were recaptured this week. There were
placed in pens with two new females Babbitt delivered last week
from the New Mexico ranch of cable-TV mogul Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Those four wolves will be released in about two months, and four
more wolf packs will arrive this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wolf killing occurred near Hawley Lake, on the Fort
Apache Indian Reservation, between Show Low and Springerville.
</P>
<P>
   Like four others, the wolf appeared to have been shot, said Tom
Bauer, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in
Albuquerque. Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Marks, a rancher and spokeswoman for the Arizona
Cattlemen's Association, said now is a good time to end the
program, since all the wolves have been rounded up and none is
running wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money do they have to spend before they admit that
it's a failure, for the wolves and for the community? It's been a
cruel experiment,'' said Marks, who lives in the isolated Blue
Primitive Area, which has been the primary wolf release area.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal
government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the
wolf killers to $50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and
Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all
three areas; the government should close unneeded roads in the
Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness
status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range; and
ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf
releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (ranchers) may not have pulled the actual trigger. But by
creating this anti-wolf climate up there, they have encouraged
whoever did it,'' Suckling said.
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders of Santa Fe environmental groups _ Pat Wolff of New
West Research, and Sam Hitt of Forest Guardians _ said the federal
government has failed to fully investigate information they have
collected that they say points to wolf bounties of up to $35,000
being offered by an as yet unidentified man from Catron County,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   They said a tape recording they obtained of a federal prison
inmate in Tucson indicates a wolf bounty was being offered by
someone affiliated with the New Mexico ranching groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's laughable,'' said Caren Cowen, executive secretary of
the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. ``Patricia Wolff has
really gone off the deep end this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing our case through the courts. There is no
reason to go out and senselessly and needlessly kill an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the
killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered
Species Act of $100,000 and a year in prison, but they also would
risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt, of Forest Guardians, also has called on Babbitt to bring
in the FBI, saying the law enforcement officers of the Fish and
Wildlife Service are prone to intimidation by ranchers and not
backed up by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said more federal officers are already assigned to the
case and there is no need to involve the FBI, but if the help of
other federal agencies is needed, he will call for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot,
three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and
presumed dead, and four remain. In addition, the pup of one of the
wolves killed _ the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in
half a century _ also is missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Holaday of Phoenix, the 76-year-old retired computer
systems analyst that led the decadelong charge to return the
wolves, called the wolf killings ``beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so . . . difficult to think that there are people with so
much hate in their lives . . . to do such atrocious acts,'' Holaday
said. &QL;
