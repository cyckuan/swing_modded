<HEADLINE> Mexican Gray Wolves Being Relocated </HEADLINE>

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A pack of Mexican gray wolves that  
repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being 
relocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officials have tracked the pack -- an adult male and  
female, a female yearling and an unknown number of pups -- for two 
weeks, following complaints from ranchers in the Apache National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and  
officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate 
the pack to an area free of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to  
intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, 
instead of deer, elk and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried an experiment in that location and it didn't work  
and they're responding,'' said C.B. Lane, director of natural 
resources for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, which opposes 
the reintroduction program. ``It gives us a good feeling that the 
government does understand that there's more to life than just 
where the wildlife are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, federal wildlife officials said they have confirmed  
two attacks on calves, including a death Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National  
Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not 
participated, in the calf killing. Federal officials said there 
have been other instances where wolves chased cattle but were 
driven off by people. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and  
northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near 
extinction by the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern  
Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program. Five 
captive-born wolves released last year were killed and others were 
re-captured.
