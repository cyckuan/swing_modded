   ALPINE, Ariz. _ Last spring, Bobby Fite peered down the sight of
his .22 magnum rifle at what he thought was a coyote stalking two
newborn calves near his house here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw that scope on her, then I saw that box on her, and I
thought, man, that's one of them wolves,'' Fite, a rancher, said,
recalling how he lowered his rifle after he realized that the
predator in his pasture was a Mexican gray wolf, or lobo.
</P>
<P>
   Newly reintroduced after ranchers exterminated them half a
century ago from the high timberlands of eastern Arizona, today's
lobos wear radio collars that allow them to be tracked by
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   But the wolves have had a rocky return to Arizona's forests this
year. Of the first batch of 11 released in March, five were shot,
two are missing and presumed dead, and the rest had to be
recaptured for their safety while biologists reworked the program.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists released two pairs into the wilderness.
This time, the hindquarters of each wolf were spray-painted orange.
The radio collars were also painted, orange for males, pink for
females.
</P>
<P>
   The paint should not interfere with the wolves' mating habits,
because the animals are color blind. But some environmentalists
grumble that, even though the intent is to protect the wolves,
marking them this way is the equivalent of painting fluorescent
targets on their backsides.
</P>
<P>
   The paint is to help hunters distinguish Mexican wolves, one of
the smallest wolf subspecies in North America, from coyotes, the
garden-variety predators of the West. In much of the rural West,
coyotes can be legally shot year round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes are varmints,'' said Sam Luce, another rancher near
here. ``They are in our chicken houses, killing our chickens,
killing our barn cats. A lot of the sportsmen consider them a
target. That puts the wolf in a bad situation, because he looks
just like a coyote.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rash of wolf shootings in the fall, wildlife officials
angrily called the killings ``sabotage.'' But now they say it
appears that errors by hunters may account for most of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that many local ranchers were hostile to the release of
the wolves, biologists worked early this year to monitor the
animals and remove them from areas with sheep and cows. They also
educated ranchers about the penalty for intentionally killing a
Mexican wolf, an endangered animal, on public land: a fine of up to
$100,000 and a jail term of up to one year.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts appeared at first to be successful. Until the
hunting season began in August, only one wolf was shot and killed _
by a camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ranchers wanted to shoot wolves, they would have shot
them in April, May, and June, when the wolves were in town, in
calving pastures, among sheep, among horses,'' said Diane
Boyd-Heger, a wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, who has directed the introduction program. ``The local
people had plenty of opportunities to shoot these wolves. I really
don't think it was the ranchers.''
</P>
<P>
   But things took a turn for the worse with the annual fall
invasion by hunters of the Apache National Forest, which surrounds
this tiny village. Before the season began, wildlife officials had
mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000
hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions
in the wolf area.
</P>
<P>
   But from August through November, four wolves were shot dead
over an area the size of Connecticut. According to the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service, which is leading the
investigation into the killings, at least three guns were used.
Rewards totaling $45,000 have been posted for information leading
to an arrest and conviction in a wolf killing case.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by losing half of the wolves in the first year,
biologists plan to release in the National Forest here next March
two more packs, totaling nine wolves. The goal is to have a
population of 100 Mexican wolves roaming the National Forest by the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior and a former
governor of Arizona, has stressed his support for the program in
two visits this year to this mountain town, a five-hour drive from
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in October of 720 Arizona residents by the Behavior
Research Center, a Phoenix company, found that 61 percent of
respondents said they had become more supportive in recent years of
efforts to protect endangered wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But in this economically depressed corner of the state, many
people see the wolves as another blow imposed by outsiders to a
rural economy already hurt by dramatic reductions in timber
harvests from public lands and in the number of cows that ranchers
can have graze on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got plenty of predators around here already _ mountain
lions, coyotes, lots of bears,'' said Luce, a retired doctor whose
cattle grazes on his own land along the Blue River. He said that
every fall when his neighbors rounded up cattle from grazing on
National Forest lands, they regularly discovered that they had lost
about 10 percent of their calves to predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This competition just throws these wolves into the cattle,''
said Luce, who added that, in May, a wolf killed his 8-year-old
trained cow dog, which he valued at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Anderson, a big-game hunting guide, said over lunch at the
Bear Wallow Cafe here that he had no problems with a few wolves in
the woods. ``But if they get 100 up here, I don't know what will
happen,'' Anderson said, as his blue tick hunting hounds barked
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by articles in hunting magazines about wolves killing
hunting dogs in Minnesota, he said: ``I have hounds that I have
turned down $4,000 for. I guess, I'll just keep my fingers
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   The wolf release program was opposed by the ranching
associations of New Mexico and Arizona, the governors of both
states and by votes of county commissioners in 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the polarization caused by the wolf release, on Dec.
6 someone fired a shotgun into the offices of a Santa Fe, N.M.,
animal rights group. The group had received an anonymous letter
threatening ``to kill any wolf reintroduced.'' Four days later,
someone spray-painted in large letters, ``Wolves'' and ``N.M. Needs
Wolves'' on the building that houses the New Mexico Cattle Growers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Cattle Growers' Association sent out a press
release urging hunters to boycott a Fish and Wildlife Service
questionnaire about the wolf killings. Slipping into the kind of
harsh language that often has surrounded the wolf program, the
association called the query ``Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control
federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised
reintroduction program.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with sharp criticism by three of New Mexico's congressmen,
the Service retracted the questionnaire last Friday. &QL;
