MEXICAN GRAY WOLVES IN ARIZONA TO STAY: MORE LOBOS ON WAY

   PHOENIX _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered
Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona
governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today (WED. JAN 13) in the
Apache National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances
and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf
reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this
winter _ perhaps as many as 17.
</P>
<P>
   Some wolves may even arrive by helicopter as researchers attempt
to keep the captive-bred wolves as wild as possible by releasing
them in the most inaccessible parts of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to make these wolves as wild as possible, and keep
them wild,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, Mexican wolf biologist for the
Arizona Game and Fish Department.
</P>
<P>
   All the wolves released this winter sport bright orange, pink or
yellow markings on their fur and their radio-location collars, an
attempt to prevent hunters from mistaking them for coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists continue to post a $50,000 reward
for the arrest of those responsible for last year's wolf killings,
while ranchers continue their opposition to the reintroductions
with a new federal court petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a government program that can destroy an individual
and his private property,'' said Sam Luce, a rancher along the
isolated Blue River whose trained cow dog, Pepi, was killed by a
wolf last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears expressed by ranchers and others, no cattle, sheep
or people have been killed or injured by the wolves, which
generally feed on overpopulated herds of wild elk.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists plan to re-establish a self-supporting
population of at least 100 wolves in eastern Arizona and western
New Mexico by 2005. At that point, the wolves might be removed from
the federal Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   The lobos of the Southwest are the rarest subspecies of wolf in
North America, and their recovery is the No. 1 priority among
international wolf experts. There are fewer than 200 at 40 zoos and
breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction efforts across the West represent a complete
reversal of policy by the federal government. Earlier this century,
government agents _ acting on behalf of ranchers _ shot and
poisoned Mexican wolves, leaving none in the wilds of the United
States after 1970 and none in the wild in Mexico after 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, (Jan 7 ) the first of up to four new wolf packs
arrived in eastern Arizona _ an adult pair and their three
8-month-old pups. Their arrival comes a year after Babbitt brought
11 wolves to Arizona to get the program started.
</P>
<P>
   Another adult pair and two more pups arrive today, two pairs of
adults were released Dec. 11 and two more pairs of adult wolves may
arrive before the end of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Although they wear brightly colored collars, their thick winter
fur could obscure these markings, and hunters remain responsible
for identifying their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers plan to release some wolves inside the Blue Range
Primitive Area, one of the first places in the national forest
system to ban motorized vehicles. No pens or other structures can
be built inside the primitive area, so wolves released there might
be brought in by helicopter and immediately left to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But even the primitive area hosts a few ranchers, like Bill and
Barbara Marks, who fear the wolves brought in by helicopter will be
too close to their spring calving grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our reward for opposing the program,'' said Barbara
Marks. The Markses, like most ranchers in the West, own a small
amount of private land surrounded by government lands they lease
for their cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 wolves brought to the wilds of Arizona last year, five
were shot dead, one is missing and presumed dead and three were
recaptured for their own protection. In addition, the first Mexican
wolf pup born in the wild in half a century is missing and presumed
dead. Of the original 11, the two remaining males were paired last
month with two new females.
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 reward is offered for information leading to the
arrest of those responsible for the deaths of the wolves, whose
killing is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and a year in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, there have been no arrests, and speculation is
growing among those involved in the reintroduction that the
killings may have been random acts by hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Babbitt condemned the wolf killings and
promised that no matter what, more wolves would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who did it, but it's a tragic event. It's not in
anybody's best interest, whether they're hunters or ranchers or
anyone else.'' &QL;
