<HEADLINE> Cost of Missile Defense Debated  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Like nearly every other aspect of the proposed
national missile
defense, its cost is hotly debated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon is still working on an estimate, but its most
recent estimate last spring put the tally at $36 billion for a
system with 100 missile interceptors at a single site, in Alaska.

<P>
   The figure covers the building and operating of the system for
its expected life of 20 years.

<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,
estimates it will cost $60 billion if -- as many missile defense
proponents urge -- the system is expanded to two interceptor sites,
each with 100 interceptors.
