<HEADLINE> Clinton Opposes Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today voiced opposition to building a costly new national missile
defense system that the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has
been advocating.
</P>
<P>
In a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in New
London, Connecticut, Clinton said that the Republicans's proposal
"would force us to choose a costly missile defense as long-range
missile attacks on the United States is extremely remote".
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters earlier in
the week that the so-called the rogue nations could not build
long-range missiles against the United States in at least 15
years.
</P>
<P>
It makes little sense to build a system now "before we know the
details and dimension of the threat we face," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has insisted that the United States should
develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. It
has proposed to add billions of U.S. dollars to the Pentagon
budget in the fiscal years of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained
a national missile defense program, expressing concern that it
could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia.
