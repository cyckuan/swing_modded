	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy  
a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on 
land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of 
conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr., chairman of  
the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon 
anti-missile programs during the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from  
countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency'' 
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14  
retired officers and defense and political officials who served 
mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White 
House of failing to make missile defense a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in  
spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve 
$6.6 billion over the next five years for program development. 
</P>
<P>
	A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the  
Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10.5 billion to 
build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to  
defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less 
than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy. 
</P>
<P>
	The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's  
22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as 
well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay 
tracking data. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19  
billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile 
defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American 
troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the  
Defense Department had no comment on the Heritage Foundation 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy already has spent $1 billion developing a so-called  
theater missile defense system to protect ships and troops from 
regional threats, mostly from short- and medium-range missiles. But 
it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a 
missile out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy,  
the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can 
defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise 
missiles. It could take years before scientists and the defense 
industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, 
intercontinental missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national  
missile defense system, partly because it would violate the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the ABM treaty is no longer valid because it was  
negotiated between the United States and the former Soviet Union, 
not Russia.
