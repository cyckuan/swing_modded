<HEADLINE> Republican Nationwide Missile Defense Bill Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans in the U.S.
Congress have been blocked by Democrats in their efforts for a
legislation to deploy a nationwide ballistic missile defense
system by 2003, Congress sources said today.
</P>
<P>
By a party-line vote of 53-46 Tuesday, the U.S. Senate fell
short of the votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster against
the missile defense legislation sponsored by Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 votes were needed to end the debate and bring on
a vote on the Defend America Act calling for the deployment of the
defense system.
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued during the Senate debate that a national
missile defense system is needed now because of the growing threat
of missile attacks on the U.S. targets. But Democrats expressed
their support for the U.S. administration's stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has said that he favors a national
missile defense but does not believe that the system should be
deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that the missile defense system would be too
costly and undermine the strategic arms treaties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
A recent Congressional Budget Office study estimated that the
missile defense system would cost as much as 60 billion U.S.
dollars at its first stage.
</P>
<P>
The estimate has prompted the House Republican leaders to pull
their version of the bill, sponsored by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States
and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense
system. Russia has deployed its system around Moscow. The United
States has no defense against a long-range missile.
