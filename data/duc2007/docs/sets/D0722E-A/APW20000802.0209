<HEADLINE> Group Wants US to Halt Missile Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain should push the United States to halt
plans for its national missile defense system, a parliament
committee on foreign affairs recommended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would
allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the system argue that the program would increase
Britain's vulnerability to attack without offering coverage by the
U.S. defensive screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Affairs Committee into Weapons of Mass Destruction
recommended that the government urge the United States ''to seek
other ways of reducing the threats it perceives,'' rather than try
the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The bi-partisan committee in its report said it was not
convinced that the missile defense program ''represents an
appropriate response to the proliferation problems faced by the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   It also questioned the program's feasibility, noting that two
out of three tests on the system didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also warned that Russia and China opposed the
program, which could be ''dangerously destabilizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has set a target date of 2005 for having a national
missile defense ready for use.
