WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military today tested
over the Pacific Ocean a sensor designed to detect and track
incoming nuclear missiles, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
A rocket carrying an optical sensor and data system was fired
from Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands for the test
under the national missile defense program, it said.
</P>
<P>
The sensor, built by Boeing Company, located dummy warhead
targets from a Minuteman-2 missile launched 21 minutes earlier
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.
</P>
<P>
Now in its initial test stage, the sensor is designed to be
mounted on small rockets to collide with enemy nuclear warheads
once they are identified and tracked.

The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a
national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether
to deploy it within three years.

Defense Secretary William Cohen has announced plans to spend an
additional 2 billion dollars on the multi-billion missile defense
program over the next five years.
