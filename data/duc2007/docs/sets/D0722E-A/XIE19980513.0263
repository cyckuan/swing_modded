<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense System Test Fails Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon's fifth missile
defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the
Defense Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD
system, was done at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The
missile, built by Lockhead Martin Corp., lost control shortly
after launch, the statement said. It appeared to be caused by a
booster rocket problem.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the missile range about three kilometers north
of the launch site. The interceptor missile and target debris
landed on the missile range, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The test at 7:20 a.m. EDT was the eighth overall for the THAAD
and the fifth involving an actual missile flight and attempted
intercept.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD system is designed to provide U.S. forces in the
field protection from attack by Scud and other short- and
medium-range missiles. It is to provide broader defensive coverage
than the Patriot missile system.
</P>
<P>
The program, emerging from former U.S. President Ronald
Reagon's "Star War" plan 15 years ago, was to be deployed in three
years if necessary.
