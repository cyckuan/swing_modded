	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Revised estimates of nuclear missile  
capability, particularly of North Korea and Iran, add new urgency 
to development of a national missile defense system, the Clinton 
administration's top arms-control official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cold war disciplines are gone. Technology is more widely  
available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms 
control and international security affairs, told a Senate 
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders were to rally on the steps of the  
Capitol today to applaud President Clinton's signing of a 
GOP-sponsored bill committing the United States to a national 
ballistic missile defense against limited attack, as might be 
launched by a small nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have  
occurred on the missile-defense front: 
</P>
<P>
	--Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to  
consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty 
to consider easing that prohibition against either American or 
Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental  
missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White 
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense  
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton 
administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could  
develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are 
secretly doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty,  
national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in 
planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of 
Republican members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly  
very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few 
years ago, Holum said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed an earlier bill committing the nation  
to a missile-defense system. But in a compromise with congressional 
Republicans, he agreed this year to support similar legislation, 
the bill he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in  
particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is 
now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy 
against proliferation,'' Holum testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to  
serve in the new post. He had served since 1993 as director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of 
business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as  
early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard 
Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it will make decisions on details of a  
missile defense system next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than blindly follow the ABM restrictions, Holum said, ``I  
believe our missile defense should be geared toward threat.''
