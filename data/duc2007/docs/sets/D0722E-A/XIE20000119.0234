<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. prototype missile
interceptor streaked into space on Tuesday night in search of a
mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in California, but
failed to hit the target, the U.S. Defense Department said.

<P>
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to
develop a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile
range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes
after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California at 9:19 p.m. EST (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
