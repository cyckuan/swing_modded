<HEADLINE> Proposed Missile Defense Tested  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon conducted two tests Thursday of
important elements of the proposed national missile defense system
in preparation for another attempt to shoot down a target in space.
</P>
<P>
   In the first test, a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic
missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., released
20 objects in flight to test the ability of a prototype
ground-based radar to distinguish among them. In a real missile
intercept mission, the radar's role would be to keep an
intercepting missile on a collision path with its target and not
allow it to be fooled by decoys around the target.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the Pentagon office
in charge of the program, said preliminary indications are that the
prototype radar successfully distinguished among the 20 objects in
space.
</P>
<P>
   The radar is situated on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the second test, conducted about two hours after the first,
also involved a Minuteman III missile launched from Vandenberg. It
was designed to test elements of the national missile defense
system -- such as an ''in-flight interceptor communication system''
used to send information from the ground radar to the interceptor
missile -- that will be used in the next attempt to shoot down a
mock warhead in space.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that next test is expected
to be conducted early next year. Until recently that test was
scheduled for November, but the timing has slipped due to technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The two previous intercept attempts failed, most recently in
July.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, President Clinton announced that more testing was
needed before he could have enough confidence in the technical
feasibility of national missile defense to authorize the start of
construction. Clinton said it would be up to the next president to
decide whether and when to go ahead. His decision effectively ended
missile defense supporters' hope of having a system ready for use
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Thursday's tests show that the Pentagon is moving
ahead with development work even though deployment has been put
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on our normal schedule to continue development of a
national missile defense system,'' he said.
