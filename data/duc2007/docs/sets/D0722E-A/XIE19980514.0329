<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Testing Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Department said
Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile
defense system despite five consecutive test failures.
</P>
<P>
"We're bound to have failures," Defense Secretary William Cohen
told a Senate defense subcommittee Wednesday, a day after the
fifth straight failure of test on the system.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "technology can be very complicated." But he added
that Pentagon would press forward with the 15 billion U.S. dollar
program.
</P>
<P>
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) failed to
intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White
Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary investigation indicates that the THAAD missile
lost control shortly after launch," the Pentagon said in a written
statement. "The missile impacted on the White Sands Missile Range
about two miles north of the launch site."
</P>
<P>
The missile system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is designed
to protect troops in the field from attack by Scud and other
short- and medium-range missiles. It is supposed to be an
improvement on the Patriot missile system.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's budget request for missile defense
seeks 822 million dollars for continued testing and development of
THAAD next year and the House National Security Committee has
endorsed that figure.
</P>
<P>
The Army wants to begin buying 40 interceptor missiles as a
first installment on a system that is projected to cost 15 billion
dollars to acquire and 18 billion dollars to operate over 20
years, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests in the last couple of days backed
Republican lawmakers' call for a national missile defense system.
They cited India's nuclear tests as fresh evidence of the need for
such a program.
