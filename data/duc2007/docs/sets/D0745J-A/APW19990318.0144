	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is America ready to welcome O.J. Simpson back  
as a commercial spokesman? A lawyer referral service thinks so, and 
the company has videotaped him making a pitch for legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies,  
said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor 
to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants 
to have adequate legal representation. He said he was paid only 
enough to cover his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at  
minority defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a  
courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in 
a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money  
to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 
1994 criminal trial. He was acquitted on charges of murdering 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with 
a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and  
Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 
million in damages. Any income he receives can be seized by the 
estate of Ms. Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the  
messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola 
University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assuming they are targeting an African-American audience, it's  
still iffy,'' she said. ``And it's kind of sad. Isn't there anybody 
else in the African-American community who can speak out for 
justice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in  
which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people lost years of their lives,'' Simpson said. ``If  
any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they 
wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was innocent,'' he said, ``but what if I had had to wait 16  
years to be vindicated?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but  
said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do 
bad things. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the  
public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''
