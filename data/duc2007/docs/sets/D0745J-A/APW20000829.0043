<HEADLINE> CBS Plans O.J. Simpson Miniseries  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six years ago this summer, O.J. Simpson was a
defendant in the most-watched murder case in American history.
Viewers sat glued to their TV sets as the saga unfolded in what
would be dubbed the Trial of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a TV miniseries is reproducing the experience and exposing
audiences to what they didn't see during the yearlong trial:
behind-the-scenes battles and strategy sessions by the defense
''dream team'' which won Simpson's acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   It will air on CBS in November unless O.J. Simpson is able to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson sent his lawyers to court this month seeking a
preliminary injunction to halt production on ''American Tragedy.''
So far, his 11th-hour legal bid has been futile. A judge refused to
issue an injunction, saying he'd look at the script and revisit the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, production will be completed by the time Simpson's
suit gets back to court on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   What is this movie and why does Simpson want to shut it down?
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the soundstage in North Hollywood is an adventure in
deja vu. Actors bear an eerie resemblance to Marcia Clark, Robert
Shapiro and Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, among others. The
courtroom where the case was tried has been duplicated in every
detail including floral arrangements that often decorated the
judge's bench.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding hand behind the production is Lawrence Schiller, who
wrote the book ''American Tragedy'' with James Willwerth based on
information from his ''mole'' on the defense team, lawyer Robert
Kardashian.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller is directing from a script written by Pulitzer
Prize-winner Norman Mailer, and he has assembled a top notch cast
headed by Ving Rhames as Johnnie Cochran Jr., Christopher Plummer
as F. Lee Bailey and Ron Silver as Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller, who collaborated with Simpson on a jailhouse book, ''I
Want to Tell You,'' recently directed another miniseries from his
book ''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' a recounting of the Jon
Benet Ramsey murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson
Defense,'' published in 1996, was controversial from the start:
Lawyers felt it invaded Simpson's attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality. Eight members of the defense filed affidavits last
week saying they had been misled into giving interviews to
Schiller. But the author's lawyers pointed out that no one took
legal action until the miniseries was nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller says neither Simpson nor anyone else was promised prior
approval on the book or script. Cochran and Shapiro have met with
the actors portraying them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This story isn't about O.J. Simpson. It's about the lawyers,''
Schiller said in an interview. ''The public doesn't know what took
place behind closed doors, how the defense dealt with the evidence,
how they pushed the envelope in the court system. To me, that is
more interesting than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a Simpson ''body double'' sits at the counsel table
during filming of court sessions, his is not a speaking role. A
Simpson voice is occasionally heard on an intercom talking to his
lawyers during their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Segments of actual trial footage will be seen in the miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   The actors have spent many hours immersing themselves in trial
history, reading books and watching hours of trial videotape. Most
of them were avid fans of the televised trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I watched the trial. It was the hottest show in
town,'' said Plummer. ''One is not particularly proud of having
watched it. It was sort of the fascination of watching a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actor, who recently played Mike Wallace in the movie,
''the Insider,'' said the chance to play the legendary F. Lee
Bailey was irresistible, and he found the miniseries much more than
''a ghastly replay of the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about the defense team and the quite amazing ego
challenges involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of playing Bailey included a physical
transformation for Plummer, whose body was padded and his face
altered by a rubber mask.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a wonderful character,'' said Plummer. ''He represents
the high-flown old school of lawyering, the old man, the
curmudgeon. I'm sure he loves his drink and I do too, so I
sympathize.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Silver, who bears a striking resemblance to Shapiro, added
thick eyebrows and shaved a bald spot on the back of his head.
Silver has met with Shapiro more than once but said the lawyer
claims never to have read Schiller's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read Bob's book and I've talked to other people about
him,'' said Silver, who concluded that Shapiro laid the groundwork
for a brilliant defense but was forced to the sidelines by others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the trial started, he became quite marginalized,'' said
Silver. ''Everyone had their agendas. But his obligation to his
client kept him there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the movie hews to the book, it will not take a position on
whether Simpson was truly innocent of the murders of his ex-wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson was
acquitted in criminal court and later found liable in civil court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what the truth is,'' both Plummer and Silver said
separately. But one cast member said he became convinced that truth
was never the aim.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing about the search for the truth is laughable,'' said
Bruno Kirby, who plays attorney Barry Scheck. ''In a courtroom,
it's about winning. Both sides are there to win ... I hope this
(movie) makes people look at the system and see that it needs
work.''
