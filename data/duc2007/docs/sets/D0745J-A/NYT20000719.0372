O.J. SIMPSON PROMOTES NEW WEB   SITE: ASKOJ.COM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   O.J. Simpson will appear on a series of television programs next
week, including ``Today'' on NBC and ``The View'' on ABC, to
publicize a Web site on which he will take questions from the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews will be rare television appearances for Simpson,
who, in the years since his acquittal on murder charges in 1994,
has been extensively interviewed only on Black Entertainment
Television in 1996 and on ESPN in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Simpson will be interviewed on ``Today'' by the
anchor Matt Lauer. On Wednesday he will appear on the ABC daytime
program ``The View,'' talking mainly with Barbara Walters and Star
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Wednesday he will be seen in an afternoon segment on
the Fox News Channel, and that night he will appear on the same
channel on the program ``The Edge'' with Paula Zahn.
</P>
<P>
   In all the appearances, Simpson will discuss the start-up of the
Web site AskOJ.com, established by the Entertainment Network, a
company that operates adult-oriented Web sites. Internet users, who
will be able to direct questions to him, will be charged a $9.95
fee to register for the site, said Brian Barry, a spokesman for the
company and Simpson. They will also be able to purchase what Barry
called ``O.J. memorabilia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. will be donating all his potential earnings from the Web
site to charity,'' Barry said, but he did not provide details of
the financial arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of ``Today,'' said Simpson
was doing the interviews to ``publicize the start of this Web
site.'' But both Zucker and Bill Geddie, the executive producer of
``The View,'' said no conditions had been placed on the interviews.
Zucker said Lauer would ``ask the questions you'd expect him to be
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker gave some examples: ``How is he supporting himself? How
are people treating him? How is he dealing with the financial
judgment against him?''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife,
Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997. He was ordered to pay
Simpson's and Goldman's families financial judgments totaling $33.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Geddie emphasized that ``The View'' is ``an opinion program''
and said, ``The image of O.J. sitting in the center of our panel of
women was too powerful to resist.'' He added, ``I think he knows
he's going to be sitting with people who believe he's a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said he expected some viewers to be unhappy that
``Today'' was giving Simpson a forum to discuss his Web site, but
said, ``It's certainly a newsworthy interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Geddie said Simpson had originally contacted Walters about doing
an interview for her ABC News program, ``20/20,'' but said,
``Barbara did not want to interview him on that show.''
</P>
<P>
   Geddie added that the scheduled NBC appearance influenced his
decision to book the interview. ``Having him on the `Today' show
helped me,'' he said. ``I don't know if we would have gone out on a
limb to be the first to put him on. Being on `Today' gives it some
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said the Entertainment Network was based in Tampa, Fla. He
described it as a ``company that creates voyeuristic Web sites.''
