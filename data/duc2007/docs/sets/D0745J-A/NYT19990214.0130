   LOS ANGELES _ At 6 p.m. Tuesday, O.J. Simpson's ``Garage Sale of
the Century'' takes place online. Unfortunately, he won't be around
to make change for a $20.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house on Sunset Boulevard
conducts the live bidding process for Simpson property seized to
help settle the $25 million civil judgment won by the families of
murder victims Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Online and incognito, the auction is accessible through
LiveBid.com ( http://www.livebid.com ) as well as Yahoo! Auctions (
http://auctions.yahoo.com ). Pre-auction registration, which has
already been very active, is required.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the online process that took place recently for Mark
McGwire's 70th home run ball _ the highest bid was used as a
starting point for the (begin ital)real(end ital) bidding done at a
Chicago auction house _ this will go along in real time, allowing
those who just want to sit and watch do so.
</P>
<P>
   You may have already seen the flashier stuff up for grabs, such
as his '68 Heisman trophy, expected to fetch more than $100,000.
But included in the 77 pieces are many other awards given to him
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Such as Lot No.1049 _ two trophies awarded by Life Savers to him
in 1973 for being Life Saver of the Year and Life Saver of the
Month. According to the auction house information, the latter
piece, which at one time had a statuette of a man affixed to the
top of a silver-plated cup, is now broken. &QL;
