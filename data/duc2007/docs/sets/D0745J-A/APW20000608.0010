<HEADLINE> Simpson Will Take Lie Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson will take a lie detector test if
someone puts up a $3 million reward to catch his ex-wife's killer,
defense attorney F. Lee Bailey announced on CNN's ''Larry King
Live'' Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Simpson passes the test, the reward money would be put in a
trust fund and paid out for information about the crime. If he
fails, the letter of credit pledging the money will be dissolved,
Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The results will be made public either way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be publicly seen, win, lose or draw,'' said the famed
defense attorney, who represented Simpson at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''O.J.'s not trying to make O.J. rich. He's trying to get enough
money out there to smoke someone out,'' Bailey told King from West
Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the former football player told The Associated Press
that he never has taken a lie-detector test but was hooked up
briefly to a polygraph machine to see how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey on Friday had said during a Florida hearing where his
license to practice law is being challenged that he suggested
Simpson be stopped from completing a lie-detector test after the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. However, he
was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a subsequent civil
trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   King also had Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, on the program.
Goldman said he hopes ''no one is stupid enough to give money ...
so he (Simpson) can smile at the world and claim he's innocent
again.''
