   LOS ANGELES _ O.J. Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million
judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the
families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded
to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This foundation is not about Mr. Simpson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal
``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held
responsible for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his
fundamental right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in America, justice is supposed to be fair and it's
supposed to be blind,'' Simpson told reporters, ``and public
opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count. You're
supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in
the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings
would say it was legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his
income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge
judgment. For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a
paid interview to a German television station and asked the station
to pay the money to a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to chase him and file suit against those he
fraudulently conveys money to,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, a civil jury found Simpson liable for the
stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. The
appeal, filed 17 months after that verdict, could take months or
even years to resolve. In 1995, a criminal jury acquitted Simpson
of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the
2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil
trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary
rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   The former football star's attorneys said the judge should have
excluded evidence that Simpson had a history of violence against
his former wife. They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their
efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles
Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The brief criticizes the inclusion of several civil trial
witnesses, including a veterinary clinic worker who claims she saw
the couple fight over a fur coat, and a former security guard who
testified Simpson smashed a windshield and dented a Mercedes-Benz
coupe with a baseball bat in a jealous rage.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gelblum, one of the Goldmans' attorneys, predicted the
appeal wouldn't have much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same issues we litigated twice already in the trial
court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a batterer, always a batterer,'' he said. ``He was liable
for murdering Nicole and Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldmans' attorneys said they will continue to pursue
Simpson's assets. Later this year they plan to auction off his
Heisman Trophy, Gelblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Nathanial Friedman, who successfully sued
Charles Manson on behalf of the family of one of Manson's victims,
called Simpson's appeal ``an absolutely outrageous abuse of the
taxpayer-supported court system of California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His guilt is so self-evident that any reasonable person says
he would have emigrated to Brazil or Mozambique or some other place
if he had the slightest shred of decency,'' Friedman said.
