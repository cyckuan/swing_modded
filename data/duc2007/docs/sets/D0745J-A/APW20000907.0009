   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson has lost a bid to block
broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense
team secrets to an audience of millions.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the script, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe
refused to issue a preliminary injunction Wednesday. The judge said
he was unconvinced the broadcast of ''American Tragedy'' would harm
Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996
best-selling book on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just no necessity'' for an injunction, the judge said,
noting that Simpson can collect damages later if he wins his
lawsuit claiming Lawrence Schiller, who co-wrote the book and
directed the miniseries, and Robert Kardashian, Simpson's former
defense lawyer, violated privacy contracts and published
confidential material.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased, of course,'' said Gary Bostwick, a lawyer
representing Project 95, the movie's producer, and Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson lawyer Terry Gross of San Francisco said an appeal was
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   However, both sides admit they are unlikely to get an appeal
judgment before the miniseries' Nov. 12 air date. No trial date has
been set for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, the miniseries focuses on the tensions and
strategies of the legal ''dream team'' that won Simpson's acquittal
in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her
friend, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was found liable for the killings
in a later civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
