	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Potential bidders expressed qualms  
about buying O.J. Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the 
collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the whole thing a little bit sad, to take away the  
Heisman Trophy,'' said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles, who came to 
view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on 
Friday. ``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college  
football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned. The catalog 
noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as 
``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the  
Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said  
Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the 
Butterfield and Butterfield auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home  
at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. They 
won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the 
murders in criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred  
Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he 
would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to  
help satisfy the $33.5 million civil court judgment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown  
pockets,'' Beardsley said. ``I believe he's not responsible for 
this crime, and I think there are a lot of people who believe 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery  
were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson 
during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No. 
32 football jerseys; oriental carpets; paintings and Tiffany-style 
lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned  
by Simpson's first wife, Marguerite.
