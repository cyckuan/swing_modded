<HEADLINE> Greens Accuses Howard Government's Standing on Kakadu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Greens accused the Howard
government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had
become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in
stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area.
</P>
<P>
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage
Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian
government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United
Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds
the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
</P>
<P>
"The Howard Government has now in the space of 12 months become
the leading agent in undermining world agreements and
environmental conventions," Brown was quoted by Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has become the ace environmental pirate on the planet and
Australia's international reputation is being very grievously
damaged."
</P>
<P>
At its meeting in Kyoto, the heritage bureau expressed "grave
concerns" about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's
cultural and natural values.
</P>
<P>
But after intensive lobbying from the government the bureau
decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed
report saying what had been done to "prevent further damage and to
mitigate all the threats" to the park posed by Jabiluka.
</P>
<P>
If that report was not satisfactory, the bureau said Kakadu
should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining the likes
of the war torn old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged
through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right
around the globe".
</P>
<P>
The bureau's recommendation would be put to the World Heritage
Committee this week for a final decision. It was unlikely the
committee would disagree with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
"This has come out of an intense political lobby devoid of any
environmental or cultural rhyme or reason by the Howard
Government."
</P>
<P>
Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of
Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people
did not agree with its decision.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot proceed with building a mine without damaging the
cultural and environmental values of the Jabiluka valley and
therefore the world heritage area," he said.
