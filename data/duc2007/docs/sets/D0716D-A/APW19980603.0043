New uranium mine edges closer to construction

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The opening of Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the
latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the
development.
	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said it expects to begin
digging at the remote Jabiluka mining lease in the Northern
Territory this month, after the territorial government on Tuesday
signed authorizations allowing work to begin on the mine's entrance
and shaft.
	   But the company may be left with nothing but a hole in the
ground, as it goes ahead without having formal approvals to either
build a processing plant or to truck ore to an established mill at
its nearby Ranger mine.
	   ERA has been forced to consider building a second mill just 13
miles (22 km) from Ranger by Aboriginal landowners' refusal to
accept its preferred option, to transport the ore.
	   The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine, claiming it
will cause environmental and indirect cultural damage. But they are
bound by a 1983 contract approving the mill-on-site option.
	   Representatives of the Mirrar Aboriginal clan said Wednesday
they will seek a court order blocking the territorial government's
approval until an environmental approval process for the on-site
mill plan is completed.
	   ``We believe the minister cannot make a thorough decision
without considering the environmental assessment for the milling
option,'' spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio. A similar injunction was last week lifted by the
territory's Supreme Court.
	   Philip Shirvington, chief executive of ERA, a subsidiary of
North Ltd., said there was only a ``small risk'' the company will
not receive the remaining environmental approvals.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   The mine will add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2
billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about
30-year mine life, it says.
	   Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable
uranium reserves, but has only about 14 percent of the world
market.
	   For more than a decade until 1996, government policy prevented
the opening of new uranium mines. Currently there are only two,
ERA's Ranger and Western Mining Corp. Ltd.'s Olympic Dam.
	   ERA's success at Jabiluka is considered a litmus test for at
least a dozen other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
