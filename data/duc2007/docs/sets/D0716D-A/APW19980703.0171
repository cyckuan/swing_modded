	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ More than 100 protesters were arrested
Friday after overwhelming police and storming onto the site of a
proposed new uranium mine in Australia's north, police said.
	   About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by
anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s
planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles (300
kms) east of Darwin.
	   About 180 protesters climbed a security fence and walked onto
the construction site, said spokeswoman Megan Kinninment.
	   ``They were reclaiming the lease for the traditional Aboriginal
owners of this land, the Mirrar people, who have been opposed to
this mine from the start,'' she said.
	   Police Superintendent Gary Smith said dozens of protesters
stampeded over police on their way to the site, elbowing officers
out of the way. Police were considering laying assault charges
against the demonstrators.
	   Construction of the Jabiluka mine _ Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade _ began in June, after a protracted legal
battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing
environmental protest.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian
dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an
about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world
uranium market.
	   Almost 100 arrested protesters had been taken to Darwin because
the jail at the nearby town of Jabiru was not big enough, Smith
said.
