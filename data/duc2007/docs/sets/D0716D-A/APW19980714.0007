	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police arrested more than 100
protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine
development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern
Territory.
	   The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn,
according to a statement issued by the protesters. Of these 130, 20
``locked on'' to machinery in the compound.
	   The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since
March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
	   The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action
began to about 350.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide
in ore at Jabiluka and plans to mine the deposit over 30 years.
	   The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
	   Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent
scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment
from uranium mining at Ranger.
