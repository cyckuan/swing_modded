<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects UNESCO Report on Kakadu National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for
Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the
endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka
uranium mine.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific
evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be
threatened by the development of the mine.
</P>
<P>
Hill said the report of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage
mission contained "several errors of science, law and logic".
</P>
<P>
Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the
Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km.
</P>
<P>
Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian
government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to
the park, but the government rejected their environmental
concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the
mining project is important.
</P>
<P>
Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly
demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National
Park on the in-danger list".
</P>
<P>
The findings of the mission report were inconsistent with the
fact the Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had
operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
</P>
<P>
"This proves mining can occur on leases adjacent to Kakadu
without harming World Heritage values," he told journalists in
Canberra.
