<HEADLINE> Australia Okays Controversial Uranium Mining Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government today
gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining
plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in
revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today defended the
government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on
development and environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000
square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World
Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason, therefore, why it should not go ahead,"
Howard was quoted today by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
evening TV news program as saying.
</P>
<P>
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated the
Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could
provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently to lobby domestic support for the
decision, the minister made it clear that the government is
looking to Jabiluka's export potential rather than uranium for
domestic use.
</P>
<P>
"Jabiluka means Australia could become the leading world
uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to
peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total
of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product
over 28 years.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision however has been condemned by
environmentalists and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dark day for Australia when our most precious World
Heritage area is consigned as a 60 million ton radioactive waste
dump," Wilderness Society national spokesperson Virginia Young
said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said the
government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area
and environmental concerns.
