	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government will have
until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from
declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka
uranium mine.
	   At its meeting in Kyoto, Japan, UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau
on Saturday night expressed ``grave concerns'' about the impact
Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural world values.
	   But after intensive lobbying from the Australian government, the
bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world
heritage areas considered to be in danger.
	   Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed
report by April 15 next year saying what had been done to ``prevent
further damage and to mitigate all the threats'' to the park posed
by Jabiluka.''
	   The bureau said that if the report did not show that the threats
posed by Jabiluka had been properly dealt with, Kakadu should
immediately be put on the in danger list, joining other areas such
as the war-torn old city of Jerusalem.
	   Last Wednesday, the committee called for the scrapping of the
mine.
	   Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as
biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity. And while the report
was thought to be an embarrassment to the Australian government,
Hill stressed that the committee's findings had no legal standing
and that construction of the mine would not stop.
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.
