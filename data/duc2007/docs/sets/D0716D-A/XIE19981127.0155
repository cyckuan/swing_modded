<HEADLINE> World Heritage Chief Rejects Australia's Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) --The Australian government's
criticism of a report on the Kakadu National Park was
extraordinary, head of the World Heritage mission to Kakadu,
Francesco Francioni, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium
mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and
raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's
endangered list.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report
as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee
Bureau meeting in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
While talking over ABC Radio from Tokyo, Francioni rejected
Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
He said the recommendations were designed to remove real and
potential dangers from one of Australia's most famous national
parks.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of the drafting group reflected the views
of the report.
</P>
<P>
"I find it quite extraordinary that this language is used,
especially since I personally ensured that the mission cooperated
and remained open to any kind of input and any kind of interaction
with the Australian government."
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage convention was supposed to be an instrument
of cooperation and not a forum for adversary politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has already insisted that Jabiluka
remain open, which would almost certainly see Kakadu placed on the
endangered list if the World Heritage Committee accepts the report
of its mission to Australia.
