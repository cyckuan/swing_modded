U.N. panel says uranium mine should be stopped

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A United Nations World Heritage
committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed
Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
	   The committee said the proposed mine would pose a severe danger
to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National
Park.
	   ``The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and
mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed,'' the committee said
in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
	   However, federal Environment Minister Robert Hill has blasted
the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity.
	   ``I am disturbed and distressed about the quality of this
document,'' Hill said. ``There has not been a case developed that
could, in any way, lead to the conclusion they have reached.''
	   Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers)
of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast,
incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile
(200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal
species, including many that are rare or endangered.
	   The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and
cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
	   The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million
metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the
environment.
	   ``The mission has noted severe ascertained and potential dangers
to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu National Park,
posed primarily by the proposal for uranium mining and milling at
Jabiluka,'' it said.
	   The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel
that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural
values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World
Heritage Bureau.
	   The company has already begun construction of its Jabiluka
uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not
part of Kakadu.
	   The ERA also promised it would rehabilitate the site ``to a
condition ecologically and culturally compatible with Kakadu.''
