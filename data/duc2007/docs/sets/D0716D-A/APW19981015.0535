	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A rowdy group of protesters was ejected
from uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s annual
general meeting Thursday after interrupting chairman Campbell
Anderson's address.
	   Those ejected, members of an environmental group called the
Wilderness Society, had been protesting against the company's
Jabiluka mine development in the Northern Territory.
	   The demonstrators had bought shares in ERA, a subsidiary of
North Ltd., to gain entry to the meeting.
	   Most of those ejected by security guards were young women who
were carried out of the meeting still screaming.
	   During the melee, one protester cried out: ``Don't you care
about our children?''
	   ``Hopefully you won't have any,'' Anderson replied.
	   Protesters also repeatedly asked the board questions about
environmental risks of the proposed mine.
	   Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified
more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the
largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion
Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over
about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium
market.
