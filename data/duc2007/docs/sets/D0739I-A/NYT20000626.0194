 (Includes a color slide of Jason Alexander in a scene from ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd end up in the movie version of `Rocky and
Bullwinkle,''' Jason Alexander says, flashing a cherubic grin
tinged with mischief. ``When I was a kid, my favorite cartoon was
`Magilla Gorilla.' I always wanted a part in that.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the actor who got famous playing a hapless schlep
on ``Seinfeld'' (1990-1998) is about to hit movie screens as Boris
Badenov, half of the inept team of Boris and Natasha in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' opening nationwide on June
30.
 &HT;    ``I watched several episodes of the series and then looked in
the mirror and thought, `Yeah, that's me,''' Alexander says with a
chuckle. ``They did shave off half my eyebrows, though, and I want
everyone to know I was wearing a fat suit _ I did not gain weight
for this film.''
 &HT;    Based on Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon characters, ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' mixes animation and live
action in a tale that pits the flying squirrel and moose against
Boris, Natasha (Rene Russo) and their boss, the evil Fearless
Leader (Robert De Niro).
 &HT;    It's De Niro's goofiest role by a long shot, but Alexander
nonetheless admits that he was intimidated at the thought of
working with the legendary actor.
 &HT;    ``Actually, De Niro was very nice,'' he recalls, ``but a bit of
an introvert. Rene and I would be kidding around, and he'd just be
kind of quiet. You start thinking, `Is he preparing? Is this part
of his process?'
 &HT;    ``And everybody was calling him `Mr. De Niro,''' Alexander adds.
``I was `Jason' and Rene was `Rene,' but he was `Mr. De Niro.'
Finally we had a scene where they had to move the mark where he was
supposed to stand about two inches. They were all going, `Mr. De
Niro, we've moved your mark about two inches, will that be a
problem, sir?'
 &HT;    ``I finally said, `Look, this guy has gained and lost 5,000
pounds for roles, he's been hit in the face by professional boxers,
just make him move like everybody else!'''
 &HT;    Alexander laughs.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately,'' he says, ``everybody, including Mr. De Niro,
broke up, and that was sort of an icebreaker.''
 &HT;    No icebreaker was required with Russo, who Alexander says
reminded him of his first days with ``Seinfeld'' co-star Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
 &HT;    ``Usually there's a learning curve when you work with somebody
for the first time,'' he says. ``But with Julia, she came in the
door and said, `Let's do it.' It was the same with Rene _ when I
met her, she said, `I think you're really funny, so show me how to
be.'
 &HT;    ``We had a lot of fun, which was fortunate, because we're sort
of joined at the hip during the entire film.''
 &HT;    Alexander has 4- and 8-year-old sons, but he says they didn't
influence his decision to accept ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' In fact,
he doubts they'll even see it.
 &HT;    ``My children are so unimpressed with me that it's pathetic,''
he says. ``I can't get them to watch anything I'm in. They never
saw `Seinfeld,' and they won't even watch `The Hunchback of Notre
Dame,' where I did the gargoyle voice.
 &HT;    ``I think my children hate me,'' he concludes. ``I may go into
therapy about it.''
 &HT;    His own childhood, spent in a middle-class New Jersey suburb,
was no picnic, Alexander says.
 &HT;    ``I wished I could have been invisible,'' he says, suddenly
serious. ``I was very heavy, and I got picked on a lot. I spent my
early school years trying to disappear.
 &HT;    ``Then I discovered a pre-emptive strike _ getting kids to laugh
with me instead of at me,'' he recalls. ``I had dozens of comedy
albums, and I just memorized the material from all these comedians
and tried to do it exactly like they did. I would imitate their
voices, their timing, everything.
 &HT;    ``It seemed to work,'' Alexander says. ``Suddenly I wasn't
getting picked on anymore. But I was not the class clown, and I
never thought of being an actor _ I was just trying to survive.''
 &HT;    By the time he was a teen-ager, however, he had begun singing
and dancing lessons, which paid off when he headed for Broadway. In
1989 he earned a Tony Award for his performance in ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway.''
 &HT;    In fact, he says, if it weren't for Nathan Lane he might still
be on Broadway, since Lane often snagged roles Alexander was after,
and vice versa.
 &HT;    ``I'd see him at an audition and say, `Maybe we should just flip
a coin to decide which one of us should leave,''' the actor
recalls. ``I'd be up to replace him and he'd be up to replace me.
The sad part is that Nathan and I never ended up doing anything
together.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, true stardom awaited Alexander on television,
in the form of the bumbling, self-obsessed George Costanza.
 &HT;    ``I'm always kind of stunned by the love people have for
George,'' he says, shrugging. ``I get letters from people going,
`You know, my friends tell me I'm just like George.'
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `You either need therapy or different friends _ that
is not a compliment.'''
 &HT;    Alexander settles back reflectively.
 &HT;    ``I guess what was charming about George, if that's the right
word, is that he was an everyman who went through an everyman's
problems with the world,'' he muses. ``He reacted with anger and
self-aggrandizement but, to his credit, he also was
self-deprecating. It's why people love Howard Stern _ he's vicious
and inappropriate, but he skewers himself more mercilessly than
anybody else.''
 &HT;    Alexander may be a star, but he's avoided most of the Hollywood
lifestyle, and has been married to Daena Title for 18 years.
 &HT;    ``It's dumb luck,'' Alexander says with a smile. ``But when you
get toward middle age, you hit a bump. Daena and I have had some
problems, and a couple of years ago we went into therapy and worked
on them.
 &HT;    ``It's not easy,'' he concedes. ``It's not fun. But if you have
something valuable, you do it. We came out at a better place than
when we started our relationship. I'm very lucky, because I'm
married to an exceptional woman.''
 &HT;    Raising their children has been made much more complicated by
Alexander's success on ``Seinfeld.''
 &HT;    ``Fortunately and unfortunately, you can't escape the fact of
celebrity,'' he says. ``There are perks and there are problems. For
instance, we want our kids to have a normal life _ but I can't take
them to the supermarket, because I'll get too much attention. So we
have an assistant go to the market and, if they want to go, they go
with the assistant. That's not normal, so it's kind of a vicious
cycle.''
 &HT;    ``Seinfeld'' made its cast members rich, with Alexander,
Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Michael Richards pocketing $600,000 per
episode for the final season. Alexander admits to mixed feelings
about the whole thing.
 &HT;    ``Am I worth almost a million dollars?'' he says. ``I remember
something Jerry Seinfeld said, when they asked him if he really
needed 42 Porsches: He said, `Let's get something straight _ I
don't even need one.'
 &HT;    ``So I don't need a million dollars,'' Alexander concedes. ``But
in the TV marketplace we were running circles around everybody
else, so why not?
 &HT;    ``But the world is bent on its ear in that respect _ nothing I
do is worth what a schoolteacher does.''
