   Seinfeld was en route from New York to Albuquerque, N.M., in a
1973 Volkswagen Beetle this week when he decided to pull into this
country music town to see an old friend and collect on a gold mine

   On Tuesday, Seinfeld took in a show at the Bobby Vinton Theater.

the facilities are,'' Chris Vinton said.
