	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jerry Seinfeld has a new girlfriend, and Jerry
Seinfeld's new girlfriend has an angry husband.
	   Seinfeld took up with 26-year-old Jessica Sklar soon after she
married Broadway theater scion Eric Nederlander four months ago,
the New York Post and the Daily News reported this week.
	   Nederlander, whose father owns six theaters and a piece of
baseball's Yankees, is filing for divorce. A furious Nederlander
called his bride a ``gold-digger'' who ``won't get a cent,'' the
Post said Tuesday, quoting an unidentified close friend.
	   The Post said Seinfeld began seeing Sklar after she returned
from her honeymoon in Italy last summer. But friends of the couple
said the marriage was doomed from the start and the breakup has
nothing to do with Seinfeld.
	   Seinfeld's spokeswoman did not immediately return calls Tuesday.
The Post said he is mortified by the mess.
	   Dan Klores, a spokesman for Nederlander, said: ``The family is
appalled by the behavior of Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Flatley, who hung up his ``Lord of the
Dance'' shoes last summer, agreed Tuesday to pay his former manager
a ``substantial sum'' to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit.
	   The terms were not disclosed.
	   John Reid claimed he was summarily dismissed in a letter in
1997, seven months after the management contract was signed. The
contract was not due to expire until this month.
	   Reid, who sought dlrs 17 million, said Flatley fired him just as
the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged.
	   ``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind me,'' Reid said.
``It is a real shame that so much time and money and effort has
been wasted in the process of getting to the point which we could
have reached two years ago.''
	   Flatley said Reid was abusive and preoccupied with other
clients.

	   LONDON (AP) _ George Martin's score for Elton John's ``Candle in
the Wind '97'' _ the best-selling single of all time _ will be
auctioned off for charity.
	   The arrangement, written in a hurry by the legendary Beatles
producer last year for the tribute to Princess Diana, is expected
to fetch about dlrs 100,000 when Sotheby's holds the sale in New
York in December, the auction house said.
	   A special award from the British Phonographic Industry marking
33 million copies of the single sold will be auctioned with the
score.

	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A New York-Duesseldorf flight
arrived Tuesday with one more passenger than had checked in: a
30-centimeter (12- inch) snake.
	   A young woman spotted the snake slithering between her feet just
before take off. Still, the flight went on as scheduled.
	   Another passenger took control of the situation, wrapping the
the creature in two plastic bags and setting it in a bathroom for
the duration of the trip, Duesseldorf airport officials said.
	   Police were called to meet the plane to identify the snake,
which turned out to be harmless and was turned over to a zoo.
	   It was unclear how the snake got on board the plane.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A woman awoke in bed Tuesday to find
a carpet snake wrapped around her arm and its teeth embedded in her
leg.
	   Katherine Bell, 34, said she was sleeping alongside her
6-year-old daughter Carla when she felt a pain in her leg at about
4 a.m.
	   ``I thought it was my cat playing on my bed,'' said Bell, of
Brisbane.
	   ``I went to move my arm to turn on the bedside light but it (the
snake) was wrapped around my arm and its mouth was biting my
knee.''
	   Bell staggered out of bed, flailing wildly to free herself from
the snake.
	   Loosing herself from the two-meter (two-yard)-long reptile, she
threw it to the floor before fleeing the room.
	   The snake escaped into nearby woodlands through a sliding door.
	   Ambulance officers took Bell to nearby Redland Bay Hospital for
treatment to puncture wounds on her leg, knee and finger while
police called in a snake handler, who found the reptile.
	   Carpet snakes are not poisonous, but can inflict a painful bite.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit.
	   A plane chartered by a prominent rabbi to encircle Israel seven
times and deliver prayers for the successful conclusion of the
Mideast peace talks was forced to make an emergency landing.
	   A little more than an hour into Monday's flight, the small
plane's electrical system malfunctioned.
	   ``We changed the subject of the prayers from the plight of the
Israeli people to our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of
Rabbi David Batsri and one of four passengers aboard.
	   ``My father ... called out the names of chapters in Psalms,
chapters named after angels, and then he asked them to come and
help,'' the younger Batsri said.
	   The pilot eventually brought the plane down safely in northern
Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri said the passengers' deliverance was
proof that a similar miracle could happen at the Wye, Maryland,
talks.
