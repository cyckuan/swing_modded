`SEINFELD' SECOND BANANAS ARE ENJOYING SECOND CAREERS 
BY STUART ELLIOTT

<P>
   Almost two years after America watched the final episode of
``Seinfeld,'' the second bananas on that popular series are
enjoying second careers in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the
principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played
George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and
Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range
and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld. Among the blue-chip brands
they have peddled are AT&AMP;T, American Express, Clairol, Tommy
Hilfiger, Pepsi-Cola, Rold Gold and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many of the actors who played supporting characters on
``Seinfeld'' are also turning up in campaigns for products ranging
from automobiles and candy to soft drinks and prescription drugs.
The sidekicks taking center stage include Estelle Harris, who
played George's mother; Wayne Knight, Newman; Phil Morris, Jackie
Chiles; and Patrick Warburton, Puddy.
</P>
<P>
   Such interest among marketers and agencies in characters with
smaller roles is unusual after a show ends production. Typically,
ad work goes to the actors who were the better known stars of a
series, even though it almost always costs more to hire them than
their supporting cast. Examples include Barbara Billingsley, June
Cleaver on ``Leave It to Beaver''; Sherman Hemsley and Isabel
Sanford, George and Louise Jefferson on ``The Jeffersons''; and
Florence Henderson, Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Seinfeld'' broke rules for the content of TV sitcoms;
conventional wisdom held that viewers would not warm to characters
who were whiny, New Yorkers or identifiably Jewish. Now the show is
breaking rules on the selling front.
</P>
<P>
   ```Seinfeld' was so long running,'' said Tom Lom, managing
director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Health Care in New York, which is
using Knight at his Newmanian worst to personify the flu bug in a
campaign for the prescription drug Relenza sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
``And it's still on the air in reruns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So people remember the characters from the prime-time run,''
he added, ``and still get exposed to the characters through the
reruns.''
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``Seinfeld'' appeared on NBC in May 1990
and the last episode appeared in May 1998. The reruns, syndicated
by the Columbia Tristar Television Distribution unit of Sony
Pictures Entertainment, are shown on 224 stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the show is not on, the familiarity is there,''
said John Clarke, chief advertising officer at Dr Pepper/Seven Up
in Plano, Tex., part of Cadbury Schweppes. For the Diet Dr Pepper
soft drink brand, Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York created a
commercial with a courtroom theme featuring Morris in his persona
as the slick lawyer Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also donned his Chiles regalia _ mustache, glasses,
stylish suit _ for two humorous spots for the Odyssey minivan sold
by the American Honda Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of people in the minivan category, young families,
watched or are watching `Seinfeld,''' said Larry Postaer, executive
vice president and creative services director at the Honda agency,
Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the commercials, ``we thought it might be fun to
bring on a celebrity lawyer as a surprise,'' Postaer said. ``But
the real ones don't do that _ or shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave us someone who is recognized,'' he added, ``and
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is not the only ``Seinfeld'' second banana doing double
duty for advertisers. Warburton has worked for the Cadillac
division of General Motors and the M&AMP;M's line of candy sold by a
division of Mars Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed all the shows he was on, but when he played a cop in
the Cadillac commercial I came into the office and asked my group:
`That guy is great. Who is he?''' recalled Charles R. Miesmer, vice
chairman and senior executive creative director at the M&AMP;M's
agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often, like in sports, a team gets assembled that has
four or five Hall of Famers on it,'' Miesmer said. ``That show had
so many actors who were so good.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of using secondary characters was described by
Patrick Sherwood, president of the Los Angeles and Troy, Mich.,
offices of the Cadillac agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, part
of the B Com3 Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little bit below the radar in a commercial
context,'' he said, ``which was important for us because we wanted
a different voice for the Cadillac brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Warburton was seen as engaging, entertaining and
credible, not a shill,'' he added. ``Coming from an ensemble cast,
he had an ability to react and a degree of spontaneity that was
really refreshing. He was so successful, he did several spots for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appeal of the ``Seinfeld'' second-stringers, not all
of them can expect to be on the first team for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clarke at Dr Pepper/Seven Up said he would not
consider a commercial with Larry Thomas, who played the unwelcoming
proprietor of a soup store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to encourage people to come in,'' Clarke said,
laughing, ``not chase them out.'' &QL;
