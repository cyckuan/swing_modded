	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Television viewers still in withdrawal  
over the end of ``Seinfeld'' could have gotten a quick fix -- in 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	The hugely successful American sitcom also is this nation's most  
popular comedy program, and private station ProTV aired a five-hour 
special Sunday to mark more than a year of broadcasting the show.

	Twelve people competed as lookalikes of the Seinfeld characters  
Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer. One, a 31-year-old sketch artist, 
won a trip to New York for his resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld.

<P>
	Seinfeld's jokes have struck Romanians' funnybones. Friends  
often gather to watch the show and many of the expressions, 
including the famous ``yada yada yada,'' have become hip.

	``Seinfeld's kind of humor is different. It's for people with  
brains and I consider it the best comedy show ever made,'' said 
Ilie Vornicu, 24, a geology student.
