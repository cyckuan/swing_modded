<HEADLINE> $100M Seinfeld Suit Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed  
by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his 
identity for the character of George Costanza. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael  
Costanza's suit was frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
	Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his  
rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and 
persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costanza said the show portrayed him in a negative, humiliating  
light, and that ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David defamed him 
when he called Costanza a ``liar'' and ``flagrant opportunist'' 
trying to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed  
sanctions of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer, 
Jonathan Fisher.
