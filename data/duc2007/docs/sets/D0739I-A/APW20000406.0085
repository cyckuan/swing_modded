   NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine Jerry Seinfeld inside his Long Island
mansion, baby bottle in one hand, burp cloth in the other, musing:
Whyyyyy do they call it a burp cloth?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. First came love (1998), then came marriage (last
December)-- and now Seinfeld and bride, Jessica Sklar, will soon be
pushing a baby carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The big announcement was made Thursday by Seinfeld pal Regis
Philbin on TV's ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes. It's true. There will be a new little Seinfeld sometime
this fall,'' said Seinfeld's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first child for both Sklar and Seinfeld, who made
millions from a TV show that glorified single life and poked fun at
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this is now, and soon the 45-year-old
Seinfeld will be up to his diaper bag in commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld apparently asked Philbin to serve up the news for him.
Philbin did it gladly, informing viewers that the little Seinfeld
is scheduled to arrive in October. Clarke did not want to pinpoint
the due date.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrival may have the undevoted attention of his dad, who
retired his series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Seinfeld will also have plenty of room for all that kid
stuff like swing sets, playhouses, bicycles and building blocks.
The couple are reportedly paying as much as $40 million for Billy
Joel's 12-acre oceanfront mansion in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other kids in the neighborhood for playdates.
Steven Spielberg has a place nearby and he has five children.
</P>
<P>
   Just asking: Could a minivan be far behind?
