 &HT;    TBS pays big bucks to rerun `Seinfeld' reruns
 &HT;    By Bob Longino

<P>
   It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has
purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated
repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000
apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime
earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres'
sitcom, ``Ellen.'' Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't
approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run
``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's
distributor, Columbia TriStar TV. Variety estimates that all
`Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's
overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   TBS' contract will bump ``Seinfeld'' repeats, a big ratings
booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta. WATL's pact expires in March
2001. There remains an 18-month period between that date and the
start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Seinfeld' is one of the three shows in history _ 'I Love
Lucy' and 'The Andy Griffith Show' are the others _ to sign off at
No. 1,'' said TBS President Bill Burke, who also recently cut deals
for syndicated repeats of ``Friends'' (to start in 2001) and ``Home
Improvement'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' (both to start in 2002).
``We're very confident of this show. We think it has legs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Seinfeld'' repeats have been a strong performer,
especially in metro Atlanta. The show, now most often airing at 10
o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time
programming. During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set
ad rates worth millions of dollars, ``Seinfeld'' repeats averaged
nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``May was sensational,'' said Don Hess, WATL programming chief.
But four years from now, he said, ``Seinfeld'' might lose its
ratings heat. ``That's what happened to 'Cheers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, however, thinks TBS got a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Seinfeld' is in a very small class of mega-hit shows,'' he
said. ``Networks are not producing a lot of mega-hits anymore. We
think this might be one of the last and wanted to be sure it was on
our schedule.''
