   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of the most
succesful shows in television history, says he'll never do another
situation comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine doing another one. Only an idiot would think
they could do better,'' said Seinfeld, during a press conference
Tuesday, promoting his Sunday night live (9 p.m.) HBO special,
``I'm Telling You for the Last Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing white slacks with a navy polo shirt under a gray jacket,
the 44-year-old comedian joked and jostled with the media over
subjects ranging from sex to money.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the
ending of the phenomenal run of ``Seinfeld'' after 140 episodes,
he's relieved it's over. ``Did you ever take a dog to the park and
take his leash off,'' he asked asked rhetorically. ``The dog looks
up for a minute then bolts like a maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by by HBO's Marty Callner, who will be directing the
special live, Seinfeld explained that returning to stand-up was
liberating. For nine years he worked on a show with 100 crew
members, a dozen writers, and the cast. ``That was very much a
group thing,'' he said. ``Now I feel like the leash is off.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to take a vacation. ``I've been on beaches,'' he
said. ``I've been on boats.'' Then he shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld is not retiring from stand-up, he is retiring all
the material from Sunday night's program. ``You'll never hear these
jokes again,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to work on another special, presumably for HBO,
during the next eight months, and put out a comedy album based on
Sunday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the concert at the Broadhurst Theater are hot. The
New York Attorney General's office is investigating ticket
scalping. The going street rate for a ticket is $1,500, nearly 20
times the face value. Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from
the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in
Learning).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent scalping, '' he said, pausing just long enough
for everyone to realize the absurdity of the situation. ``I don't
really have any control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Seinfeld'' will never be considered controversial, the
show did run into trouble with an episode in which Kramer
accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that episode,'' said Seinfeld. ``People forget that in
that episode Kramer was really looking forward to the Puerto Rican
Day parade and that the whole thing was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans
was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld
raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he
did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly
woman for her loaf of marble rye. ``They brought in snow and we had
snowball fights at five in the morning, and I was trying to throw a
loaf of rye bread up to the fourth floor,'' he said. ``It was just
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from
the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I named who might come, it wouldn't be a suprise,'' he
said. ``How can there be suprise guests if there are no suprises?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Seinfeld observations:
</P>
<P>
   On fame: ``I've been anonymous. Being famous is better.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton: ``Everyone lies about
sex. Truth and sex don't go together. Everyone lies during sex, so
truth just isn't going to happen.''
