EXPERTS PRAISE JUDGE'S RULINGS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks
Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks
but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had
made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer
industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses
under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,''
said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law
School. ``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just
because you are big you can't do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said,
included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to
break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had
decided it abused its monopoly power. Some experts said appeals
courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts
throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of
antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive
competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into
efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or
market existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had
maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the
scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional
antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by
monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that
the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of
antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist
attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft. The company's
chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into
``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as
an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case
differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack
company, said Charles J. Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the
University of Virginia School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that
approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style. ``There has
been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the
public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional
antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be
coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with
engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from
those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law
School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in
the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft
intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it
is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him''
on his factual findings. If those findings are accepted, Elhauge
said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely
sensible'' under legal precedents. Lesser remedies like orders to
monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult
to police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions
was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its
Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied
together.
</P>
<P>
   Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product,
like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage
of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product,
like raw salt, to get the popular product.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more
correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows,
portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal. It was
on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington
overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the
decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally
tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal. But even on that
subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his
approach as consistent with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly
be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try
to protect the decisions from being overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little
support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on
antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving
computer business.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the computer age might require adjustments to
some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating
system and a Web browser are really separate products. But, some of
them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the
heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the
victim of an injustice was a familiar defense. ``Every industry, as
it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law
applies to it.''
