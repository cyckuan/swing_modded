   WASHINGTON _ Here are the milestones in Microsoft's antitrust
dealings with the government:
</P>
<P>
   1990:
</P>
<P>
   May 30 _ The Federal Trade Commission staff opens an antitrust
probe of Microsoft Corp. The agency ponders charges that Microsoft
illegally thwarted competition while adding hidden codes to its
operating system software in a bid to hinder competing applications
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   1993:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 5 _ On a 2-2 vote, FTC deadlocks on taking action against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 20 _ The FTC decides to drops its Microsoft probe. The
Justice Department says it will take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   1994:
</P>
<P>
   July 16 _ Microsoft and Justice Department trustbrusters reach a
settlement that requires the company to change a variety of
business practices, including key aspects of its licensing
agreements with personal computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   1995:
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 14 _ U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejects the
proposed settlement, asserting that it does not go far enough to
curb Microsoft's anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   April 27 _ The Justice Department sues to block Microsoft's
acquisition of Intuit Inc., maker of the popular Quicken personal
finance program. Within a month, Microsoft abandons its proposed
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   June 9 _ Microsoft reveals the Justice Department is
investigating Microsoft Network, its newly launched online service.
</P>
<P>
   June 16 _ A federal appeals court upholds the 1994 settlement,
reversing Sporkin and removing him from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 21 _ U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson approves
the 1994 settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   1996:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 19 _ Microsoft reveals that the Justice Department is
probing the bundling of its Internet Explorer browser with Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   1997:
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 20 - The Justice Department sues Microsoft, charging the
company with having violated the 1994 court-approved settlement by
requiring computer makers to install Internet Explorer in order to
license Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11 - Jackson issues a preliminary injunction that bars
Microsoft from requiring computer makers to install its online
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15 - Microsoft says it will comply with Jackson's order by
offering computer makers two new options, both of which the company
claims would undermine computer performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 17 - The Justice Department asks Jackson to hold Microsoft
in contempt, alleging that the proposed changes fail to meet the
terms of Jackson's preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   1998:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 22 - The Justice Department and Microsoft reach a
settlement on the pending contempt charge.
</P>
<P>
   May 14 - Microsoft and the Justice Department reveal that they
are conducting settlement talks aimed at heading off a wide-ranging
antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   May 18 - After the settlement negotiations fail, the Justice
Department and 20 states file a broad antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The case is assigned to Jackson, who seeks to expedite
the proceedings by setting an early trial date.
</P>
<P>
   June 23 - A federal appeals court rules that Microsoft did not
violate a previous agreement with the government when it combined
Windows 95 and Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 19 - The federal antitrust trial opens in Washington, with
Jackson presiding without a jury. After showing videotaped
testimony from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the government
alleges that the company systematically used its dominance over the
operating system market for personal computers to illegally thwart
competition.
</P>
<P>
   1999:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 10 - The government rests its case after calling 12
witnesses. The prosecution repeatedly seeks to portray Microsoft as
a bullying monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 29 - The defense rests its case after also calling 12
witnesses. Microsoft denies all charges of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   June 2 - After a three-month recess and unsuccessful
secrecy-cloaked efforts to reach a settlement, the trial's rebuttal
phase opens.
</P>
<P>
   June 25 - The last rebuttal witness leaves the stand, eight
months after the antitrust trial began. William Neukom, Microsoft's
general counsel, says: ``The government has put on a great
performance, ``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 10 - Each side offers the court book-sized documents
detailing what each it believes are the real facts in the case.
Microsoft's take: The government proved no wrongdoing in the
eight-month trial. The government's: Microsoft clearly engaged in a
``broad pattern of unlawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 10 - Each side files another stack of voluminous rebuttal
briefs that largely review their prior arguments while disparaging
the opponents' case.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 21 - Nearly a year after the trial began, the courtroom
phase comes to a close with oral arguments from the opposing
lawyers. Once again, the government casts Microsoft as a monopolist
that squelches competition while the company's lawyers accuse the
plaintiffs of unwarranted meddling in the rough-and-tumble software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 5 - Jackson issues his own findings of fact, to be
followed, probably early next year, by his conclusions of law.
Taken together, they will constitute a verdict in the trial _ one
that, barring a settlement, is virtually sure to be appealed.
