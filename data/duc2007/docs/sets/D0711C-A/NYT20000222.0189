CLOSING ARGUMENTS UNDERSCORE GAP BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND GOVERNMENT

   WASHINGTON _ In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the
government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine''
that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's
antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.,
antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that
supported the government's version of the case in nearly every
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are
expected sometime in the next few months. Tuesday's presentations
were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the
federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides
remain divided. Tuesday's courtroom statements _ uncompromising
attacks from each side _ only seemed to underline the gap between
the government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial
lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to
``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry. His
counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of
Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting
on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in
Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have
elements of a loss-limitation strategy. Warden began by saying that
Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the
judge's findings of fact. He then went on to tell Jackson that his
ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's
``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving
industry.'' And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages
competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a
company's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any
other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the
subject with such arguments. Fierce competition is one thing, the
government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of
e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show
Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate
behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has
long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based
cases.'' And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made
reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so
emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court
has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses
and documents show.''
</P>
<P>
   And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant
attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was
that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's
trade _ attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying,
predation _ in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its
monopoly.''
