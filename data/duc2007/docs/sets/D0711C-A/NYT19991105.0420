   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding
victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory
that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to
the simple truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General
Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had
agreed with the government. ``This case is about the protection of
innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the
products they want,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the
antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for
the government on virtually every important point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors
during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always
interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial. I think
this case was about the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead
lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most
highly regarded litigators in the country. At first, Boies shied
away from the microphone. ``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies
said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who
worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say
something. ``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said. ``Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less
to do with strategy and more to do with facts. ``In some senses,
this is not a surprise,'' he said. ``In a lot of ways, this is
exactly what the evidence showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision,
Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is
above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft,
asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was
furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal
e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly
determined to remain a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to
D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications. ``Today, we
have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to
break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry. But Klein
deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to
another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the
nationwide telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta
of consumer protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law
school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when
the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Blumenthal went on.
</P>
<P>
   Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an
example. Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the
case to Friday's decision _ lightning speed for such a complex
case, by the usual standards of the law.
</P>
<P>
   California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said he expected
the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation and
consumer benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so
many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive
opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason for his use of ``cautiously.'' Appeals lie
ahead. Microsoft is a powerful adversary with deep pockets _ not as
deep as the government's, but deep enough to wage a long fight, if
it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft didn't get to be Microsoft by shrinking from the
battlefield.
