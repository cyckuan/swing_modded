MICROSOFT SAYS U.S. SAW BREAKUP REMEDY AS HARMFUL 5 YEARS AGO

   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal
judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal
document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up
Microsoft would be ``against the public interest'' and ``dangerous
to the economy's welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was part of the public record from an older
antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first
suit against the company. The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the
final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the
judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing
from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice
Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28
asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the
remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a
short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing
the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to
Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ``a cosmetic
remedy'' of no real worth. That was to have been the last filing.
But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company
``believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to
focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief.''
</P>
<P>
   While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft
also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously. Among
them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a
company for antitrust violations; all of the previous breakups have
been a result of settlements of antitrust suits. ``For all its
sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to
identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,''
Microsoft wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing,
but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it
``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the
numerous illegal acts found in the current case.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief was taken from
the court record of the Justice Department's first antitrust suit
against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995. That case was
settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an
antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge
can decide whether to approve it. And much of the industry comment
then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement
inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department
filed the brief Microsoft quoted Monday. In it the government's
economist then, Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that
breakup remedies ``designed to return the market to equilibrium''
are ``likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens
to be leading, Microsoft in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the lawyer who is close to the government's case
said, ``That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the
previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary
now.''
