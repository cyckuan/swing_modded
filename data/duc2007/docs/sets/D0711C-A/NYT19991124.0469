   The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on
Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard
Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a
mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret
deliberations. Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include
lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19
states suing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, regarded as both an antitrust expert and a brilliant
jurist, is expected to quickly assess the chances of any settlement
between the two sharply divided sides.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial
judge for the Microsoft case, told lawyers for the two sides that
he had asked Posner to mediate. At the time, Jackson noted, ``I
don't think he is going to be prepared to waste a whole lot of time
if it looks from the outset that it's not promising.''
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is reached, it will most likely happen in the
next two months or not at all, according to another person close to
the case. ``By the end of January, or it won't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is serving as a mediator, not an arbiter, for the
settlement talks. There have been sporadic settlement talks between
Microsoft and the government stretching back to before the suit was
filed in May 1998. Yet the previous efforts stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts expect that Posner will try to deliver a
sobering helping of reality to both sides. They predict he will
tell the government and states that their hand is as strong as it
will ever be, while telling Microsoft to settle before it is hit
with a final ruling that it violated the law, which could sharply
increase its vulnerability to class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Final oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22
before Jackson at U.S. District Court in Washington.
