NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. has agreed to hold
back on the shipment of Windows 98 while settlement talks with the
U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys generals are still
under way.

Sources who reached the public Thursday morning said that the
parties held the 11th negotiations earlier Thursday concerning a
major Sherman Antitrust case that was about to be launched against
the software giant. Microsoft Corp. is making a last minute offer
to settle the charges.
</P>
<P>
However, it is said, that a suit could still be filed unless
Microsoft is willing to make "serious concessions" and changes in
its business practices.
</P>
<P>
NBC News reported Wednesday that the Justice Department and at
least 19 states plan to file historic antitrust cases Thursday
against Microsoft. If they proceed, the suits could be among the
biggest corporate challenges in history, according to analysts.

Microsoft originally planned to ship its new Windows 98
operating system in PC to retailers Friday, and put it on shelves
of computer stores on June 25. Its critics would like to see a
court block the planned public release. To them, the company
purposely embedded a Web brower into the new software which they
claim is designed to enslave the entire Internet-using public to
Microsoft's will.
