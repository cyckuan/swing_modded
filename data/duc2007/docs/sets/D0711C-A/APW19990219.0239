<HEADLINE> Caldera Suit Vs. Microsoft Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust  
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. has been postponed from June until 
next January. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial  
until Jan. 17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed 
in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera  
has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has 
used illegal marketing and licensing tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, a small firm based in Orem, contends Microsoft  
deliberately destroyed the public's demand for DR-DOS, a program 
that enables computers to perform basic functions. One of Caldera's 
expert witnesses calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	New Microsoft filings allege internal memos show DR-DOS's own  
developers knew they had a flawed product and poor technical 
support for frustrated consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we are Microsoft's biggest endorser,'' a DR-DOS  
adviser wrote in 1992. ``(The) majority of all the irate 
individuals I speak with say that they are going back to Microsoft 
because at least they provide support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filings are aimed at sharply limiting Caldera's claims at  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera President Bryan Sparks said Caldera's response to  
Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month. ``We feel we have 
evidence to refute every one of them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Thursday, Caldera attorney Stephen J. Hill asked Benson  
to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	For Caldera to sue Microsoft is ``a David vs. Goliath  
situation,'' Hill said. ``The longer (the litigation) goes, the 
more it costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will  
need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal 
antitrust case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rulings on Microsoft's new filings likely will require written  
opinions and will determine the scope of the trial, Benson said. 
Those decisions will not be completed until May, only weeks before 
the scheduled trial, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	DR-DOS was created by Digital Research Inc. and later purchased  
by Novell Inc., which halted the program's development in 1994. 
Caldera acquired DR-DOS in 1996, along with the right to sue over 
Microsoft's alleged efforts to quash it. 
</P>
<P>
	DR-DOS competed with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
