<HEADLINE> US Government Renews Antitrust Scrutiny of Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department has
renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the
software giant Microsoft Corp., U.S. newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman confirmed Thursday that "we have
an ongoing investigation and it's continuing."
</P>
<P>
Netscape Communication Corp., Microsoft's major rival in the
U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last
month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations
in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer
software.
</P>
<P>
It said that Microsoft was unfairly offering computer makers
financial "inducements" for giving Microsoft's Internet software
an exclusive place on their computers, or for making Netscape's
product "far less accessible to users."
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft dismissed those claims as "wide and untrue."
Microsoft Senior Vice President William H. Neukom said Thursday
that "the facts will show that Microsoft is competing vigorously
and legally."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, based in Redmond of Washington, has been the focus
of antitrust investigations in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Justice Department opposed Microsoft's planned
2-billion-dollar purchase of Intuit Inc., maker of Quicken
personal finance software, and Microsoft had to pay Intuit 46.2
million dollars for the trouble.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has strengthened its antitrust efforts in
recent years as the market competitions are more and more fierce
and complicated.
