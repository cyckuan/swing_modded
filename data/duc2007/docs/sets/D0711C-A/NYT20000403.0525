JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EAGER TO IMPOSE STRICTURES ON MICROSOFT
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Ebullient over their legal victory against
Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that
they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal
judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. His
decision will provide the basis for further court hearings _ and
possibly settlement negotiations _ to determine what remedies to
impose on Microsoft. The company said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what
specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who
must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no final decision has been made,'' Klein said, ``the
department is committed to finding a remedy that will protect
consumers, innovation and competition by putting an end to
Microsoft's widespread and persistent abuse of its monopoly power
and to rectifying its unlawful attempt to monopolize the Internet
browser market.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed
satisfaction over the ruling. ``We are pleased that the court
agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly
power, that it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed
consumers,'' she said. ``Microsoft has been held accountable for
its illegal conduct by a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision culminated the Clinton administration's most
ambitious antitrust effort.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
presidential candidate, said that Gore had no comment on the
ruling. Gore received an icy reception when he visited the
company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., last November. Gore did
not explicitly embrace the antitrust action, but said then that
``the values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that
are sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican candidate,
said that as president he would ``fully enforce antitrust laws,''
but would not discuss specifics of the case because it remained in
litigation and would be appealed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the ruling would bring positive change. ``It will
benefit America's consumers by opening the door to competition,
increased innovation and increased consumer choice in the software
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law. ``It
demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful or
how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart
competition for America's consumers,'' Klein said. ``Competition
has been at the heart of America's economy, and protecting
competition at the heart of antitrust enforcement for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general for some of the states that joined in the
government's case said they favored strict sanctions, which might
include the breakup of the Microsoft. Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal urged Jackson to ``adopt remedies that are as
far-reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuses of its
monopoly.''
