<HEADLINE> Gov't Spent $13M on Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's landmark antitrust  
trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have 
cost $13.3 million over the past decade, the department said 
Wednesday in its first public accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing  
Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business 
lawsuits in decades. The first phase of a two-part verdict could 
come this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the  
expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run 
$750,000 each month. Justice opened the current case in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really rather modest for a case that has been as hard  
fought as this one has, with the caliber of lawyers and economists 
they've put on,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., for example, spent $20  
million over 10 months unsuccessfully fighting antitrust enforcers 
to allow its merger in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department last year asked Jackson to force  
Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs, but the agency typically 
doesn't request attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they succeed on the merits ... it wouldn't be uncommon for  
the judge to order Microsoft to reimburse the costs,'' said Joe 
Sims, a Washington antitrust lawyer and former senior Justice 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency acknowledged it has paid outside experts for advice  
on how to punish Microsoft if the company lost the case, but 
refused to identify them or their pay. It included the pay among 
$2.2 million spent in the current trial on such experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public  
relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and 
other information about the case on its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government disclosures came in response to a written demand  
from Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from Microsoft's home state of 
Washington. The figures did not include money spent by the 19 
states suing the company along with Justice; attorneys general in 
those states have denied requests for such information. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's largest software company with $19.7  
billion in sales this year, hasn't disclosed its own legal fees. It 
declined comment Wednesday. But the company's financial records 
showed ``general and administrative expenses,'' including lawyers' 
fees, of $689 million for this business year, ended June 30. That's 
up 59 percent from last year's $433 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also involved in high-profile litigation against  
Sun Microsystems Inc. in California and against Caldera Inc. in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal antitrust case, Microsoft is using both in-house  
lawyers and attorneys from New York-based Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. In 
financial papers, Microsoft blamed its increases in administrative 
expenses partly on ``higher legal fees, litigation costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fees for Justice attorneys are significantly lower. Lead  
lawyer David Boies, hired from private practice, initially agreed 
to half his $250 hourly rate, then agreed to a $104,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (the government's bill) is a small fraction of what  
Microsoft paid its lawyers in that period,'' said Kevin Arquit, a 
New York antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims agreed: ``If you're defending the antitrust equivalent of a  
capital murder case, you're not likely to be pinching pennies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive  
Technology, a trade group that includes Microsoft, said the 
government's spending bodes ill for the nation's high-tech 
industry: ``If ... it's this cheap to do it, we could be awash in 
lawsuits and really grind the industry to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government opposed Microsoft's merger with Intuit Inc. early  
in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software 
giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995.
