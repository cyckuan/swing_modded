   WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal
offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government
concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust
case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring
a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as
Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad
violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a
week to settle the case before he issued a verdict. The two sides
had been talking for almost four months.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page
settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state
attorneys general who are suing Microsoft. It included so much
technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it. But in
the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in
their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the
weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the
case, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals
there.
</P>
<P>
   But two officials said no new talks had been scheduled. It
remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified
proposal in the next two days. But short of that, the ongoing
settlement talks, which started Nov. 30, are likely to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit
would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this
week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy
hearings. In those hearings, the federal and state governments will
propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose. Between
now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the
case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state
attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.
