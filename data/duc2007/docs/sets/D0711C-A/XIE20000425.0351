<HEADLINE> White House Briefed on Microsoft Antitrust Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Antitrust lawyers from the U.S.
Justice Department were summoned to the White House Tuesday to
brief President Bill Clinton's legal and economic advisers about a
range of options for dealing with Microsoft Corp., including
splitting up the software giant.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that attorneys for the Justice
Department and the 19 states that successfully sued Microsoft for
antitrust violations are considering ways to break up the company
as a method to curb anticompetitive practices.
</P>
<P>
One reported option would be to split the company into two or
three parts, each selling separate products, such as the Windows
operating system and Internet content. Another alternative would
be for Microsoft to divest its popular Office software.
</P>
<P>
The government and the states have the option of filing
separate recommendations, but both sides hope to turn in a single
proposal. Each has until Friday to submit proposed remedies to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled on April 3 that
Microsoft illegally used its dominance in the operating systems
market to hurt competition. The ruling came after a 78-day trial
that began in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft officials have said they will appeal Judge Jackson's
ruling and expect to prevail. They have rejected a breakup, saying
that such a remedy reaches far beyond the evidence presented in
the trail.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the trial record or in this case that
would justify such an extreme and radical remedy," Microsoft
spokesman Jim Cullinan said Monday. "This would be bad for
Microsoft, consumers and the entire industry."
</P>
<P>
A court hearing to consider remedies has been scheduled for May
24.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the government's
proposal, but it may ask for an extension depending on the
remedies requested.
</P>
<P>
If the Justice Department calls for breaking up Microsoft, it
would be the agency's first such action since the 1974 antitrust
suit against AT&AMP;T Corp. that led to the breakup of the telephone
giant.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has already made clear that it will appeal the ruling
against it. The case is considered likely to end up before the
Supreme Court.
