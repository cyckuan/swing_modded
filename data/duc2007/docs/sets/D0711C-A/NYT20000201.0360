FILING OFFERS A WAY TO FIND MICROSOFT VIOLATED THE LAW
</HEADLINE>

   A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft
antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its
Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious
benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers. But he then
proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining
that the bundling strategy violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar
and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson. It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust
law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case. The
intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will
probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government,
Microsoft and antitrust experts. Unlike other filings, it is not an
advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the
other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single
conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief. Instead, he stated
that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in
this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises
doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers
accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading
product. The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft
did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with
its Windows operating system. Microsoft asserts that the browser is
not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free
to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a
``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent
decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal
prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to
read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the
contours of antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software
was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if
prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time
dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal
with physical products like cars and tires. If given a chance at a
software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a
significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current
doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick,
however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly
applies to software products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _
that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a
dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be
whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at
anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its
interlinkage through contract or software.''
</P>
<P>
   Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the
legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate
tying law. ``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible
rationale for finding there were two products and a tying
violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University
of Iowa law school. ``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson
will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court
will buy it.''
