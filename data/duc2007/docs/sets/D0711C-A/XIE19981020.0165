LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Business seemed as usual at
Microsoft headquarters on the first day of the U.S. government's
antitrust trial against this software giant.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Washington D.C., the federal government and 20
states kicked off the trial that accused Microsoft of illegal
activities, including bullying competitors.
</P>
<P>
Back in Seattle, Washington state, where Microsoft is based,
the company fired off five upbeat, product-oriented press releases
and other announcements.
</P>
<P>
Its Web site on Monday carried two articles in favor of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
One of them is entitled "Economist experts challenge underlying
assumptions in government's case," quoting them as saying that the
government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft is depending on
theories that are not supported by the realities of the
marketplace or current economic research.
</P>
<P>
The other which was carried by Los Angeles Times said that
Microsoft is wrongly targeted and consumers would be losers if the
government wins.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Microsoft is scheduled to release its quarterly
financial results, as analysts predicted another solid,
high-profit quarter.
</P>
<P>
Computer Reseller News on Monday quoted a Microsoft employee as
saying that "we are all concentrating on our individual jobs and
only a small number of attorneys and executives are focused on the
trial."
