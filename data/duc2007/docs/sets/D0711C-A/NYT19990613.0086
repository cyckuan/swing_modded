IBM NEGOTIATOR'S TESTIMONY HITS MICROSOFT HARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

   The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of
the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial. His
litany of accusations was lengthy and specific _ threats and
enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp. delivered at
meeting after meeting. His charges were fleshed out with the dates,
places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's
personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first
representative of a PC maker to testify for the government. David
Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the
Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called
``some of the most important evidence in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a
knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on
earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft
charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust
suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the
representative witness for PC makers. Ever since IBM selected
Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in
1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the
PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws
were meant to prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach
and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's
lawyers to try to undercut its contentions. For months, the Justice
Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand
_ and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of
Gateway Inc., who ultimately decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was
told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to
``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce
competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were
rejected. But the legal standard in such cases, established in a
1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be
``uniquely unequivocal'' _ in the airline case, the evidence was a
tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence. The
contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested
discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain
promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows. No Microsoft
contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must
``drop or eliminate'' OS/2. But he insisted that the overall effect
of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for
Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the IBM PC business was _
incentives to aggressively distribute its product. If accepting
those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 _
made by another unit of IBM _ that is mainly a business decision
for IBM to make, they say. IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust
experts say it was probably not a violation. ``It will be very
difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,''
said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and
prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from
so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing
software. When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft
charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the
incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then
getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher
price for Windows than its competitors. The exception was the
Compaq Computer Corp., which received a significantly lower price,
Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing
Windows 95 _ a straightforward business rationale for different
terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on
Microsoft's statement. The document, an internal memo, said IBM
believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded
on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
``IBM,'' the May 1997 document stated, ``currently pays a higher
royalty than our leading competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the
prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows
operating system was submitted in previous testimony. To protect
confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
took that testimony in closed sessions.
</P>
<P>
   If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying
more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more
legal ammunition to the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of
Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the
puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.
