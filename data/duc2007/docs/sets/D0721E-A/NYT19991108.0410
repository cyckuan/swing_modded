   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of
Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from
the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt
legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call upon the president and Congress to come together, put
all differences aside and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act,''
said Shepard's father Dennis at a news conference in front of the
U.S. Capitol. ``We urge our nation's leaders to take every possible
action to end the violence that killed our son.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ``will not end hatred and will not even stop
hate crimes from happening,'' Shepard added. ``But it can reduce
them by making it easier for our federal government to put
resources into the hands of people best suited to combat these
crimes _ local law enforcement agencies.'' Shepard's mother Judy
stood by her husband but did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22,
lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with
a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.
He died five days later. Both assailants were convicted and given
double life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In July the Senate approved the legislation as part of an
appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments, but the House did not. Republican leaders dropped the
measure entirely during a conference committee of House and Senate
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law permits federal prosecution of a hate crime
only if it is believed to be motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin. In addition, the assailant must have
intended to prevent the victim from exercising a federally
protected right, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure would add attacks against people because of
their gender, sexual orientation or disabilities to the covered
crimes while eliminating the protected-right requirement. Thus, it
would make federal prosecutions easier to pursue and relieve local
jurisdictions from the financial burden of trying such
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Monday shortly after the Capitol news
conference, President Clinton said at the White House, ``We must
pass strong hate-crimes legislation.'' He added, ``I want to
express my personal appreciation'' to the Shepards for coming here
to lobby for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol briefing, Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., pressed his
colleagues to adopt the measure before lawmakers adjourn in the
next several days. He cited reports that hate crimes against gays
and lesbians are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be done, and it must be done,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who assessed the chances of passage
at ``50-50,'' said gays and lesbians need federal protection.
``Some crimes are so odious that an extra measure of protection is
demanded by us so that (they) can never again be repeated among us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never again should we in the federal government withhold our
help and stand idly when a Matthew Shepherd is tied to a fence,
beaten and left to die because he is gay,'' Smith added.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republican opponents of the measure of blockig its
passage ``because it has to do with the issue of homosexuality, and
many people are uncomfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., issued a challenge to GOP colleagues
who oppose abortion rights. ``If you are really pro-life as you say
so often in so many debates, then prove it in this case _ that you
are ... pro-every human life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker at the news conference, Robert DeBree, an
Albany, Wyo., sheriff's detective, said that after McKinney was
found guilty last week of robbing, kidnapping and murdering
Shepard, he went back to a detention center and ``was smiling and
laughing'' as he watched news reports of himself on television.
</P>
<P>
   DeBree added, ``We have to got to send a message somewhere, and
it has to begin here. Congress, please pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have hate-crime
laws that include sexual orientation while 20 have hate-crime laws
that do not. Eight states have no hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with lawmakers, Dennis and Judy Shepard
met Monday with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and
Attorney General Janet Reno. On Tuesday, Dennis Shepard said, he
will try to meet with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
