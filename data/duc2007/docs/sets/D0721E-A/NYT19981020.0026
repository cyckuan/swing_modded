   NEW YORK _ What began as a rally down Fifth Avenue to mourn and
protest the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming ended
chaotically on Monday night, with nearly 100 arrests and several
injuries after demonstrators faced off against police officers in
riot gear and on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators and police officers were slightly injured
during the loosely organized rally, whose planners did not have a
permit to march in the street. One woman was hurt by a police horse
when mounted officers were sent into the crowd to disperse the
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a
``political funeral'' to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard,
21, who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in
Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
Carrying a pine coffin and memorial candles, the marchers had
planned to march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to Madison
Square Park at 23d Street.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffling between the marchers and the police broke out at
several points along the route when officers in riot gear tried to
keep the demonstrators on the sidewalk. Several organizers and
marchers accused the police of over-reacting, and said there would
have been no problems had they been allowed to continued along
their planned route.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials defended their response, saying the
demonstrators created a safety hazard by spilling into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Finklestein, a march organizer, said that she was injured
by a police horse when mounted officers rode into the crowd on West
43d Street in an effort to disperse the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking part in a demonstration against the gay-bashing in
Wyoming and here in New York City, which is supposed to be the
center of gay life in New York,'' she said, nursing her swollen,
bruised right ankle while waiting for an ambulance. ``We were doing
nothing illegal, wrong or unsafe, and I was trampled by a horse
ridden by a New York City police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night police officials said that they had made at
least 96 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct. One police
lieutenant injured his finger in the fracas and was sent to a local
hospital for X-rays, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher defended the
police actions. ``They had a right to gather,'' he said of the
marchers. ``But once they left the sidewalk they were endangering
the motorists, they were endangering the pedestrians. And we were
forced to make arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who rarely minces his words when it
comes to civil disturbances, struck a conciliatory tone when asked
about the protest. ``It's a very worthy cause,'' he said on Monday
night in Nashua, N.H., where he was visiting. ``I can understand
why they are so outraged and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchers held aloft signs that said ``Stop Hate Crimes,''
``Homophobia Kills'' and ``Where Is Your Rage?'' Many marchers said
they were marching not only to protest the killing of Shepard but
also to call attention to the problem of anti-gay bias crimes in
New York City, where reports of such attacks have risen 78 percent
so far this year over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As lesbian and gay people, we know that Matthew Shepard is
only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Sara Pursley, an organizer.
``We are people who live every day knowing that this could happen
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the march appeared to surprise both the loose-knit
group of people who organized it and the police. Kelleher said that
the police called in more officers from all five boroughs when the
trouble began. ``We increased the number of people significantly to
put it back under control,'' he said on Moonday night.
