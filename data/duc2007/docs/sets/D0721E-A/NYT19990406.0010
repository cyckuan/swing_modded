EDITORIAL: A STIFF AND PROPER SENTENCE

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6:
</P>
<P>
   Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to the kidnapping
and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard
family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one
whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life. The
sentence of two consecutive life terms saves Henderson from the
possibility of the death penalty but makes it virtually certain he
will spend the rest of his life in prison. It is not yet clear
whether he will have to testify against Aaron McKinney, the
co-defendant who will be tried for capital murder this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jeffrey Donnell said in court Monday, as he dismissed the
defendant's weak apology, that ``The pain you have caused here,
Henderson, will never go away.'' Unfortunately, lawmakers in
Wyoming and in other states seem quite willing to forget what
happened. In the days and weeks after the murder, it seemed that
the nation would be awakened to the virulence of anti-gay beliefs
that partly propelled this murder. Matthew Shepard's youth, and the
horrific way he died _ tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in
the cold _ made many realize that homosexuals need protection from
the kinds of hate crimes that have caused other groups in this
nation's history to live in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a very short time, the old prejudice that homosexuals are
not discriminated against and do not warrant ``special'' protection
has resurfaced in a backlash. The Wyoming Legislature this winter
killed an effort to pass the state's first hate-crimes bill. The
bill would have increased penalties for those convicted of crimes
motivated by bias. Anti-gay bias measures also died in other
mountain states. In an appallingly callous explanation of the
defeat, one Republican leader in the Wyoming Senate said, ``My
feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than
1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to
the latest FBI figures. Matthew Shepard is just one more grim
statistic. The conviction of one man and the trial of another for
his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act. But
state and national officials must still show leadership in creating
laws that send an unmistakable message that such hatred will not be
tolerated in this society.
