<HEADLINE> U.S. Man Jailed for Life For Gay Student Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. man convicted of
killing a gay college student was sentenced Thursday to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty
for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a
21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed
to spare him from lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
McKinney expressed regret for his role in the murder, which
spurred nationwide rallies for legislation against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what to say other than that I'm truly
sorry to the entire Shepard family," McKinney told the court.
</P>
<P>
A jury had found McKinney guilty Wednesday of felony murder,
kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive
life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton praised the jurors' decision, saying
"this verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to
have a tolerant law-abiding nation that celebrates our
differences, rather than deepening them."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our society who
lash out at those who are different," he added.
