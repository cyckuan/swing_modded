	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's  
bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against 
Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a 
drunken, drug-induced rage. 
</P>
<P>
	They also saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Shepard  
was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the pool of 
blood caused by more than a dozen blows as he fought his attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed  
jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed 
his head. McKinney barely glanced up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said  
prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday. ``McKinney 
struck him as hard as he could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death  
penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend 
accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for 
a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a  
remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who  
lashed out when approached for a gay encounter. McKinney's judgment 
that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some 
sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense 
attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual  
encounters when he was younger. In one case, McKinney was forced 
into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die? No, that's ridiculous. No  
manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said. ``That's what Aaron 
McKinney is guilty of -- manslaughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping  
and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked  
the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury 
was seated. Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison. The plea allowed 
Henderson to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron  
Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the 
neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, 
who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry 
this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the  
fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post. Fluty said it 
appeared Shepard had been crying. Shepard was taken to a hospital 
where he died five days later.
