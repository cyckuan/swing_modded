	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities did not discount a possible  
connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial 
bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing 
Rudolph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic is about 75 miles east of the mountainous area where  
Rudolph is believed to be hiding. A news conference is scheduled 
for Monday morning at the U.S. attorney's office in Asheville. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Saturday about a possible link between the explosion  
and Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, 
we don't discount anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, several FBI agents worked the scene outside the  
one-story brick building that houses the Femcare Clinic, where the 
bomb exploded early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was injured and there was little damage because the  
device only partially detonated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation is still going on,'' said Asheville Police  
Sgt. Randy Riddle, who escorted news crews closer to the bombing 
scene Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the  
run since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., 
abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely 
wounded a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three  
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that 
killed one person.
