 &HT;    Rudolph hunt leads to N.C. lookout point

   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Federal agents searching for Birmingham bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph have found what they believe was an
observation point where the fugitive watched the Nantahala
residence of a man whose help he tried to enlist for food and other
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   They believe Rudolph watched the house of 71-year-old George
Nordmann for several days before approaching the health food store
owner July 7.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal document, Rudolph approached Nordmann,
described as a ``nodding acquaintance,'' and presented him with a
list of provisions and five $100 bills. Investigators said the
items requested included batteries, oatmeal, beans and raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a 32-year-old itinerant carpenter who lived for a while
in western North Carolina, is being sought in the fatal bombing of
a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta-area bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 federal agents and scores of other law enforcement
officers were searching the area Wednesday around where Nordmann's
pickup was found Monday afternoon. Agents of the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation were involved in sealing off and searching the Apple
Tree campground near Topton.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also brought in a U.S. Customs helicopter equipped
with infrared viewing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nordmann did not report to authorities he had seen
Rudolph or that his pickup was missing until Saturday, he is not
believed to have supplied the suspected bomber with his truck or
with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not changing from what we originally said _ he (Rudolph)
took it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Responding to media
reports that explosive residue was found in the vehicle,
authorities said they don't know where Rudolph went in the truck,
but they have found no evidence of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running forensic tests,'' Killorin said of the truck,
which was taken to the ATF lab in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined if Rudolph used the truck to haul the
food to some lair or if he carried the load or stashed it.
</P>
<P>
   The food, which included canned goods, is estimated to weigh up
to 100 pounds, Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are unlimited places to dump food around here,'' the
sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin joined in a chorus of federal officials Wednesday in
saying that Nordmann is not considered to have been aiding Rudolph
in eluding capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small community,'' Killorin said. ``There is some
militia activity up there, and this is where the guy lived. Eric
Rudolph is a dangerous fugitive and informing on him is a matter of
concern. But what did he do at the end of the day? He did come
forward. He did the right thing.''
