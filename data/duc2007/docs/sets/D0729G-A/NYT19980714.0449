 &HT;    Truck, witness revive feds' search for bombing suspect

   Andrews, N.C. _ The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have
been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators
to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to
finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion
clinic and three Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that
a Macon County, N.C., man who reported his truck stolen knew
Rudolph and had seen him in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   What was unclear to investigators was why the pickup was not
reported stolen immediately, giving Rudolph time to escape with
another six months' worth of food, which he is believed to have
stolen from the owner of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said this does not mean that the owner of the
truck, identified by the Associated Press and WSB-TV as George
Nordmann, operator of The Better Way Health Food Store, was trying
to help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph. ``What would
you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force
investigating the Birmingham bombing and Atlanta bombings: ``This
is a witness of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann's 1977 blue Datsun pickup truck was recovered Monday
shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested
area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C. Investigators said Nordmann
told them the pickup truck was stolen Thursday, along with a large
amount of food.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was
a friend. And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left
him money to pay for the supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The man waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according to
ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great
hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and
a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were
found on the pickup. ``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we
may,'' the ATF agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators indicated they believe they are closer to Rudolph
than they have been since he was named in February as a suspect in
the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed a
policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson of the bomb
task force declared, ``We are confident that we are dealing with
Eric Robert Rudolph.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they may have missed the 31-year-old
carpenter and experienced outdoorsman by just hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF official said a local law enforcement officer had passed
through the area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found
Monday and that the truck was not there. ``It was not in the
location where it was found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,''
Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million
reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said Rudolph, who as a teenager moved with his mother
and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is
believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard
and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has
re-energized the manhunt. Rudolph had last been reported seen at a
video store in Murphy on Jan. 30. A few days later, a pickup truck
registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the day
of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near Murphy.
Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of the
forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters in
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup
truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at
1-888-ATF- BOMB.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph
was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina. They also
believed he was acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe that,'' Enderson said. ``The search has been
intensified significantly.'' The number of agents in western North
Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had
about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared
into the woods. ``He had stolen another six months worth, or at
least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are
approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was first approached as if it might be
boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain
near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks
that reach 4,500 to 5,000 feet into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foilage is so thick you can't see ... you can't find
anything,'' Thompson said. ``I said all along he was here and he'll
be here until he's caught.''
