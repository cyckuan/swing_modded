   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Eric Rudolph may be hiding in a cave just up the
hill from this western North Carolina town that cherishes how far
out in the wilderness it is. Or he may be thousands of miles away.
There are about as many theories to the bombing suspect's
whereabouts as there are potential hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since
shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala.,
abortion clinic. They think he's still somewhere around here,
probably in an old mine within the 500,000-acre Nantahala National
Forest. A few dozen agents live and work in Andrews, continuing
what is one of the nation's longest and most chronicled manhunts.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Rudolph, an experienced backwoodsman who
would have just celebrated his 33rd birthday, is still hidden in
these woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been long gone for awhile. He's not around
here,'' said George Nordmann, during a recent interview in his
Better Way Health Foods store in downtown Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann said he has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the
72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last
person to have seen Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Rudolph took about six months' worth of supplies
and a pickup truck from Nordmann. The encounter happened on a
Thursday, but Nordmann did not report it to authorities for two
days. The truck was found two days later near the entrance to a
campground just east of here in Macon County.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann gave authorities a detailed description of Rudolph. The
suspect had apparently added a beard and a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   The information did not lead to a quick capture. Instead,
Rudolph, who is a suspect not just in the Birmingham bombing but
also in three Atlanta-area bombings in 1996 and 1997 including a
fatal blast at Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics,
remains at large. He has survived one winter on the run, despite
predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and
the temperature dropped, he would be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Rudolph's connection with Nordmann and the discovery
of buried trash with the suspect's fingerprints on it, federal
agents have not disclosed much about their search. With winter
approaching, officials familiar with the search said that federal
agents will continue to focus on the mountainous, rugged area
around Macon County.
</P>
<P>
   The task force heading up the search has had a change in
leadership in recent months. A spokesman in Atlanta said no
briefings are planned to discuss any new events in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Will Eric Rudolph be caught?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that many people here say they once were
preoccupied with but now just don't care about. Rudolph, a native
of the area who attended Nantahala High School, has become as much
a living part of folklore as a suspect on the run.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Andrews was engulfed by a national media circus as
satellite TV trucks lined the streets, Hundreds of law enforcement
agents saturated the area. The TV trucks are gone and so is the
ostensible federal presence.
</P>
<P>
   Around Andrews and the small communities that lead into the
mountains, the talk has turned to foliage ( a fairly spectacular
season), high school football (the Brevard Blue Devils are ranked
No. 2 in the state) and the tourists, who are the economic
lifeblood of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, residents said they occasionally see agents
buying fuel for their trucks. Otherwise, life goes on.
</P>

<P>
   ``They used to come in here and buy the fancy fanny packs and
all the other stuff they could find. We haven't seen any of them in
awhile,'' said Mary Kelley, a clerk at the popular Nantahala
Outdoor Center, which stands along the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how Rudolph might still be around. Drive a few
hundred feet into the woods, look to your left or right, and you
could be lost in an instant. Natives talk about hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of underground caves and mines and the ability of an
experienced outdoorsman to elude capture.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant near Nantahala Lake, about nine miles east of
Andrews, declares ``Rudolph Eats Here'' on its marquee. Inside, the
signs proclaiming ``We Survived the Rudolph Manhunt 1998. 1999?
2000?'' appear likely to still apply when the calendar changes in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The deer hunting season is under way. Sitting under a tree
silently waiting for a target, Eric Farley said he suspected
Rudolph is in the forest, maybe even close by. But Farley said he
doubted searchers would find him. It makes sense for Rudolph to
stay in the area, Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know Mexico, he doesn't know the beach. He knows
here, and here is a big, big place,'' said Farley, a Graham County
resident.
</P>
<P>
   When Rudolph first escaped into the forest, some cheered his
elusiveness and saw it as an indictment of the FBI and other
federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of
government is native to the mountains of western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But sharing a political view only goes so far. An off-duty
police officer died in the Alabama clinic bombing and a nurse was
permanently maimed, and to many people, those human losses should
not be forgotten in the saga of Eric Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against abortion too _ it's just wrong _ but that's the
wrong way to get there,'' Farley said. ``To me, he's just a
criminal, and he broke the law, and they should catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has posted a $1 million reward for Rudolph's capture,
and he has been placed on the agency's 10-most-wanted list. The FBI
will stay in Andrews until they find Rudolph, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments aren't all that pleasing to some in Andrews,
who want to turn the corner. Nordmann, who operates the health food
store and knew Rudolph, said he suspected the federal agents
actually came to Andrews ``so they could do surveillance on the
militia folks out here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's skeptical that several hundred law enforcement types would
be dispatched to find just one person.
</P>
<P>
   The area has had recent economic setbacks and hopes are high for
a strong fall tourist season. A Levi's jeans factory in Murphy just
closed, and a Baker furniture plant in Andrews is leaving next
summer, said Jackie Lancaster, Andrews Chamber of Commerce
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is on our economic development and getting people to
take a look at us to come here. At least, more so than `We have a
suspected bomber in the mountains','' said Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>
   As she spoke in the chamber headquarters, the five-car yellow
and red Great Smoky Mountains Railroad train pulled up. Lancaster
also gives out train schedules and helps with reservations. The
four-hour round-trips from Andrews to the Nantahala Gorge end this
month for the year, and the remaining trips are nearly filled.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, a group from Georgia boarded the 10:30 a.m.
train. Most seemed intent on snapping pictures of downtown Andrews
before the Great Smoky train pulled away and scribbling a few
postcards. A few said they were aware of the manhunt, but several
expressed no knowledge of Rudolph. Their charter bus driver, Dean
Gilstrap of Gainesville, Ga., couldn't resist a bit of teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em not to wander off too far or he may get 'em,''
drawled Gilstrap.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Living folklore legend, fugitive and mountain man, Eric Rudolph
may fit all those roles. But if he is indeed in the Nantahala
forest somewhere, he probably won't be spotted in downtown Andrews.
He may be more likely by a creek where there's plenty of water and
the trout are hefty.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the situation, Sylva resident Steve Webb said he
could see how the isolation of the forest would appeal to a man on
the run. Webb said he suspected Rudolph was either dead or in
another country, but he keeps his eyes open _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I'd turn him in in a heartbeat even if there wasn't a
reward, but for what he did in those bombings,'' Webb said.
