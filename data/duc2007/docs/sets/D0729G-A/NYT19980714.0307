   ATLANTA _ After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted
for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from
the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount
of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the
truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon,
federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric
Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of
35. Bloodhounds also were tracking the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have the resources that we will find him,'' said
Woody Enderson, the FBI agent who directs the multiagency Southeast
Bombing Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The sighting last Thursday was clearly the most encouraging lead
in a frustrating search that has taken investigators across
hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain since Jan. 29, when a bomb
exploded outside the New Woman All Women Health Care Center, in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing killed an off-duty policeman who was working as a
security guard at the clinic and seriously injured a nurse.
Witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the
explosion, and the North Carolina license plate on the man's truck
was traced to Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know
for sure that he's in this area and that we are able to focus in on
a much smaller area than we have before,'' said Enderson.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter with ties to extremist
religious groups, also is wanted for questioning in three bombings
in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997, including the July 27, 1996,
explosion at Centennial Olympic Park. That explosion killed one
woman and injured 111 people. Seven people were injured in a pair
of explosions on Jan. 27, 1997, outside a building housing an
abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburbs, and five were injured in a
Feb. 21, 1997, bombing at a gay nightclub in midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rudolph has only been formally charged in the
Birmingham bombing, forensic evidence suggests that he may have
been responsible for the Atlanta bombings as well, investigators
have said. In early May, the FBI placed Rudolph on its list of the
10 most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for
information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said that the man identified as Rudolph had appeared on
Thursday evening at a residence near Nantahala Lake, not far from
where Rudolph once lived. He said the fugitive took a blue 1977
Nissan pickup truck from the occupant of the residence, whom he did
not identify. He said Rudolph also took a large amount of food from
the resident, possibly enough to sustain him for five or six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the resident provided a description that
enabled them to produce a new sketch of the previously clean-shaven
Rudolph, showing him thinner, bearded and sporting a ponytail. He
was last seen wearing camouflage fatigues, a camouflage jacket and
gloves, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson declined to say specifically whether the resident knew
Rudolph. ``Keep in mind that pretty much in this whole area, people
know each other,'' he said. ``The extent of the association I'm not
going to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that the resident, who was described as the owner
of a health food store, did not report the truck as stolen until
several days later. It was found, broken down and abandoned, at
about noon on Monday at the Bob Allison Campground, a picnic area
in the Nantahala National Forest, the official said. The official
also said that authorities found a note inside the truck explaining
who it belonged to, and they identified the handwriting as
Rudolph's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert
Rudolph,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement official said the truck apparently was not
at the picnic area 18 hours before it was found, meaning that
Rudolph has less than a day's head start on his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said that his troops had been energized by the sighting
of Rudolph. And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph
apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an
avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was
hiding in the familiar woods near his home. ``We've said all along
that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this
area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting
alone,'' Enderson said. ``We still believe that.''
