 &HT;    Manhunt for Rudolph expected to drag on

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Federal law enforcement officers have settled into
what they expect to be a slow and arduous search for Birmingham
bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the searchers concentrated on an area of the Nantahala
Forest near the house Rudolph's family moved into when he was 14,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mechanics in Atlanta were examining a 1977 Nissan
pickup truck, trying to determine how far Rudolph may have driven
it. The truck was taken from an elderly Nantahala man the night of
July 9 and abandoned nearby with two flat tires on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having experts examine it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of
the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   George Nordmann, 71, reported the truck and about six months of
food stolen on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Near Nordmann's home, which has been a focal point of the
renewed searching in the past week, investigators found an
observation point and a campsite. They believe Rudolph watched
Nordmann's residence for several days. His thumbprint has been
identified on a food wrapper at the observation point,
investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also were trying to determine if a boot print
matched the Danner boots Rudolph bought from a Nantahala outlet,
they said. But the boots are a popular brand, worn by many hikers
and even by searchers for Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph had not been seen since Jan. 30, the day after the
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police
officer and severely injured a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are moving slowly, partly for fear of booby traps,
officers said. Agents want to question Rudolph in three bombings in
Atlanta _ the July 1996 explosion in Centennial Olympic Park and
the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and a gay
nightclub. Investigators believe those bombs may have targeted
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working systematically very, very hard in arduous
conditions,'' Killorin said. ''This is what we know. The man is in
the area. We've confirmed that. Absolutely, we're very careful
because this person is wanted for a homicide bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information about Rudolph can call 1-888-283-2662.
