<HEADLINE> Rudolph Not Ruled Out in N.C. Blast </HEADLINE>

	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal investigators said Monday that  
they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric 
Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but 
they aren't ruling him out, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb partially detonated on Saturday morning outside the  
Femcare Clinic in Asheville, about 75 miles west of the mountains 
where agents have been searching for Rudolph for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt in the blast, which caused little damage other  
than leaving black marks on the outside of the one-story brick 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work  
of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said. ``It is too 
early, of course, to draw any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Fox, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, said the powerful bomb could have ``devastated the entire 
end of the building and gone into the building approximately 40 to 
60 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a  
Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police 
officer and severely wounded a nurse. He is charged in that bombing 
and three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that 
killed one person.
