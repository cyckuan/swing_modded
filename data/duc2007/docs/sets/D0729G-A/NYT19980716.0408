   ANDREWS, N.C._Nine days after Eric Robert Rudolph walked out of
the Western North Carolina mountains in search of food and
batteries, law enforcement officials equipped with the latest in
gadgetry still have not been able to track the Birmingham bombing
suspect to his rugged hideout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 local, state and federal officials from North
Carolina, Georgia and Alabama were on the ground Thursday,
searching a 30-square-mile area for the experienced survivalist.
The renewed search has rapidly expanded since Rudolph showed up at
the Nantahala residence of an acquaintance July 7 with a list of
provisions he needed and $500 in cash to pay for them with.
Although investigators found a spot where they believe Rudolph
watched the home of George Nordmann, 71, for several days, the
fugitive has vanished again, leaving no trail.

   ``Obviously, he's pretty good at it,'' Macon County Sheriff
Homer Holbrooks said.

<P>
   Bob Scott, a member of the North Carolina Civil Air Patrol and
an experienced tracker, said searchers at times have spent months
looking for a single lost airplane in the area.

   ``In one case, we lost a pretty good sized single engine Cessna
airplane for 18 months and it was 50 yards from a main highway,''
Scott said. ``They bend the trees and make a canopy. That's what
he's got right now_a canopy.''
</P>
<P>
   The dry weather also hinders the bloodhounds, investigators
said. Dampness holds in the scent.

   Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force had been
``re-energized'' after Nordmann came forward Saturday with his
report of seeing Rudolph. He told them Rudolph stole his 1977
Datsun pickup truck on July 9 and took about six months' worth of
food. Since that time, other ``solid leads'' have come in from the
community, but Woody Enderson, FBI inspector in charge of the task
force, would not characterize the tips. ``We are not going to talk
about exact locations of the search, details about witnesses and
what they have told us, or the exact operations that are going on
right now,'' Enderson said. ``Eric Rudolph is still considered
armed and dangerous. He has specialized knowledge that makes him
especially dangerous in the heavily wooded areas where we are
looking.''
