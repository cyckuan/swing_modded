<HEADLINE> Rudolph Task Force To Disband  </HEADLINE>

   ANDREWS, N.C. (AP) -- The task force that has hunted serial
bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its
command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric Rudolph has not escaped justice, he has just delayed
it,'' Steven McCraw, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said
Monday. ''The trail is cold, yet all evidence suggests he's here,
he's alone and he's alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,
including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion
that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that
performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Birmingham bombing, a truck seen near the
explosion site was traced to Rudolph. Rudolph rented a video in
Murphy, N.C., that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies
and vanished. His truck was found near here several days later.
</P>
<P>
   But dogs, searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have
failed to find Rudolph, an Army veteran and survivalist, in the
dense mountain forests. Agents stopped actively searching in the
woods in August, after McCraw took the job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCraw said in his first public appearance since then that he's
leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C.
Agents will remain in Andrews, and a local coordinator will report
to FBI officials in Atlanta, McCraw said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his
disappearance, in July 1998. McCraw said Rudolph may have been
involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the
perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to
his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe
Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals. Others say he
might have left the region.
