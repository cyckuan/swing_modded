<HEADLINE> Poll: White House, Starr Go Too Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Americans
think Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has gone too far
investigating President Bill Clinton, while about the same number
feel the White House, too, has gone overboard by leaking details
on people involved.
</P>
<P>
A poll by Newsweek magazine released Saturday says 48 percent
of the nation believes Starr has exceeded his mandate and should
be removed.
</P>
<P>
The poll also says, however, that 46 percent agree the Clinton
administration is obstructing justice and has spent too much time
leaking negative information about investigators and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of those polled believe Linda Tripp's main
motivation in secretly taping her conversations with Ms. Monica
Lewinsky was to get attention or make money through a book deal.
