	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors have asked the  
federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President 
Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of 
Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors filed the request with U.S. District Judge  
Norma Holloway Johnson, unidentified sources told The (Baltimore) 
Sun on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury is considering whether Mrs. Tripp broke  
Maryland law by recording conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. If tried 
and convicted, she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 
fine. Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House 
intern's affair with President Clinton. In return, she received a 
federal grant of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has tried unsuccessfully  
since July to obtain the tapes, which remain in Starr's custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli must establish independently that Mrs. Tripp made  
the tapes and knew that taping Ms. Lewinsky without her knowledge 
was illegal. Mrs. Tripp has declined to acknowledge publicly 
whether she made them.
