<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp To Return to Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under criminal investigation in Maryland,  
Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than 
the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings 
triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs specialist in the Defense  
Department's Manpower Data Center, two people familiar with the 
matter said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at the Pentagon in  
a meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of defense  
information, confirmed the meeting, but said he had no other 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Coughter, a spokesman for Mrs. Tripp, declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Until her tapes launched the probe of President Clinton, Mrs.  
Tripp was director of the high-profile Joint Civilian Orientation 
Conference. The program for the secretary of defense brought 
together opinion leaders from across the nation to familiarize them 
with activities of all the military services. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from home since the scandal erupted, the 19-year federal  
employee has had a difficult relationship with her employer, 
declaring she wanted to remain at her work station at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon concluded her presence would be disruptive to the  
Defense Department, so she was assigned to put together a training 
manual from home. She worked in the White House during the Bush and 
early years of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's tape-recorded phone calls of Ms. Lewinsky  
discussing a planned cover-up of her affair with Clinton are the 
focal point of a probe by a Maryland prosecutor of whether she 
broke the state wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
	She says the probe is politically motivated.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent  
counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland 
prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and 
her sworn testimony to Starr.
