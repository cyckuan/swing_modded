	Excerpts of deposition testimony by Monica Lewinsky and Vernon  
Jordan, introduced by House prosecutors Thursday:	
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... your meeting with Vernon Jordan on Dec. 31, 1997. Was  
that to go back and talk about the job again?''	
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but ... for me, the point of that  
meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't 
returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way 
... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp 
testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never 
disclosed that to the president. So that was sort of my intention 
in meeting with Mr. Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little 
information and that would get passed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt  
Hotel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and  
your job search?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing  
New Year's Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Specifically about some notes that you had at your  
apartment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes. That was really in relation to discussing  
Linda Tripp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I  
was acting on behalf of the President to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I think, congressman, if in fact the president of the United  
States' secretary calls and asks for a request, that you try to do 
the best you can to make it happen. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I interpreted it as a request from the president. ...  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he  
asked others to help. I think that is clear from everybody's grand 
jury testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``The fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``You're acting in behalf of the president when you are  
trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the 
job search?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And on either of these conversations that I've referenced,  
that you had with the president after the witness list came out, 
your conversation on 12-7 and your conversation sometime after the 
11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica Lewinsky was on 
the witness list in the Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``He did not.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Would you have expected the president to tell you if he had  
any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky would be called as a 
witness in the Paula Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``That would have been helpful.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... So it would have been helpful, and it was something you  
would have expected?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... And yet, according to your testimony, the president did  
not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness 
list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on two 
occasions, on 12-7 and 12-11?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A: ``I have no recollection of the president telling me about  
the witness list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``I was keeping him (the president) informed about what  
was going on, and so I told him. ... He was obviously interested in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``Mr. President, she signed the affidavit, she signed  
the affidavit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``It is clear, based on the evidence here, that I was at  
the Park Hyatt on Dec. 31. So I do not deny, despite my testimony 
before the grand jury, that on 12-31 that I was there with Ms. 
Lewinsky, but I did testify before the grand jury that I did not 
remember having a breakfast with her on that date, and that was the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``I am certain that Ms. Lewinsky talked to me about  
notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``(So you) talked to her both about the job and her concern  
about parts of the affidavit?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``That is correct.''
