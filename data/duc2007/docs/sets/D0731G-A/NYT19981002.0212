   ``It was so weird. It was really weird. Like really weird.'' _
Monica Lewinsky's vivid description to Linda Tripp of an encounter
with ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   This is ridiculous. They're ridiculous. We're ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between
confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they
scrolled across the newswire Friday? Why was I eagerly sifting
through the garbage of these transcripts and then sending choice
snippets to colleagues and friends?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Just because you wear a red sweater does not mean you
have to wear red lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: OK. I'm just trying to ...
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I wouldn't ever wear red lipstick to see him.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Good.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't exactly Nixon and Haldeman discussing hush money and
cover-ups, now is it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put this in another context. If you were sitting in a
restaurant and Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky were at the next
table, having these exact conversations, you'd be rolling your eyes
and yelping: ``CHECK!''
</P>
<P>
   Picture it now. Two unpleasant people, dominating and dragging
down the room. Tripp, sucking on a Marlboro Light and making a
circular hand-motion to the waiter, indicating she'd like another
vodka tonic for herself and a cosmopolitan for her friend;
Lewinsky, seething quietly because they were supposed to share the
creme brulee as a split dessert, but Linda totally monopolized the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   And they're yapping. Loudly discussing Monica's older, married
boyfriend, the one she calls ``the creep,'' among other nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   They're obsessed. Pathetic. Annoying. Obnoxious. Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: And then I'm gonna wear the navy dress I wore to the
radio address that still has the (REDACTED) on it for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Well, how _ you're what, you're gonna get it cleaned?
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, God.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, I mean, like I haven't worn it for a year, you
know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: It's about time. Out with the old, you know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, that's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I know ...
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: See, I think I would suggest another outfit for the radio
address that makes you _ I mean, for the radio address _ for the
Thanksgiving that makes you look so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, that dress _ I don't care about pretty; I care
about thin. That's all I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check PLEASE!'' I feel as if the entire country should be
calling for the check right now, trying to escape as quickly as
possible from the hellish feeding trough known as Washington, D.C.,
where they continue to work themselves into a dither over this
stupid affair. Enough!
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by
Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to
know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed
evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, expect the Clinton camp to emerge as the
beneficiaries as the strategy backfires. Once again, expect an odd
groundswell of sympathy and support for the president and
especially the first lady in the wake of this release. Tripp's
plotting and Lewinsky's whining does nothing to enhance the
argument of those who favor impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous. What, the
country should be put on hold while government leaders hold
hearings in which they'll rehash the minute details of stained
dresses, cigars and sexual quirks _ and now these chirpy
conversations about lipstick and ``beard burn''?
</P>
<P>
   All those in favor of this entire mess going away forever, say
``Aye.''
</P>
<P>
   All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry,
unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain
to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.
