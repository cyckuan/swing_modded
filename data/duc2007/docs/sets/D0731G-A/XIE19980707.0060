<HEADLINE> Tripp Makes Third Testimony Appearance </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Linda Tripp, whose secret
recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal
investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her
third day of testimony.

Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a
detailed account of her contact with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.

<P>
Phil Coughter, a spokesman for Tripp's lawyers, says he doesn't
know whether this grand jury appearance will be her last in the
investigation of possible perjury, obstruction and witness
tampering.

Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating an alleged
presidential affair and cover-up. Starr's spokesman, Charles
Bakaly, said over the weekend that the grand jury has been asking
a lot of questions and that Starr is moving the probe along as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand
jury. The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly
recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern
confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
