MANY AMERICANS AREN'T BUYING TRIPP'S SELF-IMAGE

<P>
   It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp. Some
of the opinions are favorable. Most are not.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Tripp's claim that she's a victim of the
Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal didn't win her much sympathy. And
Tripp's assertion that she epitomizes the ``average American''
didn't go over with average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this after writing an anti-Tripp column that found
its way into a number of newspapers around the country; reader
reaction has been vociferous, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The letters and phone calls are still coming in, but readers so
far have sided with me by a 3-to-1 ratio. Actual ``average
Americans'' clearly don't have much use for somebody who would
tape-record private conversations with a friend and use the tapes
to make the friend a target in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Tripp did to Monica Lewinsky, the former White
House intern who says she had a sexual relationship with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg _ who said she
urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy _ teamed to
expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr
and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment
lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving
Clinton and Lewinsky _ not to mention the accompanying media frenzy
_ directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations
with Lewinksy.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was one of the instigators of the situation that is
supposedly victimizing her. She set out to implicate her ``friend''
Lewinsky and the president, even going so far as to brief Jones'
attorneys to help them ambush Clinton with questions about Lewinsky
when the president gave his sworn deposition in the sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Tripp stood on the steps of the courthouse after
testifying before Starr's federal grand jury last month and
declared: ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing herself as ``an average American who found herself in
a situation not of her own making,'' Tripp whined about her
treatment at the hands of TV comics and ``legions of paid
prevaricators.''
</P>
<P>
   I opined that Tripp not only asked to be in the position she's
in, she demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   One reader left a message on the voice mail informing me that
the column was ``way off base.'' One said the column was ``very
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is ``taking a very bad rap,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reading your opinion on Linda Tripp,'' wrote a
Pennsylvania reader, ``it is obvious to me you are one of the 90
percent liberal media, reporting things your way and the hell with
right, wrong or the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers were in the minority, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the rare times that I've ever agreed with
you,'' one like-minded citizen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right on,'' said another. ``Write more articles like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to agree _ Linda Tripp is no victim by any means,''
wrote a reader from Highland, Ind. ``And this is an average
American's point of view: President Clinton is on my time, right
now. Let him do his job. I don't care who he sleeps with.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was this from a reader in San Luis Obispo, Calif.: ``I
thoroughly enjoyed your column on Linda Tripp. Ken Starr was
searching for a deceitful person to help him in his endeavor and he
most certainly found one.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired Air Force veteran from Trinity, N.C., added that Tripp
``deserves everything that is thrown at her _ her security
clearance should have been pulled, she should be run out of the
Pentagon, fired, and barred from ever working for the government
again. ... All this taping was about a multimillion-dollar book
deal, not the security of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg says that Tripp is not hawking a book. But it's hard to
believe that there won't be one, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a question: If she writes a book, who's gonna buy it?
