WHAT LINDA TRIPP REALLY DESERVES IS ...

<P>
   It was one of those moments that burrows deep into the memory
but readily scurries to the surface whenever we hear the name. Who
can forget Linda Tripp standing in front of the TV cameras and
assuring the American people: ``I'm you. 'm just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like who? Not me. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I don't know anyone who's just like Linda Tripp. I am
exceedingly grateful for that.
</P>
<P>
   Linda ``Just Like You'' Tripp now stands accused of a crime, a
minor one to be sure: tape-recording a telephone conversation
without the other party's knowledge or permission. But the
ramifications were far more serious.
</P>
<P>
   By illegally taping her conversations with ex-friend Monica
Lewinsky _ and blabbing about the contents of the tapes to Newsweek
magazine and independent counsel Ken Starr _ Tripp almost brought
down the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Which must have been a tremendous disappointment for Tripp and
her Clinton-hating pal, New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg. It
was Goldberg, as devotees of the White House sex-and-lies scandal
surely recall, who advised Tripp to record those telephone
heart-to-hearts in which Lewinsky revealed her sexual encounters
with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes bought Tripp 15 minutes of fame, a federal immunity
deal with the independent counsel's office, an extended visit with
Starr's grand jury _ and a long-term role as a punch line in Jay
Leno's ``Tonight Show'' monologues.
</P>
<P>
   They also bought her this criminal charge in the state of
Maryland, which took exception to her violations of its laws
against wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing is being conducted this week to determine if
Maryland authorities have sufficient grounds to put Tripp on trial.
Tripp, oddly enough, has been saying that she wants to stand trial
because she remains convinced that she did the right thing when she
pushed the ``record'' button on her tape machine.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's son, Ryan Tripp, attended Thursday's court session and
was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that he wanted his mom
to be tried so that she ``can be completely vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Vindication, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp didn't attend _ ``She's got to work for a living,''
Ryan said _ and so she missed the opportunity to stare down
Lewinsky as the president's former, uh, girlfriend testified for
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp may get another chance to confront the former White House
intern. Lewinsky will be a key witness if the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial is a decision to be made by a judge,
as we know, but just about everyone else is allowed to weigh in on
another question: Should the case go to trial?
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has her partisans _ I know this because I heard from most
of them the last time I disparaged her in print _ and they insist
that the criminal proceedings in Maryland amount to nothing more
than retaliation for her participation in Starr's investigation of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Can't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   But is the retaliation deserved? Should Tripp pay some sort of
price for breaking an obscure law en route to touching off a
scandal that virtually paralyzed the U.S. government for more than
a year? Should she be held accountable for what may have been a
massive betrayal of a friend's trust but was merely a technical
violation of law?
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is a despicable character, to be sure. For my money, she's
guilty of felonious audacity for making that ``just like you''
comment after her grand jury testimony last year. Calling herself
an ``average American'' was an affront to average Americans, most
of whom would never dream of selling out a friend the way that
Tripp sold out Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But only the most vengeful Clintonista could believe that Tripp
ought to face criminal charges. The scandal is over. Clinton beat
the rap. Why dredge it all up again just to prosecute Tripp for, in
effect, being a jerk?
</P>
<P>
   I say we'd all be better off if the judge would sentence Tripp
to one more year of Leno jokes and let it go at that.
