<HEADLINE> Tripp Wiretapping Case Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland's wiretapping case against
Linda Tripp came to an official end Wednesday as a Howard County
judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors said last week they would ask Circuit Court
Judge Diane Leasure to dismiss the case because of insufficient
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was indicted last July for illegally taping phone
conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The
tapes were used in the investigation that led to the impeachment of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Leasure ruled in December that only one tape could be used in
the case because of immunity granted to Tripp by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Then, in May, the judge ruled that most of
Lewinsky's testimony was tainted and inadmissible. That left
prosecutors unable to prove that the call took place before Tripp's
immunity took effect.
