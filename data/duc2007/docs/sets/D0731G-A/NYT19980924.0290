   WASHINGTON _ The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of
telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released
next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the actual tapes, the Illinois Republican said, the
committee may release an edited transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conversations last year, Lewinsky told Tripp
about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly,
about attempts to cover it up. It was Tripp's decision to give
Starr the tapes that spurred an eight-month investigation that is
now likely to lead to hearings on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Tripp's tapes are very long. They are very garrulous.
There is a lot of information that really does not pertain to this
investigation,'' said Hyde. ``There is information there that
really could be embarrassing to innocent people, third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to alter tapes,'' he explained. ``On the other
hand, there is information that should be released. We can redact
transcripts of the taped material and release those. That, so far,
seems to be the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Hyde's committee questioned whether the real
Republican motive was to withhold evidence that was damaging to
Tripp's motives and methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that if Republicans thought the tapes hurt the
president, they wouldn't hesitate to release them,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said he hadn't heard the tapes and noted that Starr's
report indicated they may have been altered. If there are questions
of authenticity, the FBI should verify the tapes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it makes no sense to release the transcript and not the
tape,'' Nadler said. ``You either release both or you don't release
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing
the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda
Tripp?'' asked Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``The Republicans started
out saying they were going to treat the president like everybody
else. Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed
last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be
consistent. I don't think we're going to be for releasing those
tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be
released.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said withholding the Tripp tapes
would continue the pattern of partisanship by the committee's
majority Republicans. Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes,
Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a
fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to
the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding
her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful
Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony. ``And I
hate Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the grand jury testimony, e-mail and other evidence
already released by Congress indicates that Tripp practically
assembled the case before going to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least
partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never
cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual
relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky. Lewinsky said Tripp
``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it
could be evidence one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never
happen. But then ``she told me I looked fat in the dress'' and
loaned her a jacket to wear to an event instead, Lewinsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and
obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job. Lewinsky said
she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has raised suspicions about the audio tapes, noting that
some seem to have been altered or copied. Tripp has denied
duplicating or altering the tapes. It is illegal to tape someone
without their knowledge in Maryland, and a state grand jury is
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to
release the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, frankly, think an impeachment inquiry takes precedence over
the grand jury in Maryland,'' he explained. ``The information that
should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that
shouldn't go out.''
