PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Associations for the unemployed
in France announced Wednesday that they will hold another
nationwide protest on Saturday. Thousands of protesters
demonstrated in Paris and other cities on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four associations of anti-unemployment militants blamed the
government for failing to present new proposals to tackle the 12.4
percent unemployment rate in France, and condemned France's
employers for being arrogant toward the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
"The movement should continue. Facing the arrogance of the
employers, the silence of the UNEDIC (Union Nationale pour
l'Emploi Dans L'Industrie et le Commerce), and absence of new
proposals from the government, a dynamic should absolutely
continue to find its place," said a communique issued by the
associations.
</P>
<P>
The associations also criticized the Socialist government for
refusing to revise its 1998 budget to raise the minimum
unemployment aid the RMI, and to grant aid to unemployed under the
age of 25.
