PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The French government Saturday
announced several emergency measures to support the jobless
people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84
million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry said at a
press conference that the government will present a law on helping
unemployed people before Summer this year, in which a series of
measures will be taken in the fields of housing, health care and
school.
</P>
<P>
She also promised to continue holding talks with unions and
anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the
government in favor of jobless people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government ordered the local governments in
prefectures to solve case by case the job problems of people
living in distress, and asked them to maintain "emergency cells"
responsible for tackling unemployment.
</P>
<P>
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which
means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population
are without jobs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 36.89 percent of these people have been seeking jobs
for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed people staged a series of protests from Christmas
through New Year festival by occupying the offices of government
agencies in charge of unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
Since these emergency cells were set up by the end of December,
2,000 cases of jobless people in distress have been reviewed and
700 of them have been given "positive responses" on finding a job,
said the government.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the number of jobs offered increased
by 20 percent from November 1996 to November 1997, while the
number of lay-offs decreased by 17 percent.
