<HEADLINE> Waigel Admits Germany Might Overshoot Euro Debt Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
admitted today that Germany may slightly overshoot the debt
requirement for joining the planned single European currency --
the Euro, but stressed that other criteria would be strictly
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel
told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left
over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national
debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states
to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP,
Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be
softened.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999
launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU
countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost
certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would
threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is due to be introduced from January 1, 1999.
Countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on
full economic data of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But there remains widespread doubts about the future of the
Euro because both Germany and France, the two country at the heart
of the project, are struggling to meet the qualification criteria,
mainly due to their sluggish economic growth and the cost for
financing benefits for record high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
France has openly asked for a softening in the interpretation
of the qualification terms of the Euro but Germany has so far
insisted on strict adherence.
