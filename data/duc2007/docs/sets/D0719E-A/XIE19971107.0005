<HEADLINE> Agreement Elusive on European Employment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks prior to the
European Union (EU) job summit, ministers in the European Council
still seem far from agreeing on how to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers spent a long Wednesday airing their sometimes
poles-apart views while discussing the guidelines for member
states employment policies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's discussions concluded without an expected press
conference, and the discussion continued today for what looked
likely to be another prolonged working day for the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was said to be held with consensus that the
problem of unemployment has to be solved through entrepreneurship,
employability, adaptability and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that they have to move toward concrete and
quantifiable commitments for the guidelines which will be
delivered to the job summit. The summit later this month will be
in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
At stake will be how much each member state has to pay to
create a combined total of 25 million more jobs, if the union is
to solve the biting issue of unemployment which now runs at an
average high of 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is as high as 19.2 percent in Spain, 12.6 percent
in both Finland and France and 10.7 percent in Ireland. Though
the journal of European Report said that unemployment in Germany
was at 9.6 percent, the country itself announced its fifth
post-war record high of 11.7 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The EU is already paying 200 billion ECU (229 billion
U.S. dollars) each year in unemployment allowances.
</P>
<P>
One EU spokesperson said the union was not calling for extra
expenditure on unemployment allowances. It was calling for
priorities to be offered in youth employment and long-term
employment.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, in charge of employment
and social affairs, said earlier this week that the shared task of
the ministers was to ensure that the EU did not remain the zone of
high unemployment as it had been for much of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is dedicating the present week as employment week, and
discussions and meetings are focused on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But observers here were left with the impression that before
the job summit, the questions of how much to pay in unemployment
allowances and in creating more jobs might still remain "a hard
nut to crack."
