French poor, jobless protest for more benefits

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of jobless demonstrated across France on
Monday to press the Socialist-led government for a bigger increase
in unemployment benefits and a Christmas bonus.
	   Protests were staged in some 60 cities throughout the country
against a 3 percent rise in unemployment benefits announced by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week, which jobless associations
say is too small.
	   In Paris, about 400 people occupied the headquarters of French
insurance firm AXA to protest against poverty and homelessness in
general, unfurling a banner reading ``War on Poverty''.
	   Claire Villiers, of Act Together against Unemployment (AC!),
said the protesters had singled out ``a very big financial company,
as poverty grows in our country and the government is leaning
toward measures to reduce taxes for the rich.''
	   In the southwestern city of Toulouse, jobless and homeless
groups called for ``a day of action against poverty'', staging
protests at the Matabiau rail station and the local government
representative's office to demand emergency housing and benefits
and free transport for the poor and unemployed.
	   More demonstrations were planned in Toulouse later in the day.
	   In the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, some 200 people
showed up at the doors of the regional council building demanding
that local officials hear them out.
	   Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around
11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been
seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the
occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
