This brought the minimum unemployment benefit with a system of
degressivity to 142.24 francs (27.3 U.S. dollars) a day.
Meanwhile, the UNEDIC raised the amount of the "floor" of
unemployment benefit, below which the degressivity system can no
longer apply, by 4 percent to 92.21 francs (17.7 U.S. dollars) a
day.
