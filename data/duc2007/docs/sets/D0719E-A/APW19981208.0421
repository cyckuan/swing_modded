	   PARIS (AP) _ Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in
southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping
pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000
francs (dlrs 535).
	   The jobless protest, which started in the southern port of
Marseille, has spread to Aix-en-Provence and Martigues, where
activists occupied a total of eight unemployment offices Tuesday
morning.
	   In addition, about 15 jobless were protesting in an unemployment
office in the Parisian suburb of Villejuif.
	   Meanwhile, police in Marseille evacuated two unemployment
offices Tuesday morning, moving about 300 protesters into the
streets.
	   Officials in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone region said Tuesday
they would decide ``before Christmas'' on a way to obtain financial
aid for the jobless. They were to hold a meeting later Tuesday.
	   The movement is similar to one that took place in France last
December, with unemployed workers demanding a bonus in order to be
able to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays.
	   Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one billion francs
(dlrs 178 million) to help the needy.
	   Jobless activists say 15 billion francs is needed to help the
jobless this year.
	   Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7
percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high
jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
