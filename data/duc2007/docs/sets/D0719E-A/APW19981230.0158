	   PARIS (AP) _ France's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5
percent in November, but nearly 3 million people remain without a
job, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
	   The number of unemployed fell to 2,940,800 in November down
4,700 from October, the Labor Ministry said. The jobless rate in
October had been 11.6 percent.
	   Young people less than 25 years old were the main winners,
although jobless over 50 also managed to find work, the ministry
said.
	   Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with
joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed
to a rise in crime and violence.
