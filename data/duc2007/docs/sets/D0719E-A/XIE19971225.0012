<HEADLINE> Unemployment Haunts France This Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The 12.5 percent unemployment
rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and
unionists staged several protests over the past week against
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry
Thursday urged the prefectural governments to take care of the
unemployed people "in distress" and solve some "emergency cases."
</P>
<P>
French unions, including the Confederation Generale du
Travaile, joined the protests for the first time on Wednesday
organized by unemployed workers in Paris, demanding a Christmas
bonus of 3,000 to 5,000 francs (500 to 840 U.S. dollars) for each
unemployed worker.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment insurance agency UNEDIC had to close
its door in Paris Wednesday because of protest activities.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests were staged on the same day in Havre in
northern France and in Marseille, and police forced some 40
unemployed people out of an occupied mayoral office building of a
district in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The workers of a Mercedes d'Etoile automobile plant in Valence
in southeast France staged a strike on that day to support their
manager, who was said to have been fired by the superiors for
keeping the workers on the job.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as big shops reported better Christmas shoppings this
year than the last, the question is also centered on social
disparity in France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberte de l'Est said that one can cite a long list
of social conflicts from unemployment to homelessness at this
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Berry Republicain said that Christmas now remains
only as a "reserve of remote impressions of fairy-tales," and the
daily L'Humanite said that the seemingly rising prosperity as is
shown remains to be proved yet.
</P>
<P>
While preparing a law on social solidarity to be presented in
February, the government is studying a proposal by the Communist
Party to subsidize a 1,500 francs (260 U.S. dollars) social aid
for each unemployed workers who are more than 55 years old.
