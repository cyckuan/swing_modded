 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike on Paris line after attack

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers were on strike in several cities on
Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public
transportation across France, officials said.
	   The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille,
Lille and Chambery, officials said.
	   The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the
west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a
train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on
Sunday.
	   A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a fire
extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the driver to
be hospitalized. On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45
minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
	   Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the
southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout,
officials said. The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked
on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
	   Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille
bus drivers, who began returning to work Monday. But employee
representatives said they would halt service after each attack in
France's second-largest city.
	   Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the
northern city of Lille _ France's fourth-largest metropolis _ and
for a 10th day in the Alpine city of Chambery.
	   Transit workers have demanded that the government put more
police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the
violence.
	   The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from
working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit
unemployment rate. While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the
rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods.
