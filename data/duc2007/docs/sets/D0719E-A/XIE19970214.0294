<HEADLINE> OECD Calls on France to Adopt More Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua)-- The OECD report said that the
labor costs for low-skilled workers in France are too high, and
recommended that wage flexibility should be raised, including
reforming the country's minimum wage system, the SMIC.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that the role of minimum wage "as a distributive
instrument" be reassessed with the objective of increasing
employment opportunities, and that the minimum wage be
differentiated by age and region.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system
of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of
France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of
unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system,
replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained
relatively high for low income earners," it said.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in
France be solved through "making the country's benefit system
less generous."
</P>
<P>
The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass
lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of
job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the
flexibility of work schedules.
</P>
<P>
It said that the costs of mass layoffs and the time they take
to implement are "substantial" in France, and that some
collective agreements on employment contain "stringent
obligations which can severely hamper the pace of restructuring."
</P>
<P>
It also regretted that while French enterprises can lay off
workers out of economic difficulties, they cannot legally do this
simply for obtaining economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since 1992, the supply of part-time jobs
has risen substantially in France, where part-time employment was
underdeveloped by comparison with other OECD countries in the
past.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that working hour flexibility for full-time
workers is "not as yet very developed" in France, even though
the relevant legislation has been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, agreements providing for greater flexibility
compensated by an overall reduction in working hours have been
allowed, but little progress in striking such agreements has
actually been made," it said.
