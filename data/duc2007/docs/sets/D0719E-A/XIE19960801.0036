<HEADLINE> France's Unemployment Rises Again in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless in France rose
by 22,800 in June, which registered a 0.7 percent increase over
the previous month and a 4.6 percent rise over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics published today by the French Ministry
of Labor, the total number of jobless in France now stands at
3,065,600, or 12.5 percent of the working age population of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said in a report for its Thursday edition that the
rise of unemployment in June was partly attributed to the season,
when a large number of youths graduating from school in summer
entered the job market.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that the economic climate in France remains
bad, with a near-zero growth or even below-zero growth in the
April-May-June period of 1996, said the local daily.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June
has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment
situation, with "rigidity in budget policy and decline in social
plans risking to push down a revival."
</P>
<P>
"For the year, the forecasts of specialists are not in the
least encouraging. The National Institution of Statistics and
Economics Study expects a 12.3-12.5 percent unemployment rate,
while the French Observatory of Economic Circumstances expects an
unemployed population of 140,000 by the end of the year and
120,000 in the following year," said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs
Jacques Barrot said today that the government will subsidize 15-20
billion francs (3-4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to finance
employment programs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialist Party said the rise of unemployment
underlines the failure of government policy.
</P>
<P>
"Far from taking the seriousness of the employment situation
into its conscience, the government is taking measures which will
accentuate the tendency towards the rising of unemployment," said
Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande.
</P>
<P>
He listed as examples of government errors reduction of
allocations for the new school year, lay-offs in public sectors
and reduction of social plans in the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Applied Macro-Economic Analysis (GAMA) said today
that the French economy will have a growth of 1.4-1.5 percent in
the whole year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic growth dropped by 0.3 percent in the
April-May-June period, it will grow by 0.9 percent and 1 percent
in the next two quarters of the year, said GAMA.
