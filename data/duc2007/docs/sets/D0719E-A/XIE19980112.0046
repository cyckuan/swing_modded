<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Government to Avoid Excluding the Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Monday that the government should be ``particularly careful''
about the problem of social exclusion, which results from long
time unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The social cohesion of France is now being threatened by
unemployment, exclusion and violence in urban suburbs, the
president said in response to escalating protests by the
unemployed during a meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have vowed to continue their fight despite aid
packages offered by the Socialist government to help jobless
persons in desperate situations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the law against exclusion, which will be
presented by the government to the National Assembly in March,
will ``attack the roots of the evil in all fields,''
including unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the government turn the money subsidized for
social aid programs into investment for jobs.
</P>
<P>
France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with
a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been
unemployed for more than a year.
