<HEADLINE> Frenchmen Sensitive about Poverty, Exclusion: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The fight against poverty and
social exclusion is considered by Frenchmen and Frenchwomen as the
second most important issue of the country after unemployment,
said a poll published by the newspaper "Le Croix" today.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the SOFRES polling group on August
28-30 on 1,000 people who are above 18 and from different social
groups.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of people aged between 18 and 24 say that
they think about poverty and exclusion from time to time, while 34
percent of people above 66 say that they never think about
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Only 9 percent of the members of working class say they never
think about poverty and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two percent of the polled say they personally know
someone who is living in poverty or is in the danger of falling
into poverty. Six years ago, 49 percent of Frenchmen said they
knew personally someone who was living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of people say that to have five million poor
people in France is something unacceptable, while 20 percent say
that they feel "disarmed and powerless" in front of the problem
of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-four percent of the Communist Party members polled say
the state has not done enough for the poor, while most of the
members of rightist groups and Catholic communities say the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent people say that unemployment of long
duration is the principal cause of poverty, followed by the lack
of development of job market, and lack of solidarity among people
as other causes of poverty.
