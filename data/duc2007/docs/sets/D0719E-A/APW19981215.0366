Jospin takes offensive, calls for increase in jobless allowance

	   PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin went on the
offensive Tuesday, calling for an increase in social allowances to
end jobless protests and accusing President Jacques Chirac of
borrowing his ideas.
	   The Socialist prime minister in recent weeks has wrestled with
labor unrest, jobless demonstrations and discord within his
government, just as the conservative Chirac has seen his popularity
ratings soar.
	   In a radio and television interview, Jospin said his government
has decided to raise two welfare allowances by 3 percent Jan. 1 to
ease the plight of France's unemployed. The increases will be
retroactive to Jan. 1, 1998.
	   Jospin was responding to recent protests across the country by
thousands of jobless demanding a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end
bonus.
	   Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7
percent, reflecting a slight improvement in the country's high
jobless rate.
	   Jospin said that Chirac, who has raised his profile in recent
weeks, has ``borrowed a lot'' from his government, particularly
regarding reform of the justice system, term limits and equal
representation of women in politics.
	   Jospin also said that although his government is still targeting
a 2.7 percent growth rate for France's gross domestic product in
1999, this goal will be hard to reach because of uncertainties on
the world global market.
	   In 1998, he said, France will post 3 percent growth, ``maybe
even 3.1 percent.''
	   Recent opinion polls have shown Chirac gaining in popularity and
even beating Jospin in a presidential election with 53 percent of
the vote.
	   Chirac, the leader of the moderate-right Rally for the Republic
party, was forced to share power with Jospin, a Socialist, when he
lost his majority in legislative elections in 1997.
