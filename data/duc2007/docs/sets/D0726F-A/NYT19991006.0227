 &HT;    GORE OPENS NASHVILLE HEADQUARTERS, DECLARES ``NEW DAY'' IN HIS
CAMPAIGN

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore declared ``a new day''
in his presidential bid Wednesday with a symbolic homecoming and
the opening of a new campaign headquarters far from the constant
political intrigue and daily odds-making of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is where we start from,'' Gore told the nearly 300 people
who gathered in the asphalt parking lot of the office building that
will serve as his campaign headquarters as he tries to rejuvenate a
White House bid that has not gone according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife Tipper and his 87-year-old mother Pauline at his
side, the vice president said, ``Home is not only a place _ it's an
idea ... Home is where we learn our values. It's where we turn to
remember ourselves in the best sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the new headquarters building, across the street from
Nashville's Centennial Medical Center, once served as a
rehabilitation center. And Gore 2000 officials readily acknowledged
that the campaign needs rehabilitation in the wake of a stronger
than expected challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to do that, they said, than in Tennessee,
the state Gore represented in Congress for 16 years before being
elected vice president on the ticket with Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee has a tremendous amount of pride in Al Gore and he
connects with people in Tennessee,'' said Tony Coelho, the chairman
of Gore's presidential campaign. ``There will be a great deal of
enthusiasm and support for him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, newly appointed campaign manager Donna Brazile said
Tennesseans will be recruited in the coming weeks to make political
pilgrimages to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states with the
first voting in the Democratic presidential contest next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'Tennessee Travelers' are going to tell everybody in Iowa
and New Hampshire what Al Gore is all about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a dark horse for the Democratic nomination in
1976, used a similar tactic, sending hundreds of Georgians to the
early primary states. They called themselves the ``Peanut
Brigade,'' in honor of Carter's background as a peanut farmer.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of enthusiasm for Gore was absent in Washington, 550
miles away, Coelho acknowledged. ``Inside the Beltway, they are a
little jaded about presidential candidates,'' he added. ``That's
why a lot of presidential campaigns are run from local areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Gore's campaign had been run from high-rent
offices on K Street in Washington, the corridor favored by the
lobbying and law firms that wield so much influence in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in one of the more dramatic actions of his campaign,
Gore announced that he was moving the operation ``from K Street in
Washington to the aisles of Kmart in Nashville'' in an effort to
get the attention of average voters.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Kmart near his new headquarters on the west side of
downtown Nashville, Gore's decision to run his presidential
campaign from Tennessee was widely praised by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to stand up for the working families in this
country,'' said William Moorman, a 48-year-old blue collar employee
of British Petroleum, who was dropping off film at the Kmart. ``I
guess that's what he's trying to do. There's just too much money
influencing things in Washington,'' added Moorman, who described
himself as an ``independent'' voter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that the campaign move is little more
than a stunt by a presidential candidate who, as vice president,
senator, congressman and the son of a senator, has spent virtually
his entire life in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tennesseans who came to watch Gore cut the ribbon on his
new headquarters have always viewed the vice president as one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of us, always has been,'' said Deedie Drake, an
elderly woman from Murfreesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is often mocked for his formality, continued to
project a more relaxed style at Wednesday's ceremonies, though he
promised a ``rip-tootin' campaign'' against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was dressed in a blue sports shirt, khaki pants and cowboy
boots. Most staff members were similarly casual.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Gore campaign is anything but casual in trying
to shift its massive political operation from Washington to
Nashville. Brazile said the Nashville site will not be fully
operational until the middle of October.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, Brazile and Carter Eskew, the media consultant hired to
help develop Gore's campaign message, are already working out of
the Nashville office. But there still is no final word on how many
of the 90-member campaign staff in Washington would move to
Tennessee.
