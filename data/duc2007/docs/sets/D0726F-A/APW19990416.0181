<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Picks Political Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's 2000 campaign has  
appointed a campaign pro with local Washington connections as its 
political director. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Brazile, chief of staff and press secretary for Del.  
Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, was national 
field director for Rep. Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign. 
She also works as a consultant to the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, as she did in the 1996 and 1998 campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is an at-large member of Democratic National Committee  
and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore's political director and deputy campaign manager, she  
will be responsible for political outreach efforts, including 
lining up endorsements and delegates within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been criticized within the party -- mostly by women's  
groups -- for lacking more women in his inner circle of advisers. 
Brazile will join Tina Flournoy, the campaign's finance chairwoman, 
as the second black woman in a senior role.
