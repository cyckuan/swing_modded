<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Major Campaign Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua ) -- U.S. Vice President Al
Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to
the grass roots and directly to the American people," he told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the new shape of this campaign," Gore said. "This
is a hard, tough fight and I'm going to fight my heart out for
every single vote."
</P>
<P>
The former Tennessee senator, who grew up in Washington, said
he is taking his campaign "lock, stock and barrel" out of the
nation's capital and to downtown Nashville in Tennessee State,
where he will open his new headquarters in a week.
</P>
<P>
Gore's move is expected to cut his campaign staff, which Gore
considered too big, too expensive and too slow to react.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move also will help distance Gore from
President Bill Clinton, whose scandal-plagued administration has
had a negative pull on the vice president's poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore
campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
