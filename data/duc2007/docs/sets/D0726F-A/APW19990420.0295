<HEADLINE> Gore Tours Ohio Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>

	MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore commiserated with  
those who lost their homes and businesses when a killer tornado 
tore through suburban Cincinnati earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was truly inspired by the way everybody pulled together,  
neighbors helping neighbors,'' Gore said Monday. ``I was not fully 
prepared for how much damage there was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president visited the areas worst hit when a pre-dawn  
twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow path through affluent 
subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other communities on April 
9. Four people died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for what you all have been through,'' Gore told  
Laurie Arshonsky, whose home in Montgomery was destroyed. ``You 
people have really suffered through a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Arshonsky showed Gore a handful of jewelry and trinkets  
that she had recovered from the rubble of her home. ``What I'd like 
to do with my garden, I'd like to make it a tornado victory 
garden,'' she told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last several years, I have had the occasion to go to  
several different parts of our country to see the aftermath of 
disasters, and every one is unique and different,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one comparison I would like to make is this: I don't know  
when I've heard more compliments in the aftermath for the response, 
the organization, the hard work, the long hours the way everybody 
has pulled together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of you who lost family members and loved ones will be in  
our hearts and in our prayers,'' Gore said. ``Those who have 
suffered such devastating property losses -- the business owners, 
the homeowners, apartment dwellers and others -- you are in our 
prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insured damage has been put at $66 million by the Ohio Insurance  
Institute; the total uninsured damage has not been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft last week asked President Clinton to approve  
assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for 
families, businesses and local governments in the tornado-damaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is under intensive review right now at FEMA. There should  
be some kind of word on that early this week,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the vice president ate lunch with contributors to his  
2000 presidential campaign and moderated a public forum on 
long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people attended the fund-raiser for Gore, where a  
spokesman for his presidential campaign said the campaign expected 
to net about $150,000 from the visit.
