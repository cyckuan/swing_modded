<HEADLINE> Gore Swings Through New Hampshire </HEADLINE>

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took his  
presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy 
Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore greeted about 70 people in the home of Democratic activist  
and former Mayor Martin Gross. As he did throughout his two-day 
stay in New Hampshire -- site of the first presidential primary in 
2000 -- Gore stressed saving Medicare and Social Security, the 
environment, and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Democratic presidential candidate who has campaigned in  
this house has failed to get elected president at some point,'' 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton visited the residence before placing a welcomed second  
in the 1992 state primary, and Carter came here before winning the 
1976 primary. Gore visited in 1988, when he failed to win the 
Democratic nomination, and now has a second chance, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed a forum on home health care in Portsmouth and  
spoke at a Democratic dinner in Conway on Friday. He spent Saturday 
meeting with voters in homes in Concord, Manchester and Nashua. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of the trip, Gore did what his advisers have been  
wanting him to do: shed his stiff image and talk to people 
one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what he needs to do,'' said Bill Shaheen, his state  
campaign manager and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen's husband. ``He's going 
into real parlors, meeting real people, hearing real questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls have shown that while most Americans are pleased  
with Gore's performance as vice president, they don't see him as a 
strong leader. He has trailed two Republicans, former American Red 
Cross President Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in 
head-to-head matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	But several voters who met Gore this weekend, including lawyer  
Sean O'Connell, said they found Gore more exciting than his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think he's a little wooden, but it's not true,''  
O'Connell said. ``He really can connect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After jogging five miles through Concord -- he runs at least  
three miles a day, according to the Secret Service -- Gore surprised 
customers with a Saturday stop at the Capitol City Diner. He joined 
some diners in their booths and told them he wants to raise the 
minimum wage and help the homeless.
