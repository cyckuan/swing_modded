   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Monday that his chief
of staff, Ron Klain, was resigning to become a partner in the
Washington office of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, a law firm based in Los
Angeles. Gore named Charles Burson, a longtime friend and counsel
in his office and former attorney general of Tennessee, his new
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Klain's departure had been expected for several weeks, since
Gore named Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, general
chairman of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of rifts between Coelho and Klain at the
time, and some Democratic operatives expected Klain to be forced
out. But by the time of Monday's announcement, Klain and others
were saying that Coelho was trying to get Klain to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was doing everything humanly possible to try to get me to
stay,'' Klain said in an interview. But, he said, he had already
decided it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point in time when you need to do something
else,'' Klain said. ``My heart said stay, but my head told me to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers said he told them in a staff meeting that he
was ``like a milk carton, and milk cartons have an expiration
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Klain had realized that ``the center of gravity had
shifted'' from the vice president's office to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Klain was criticized by some Gore allies after President Clinton
called a reporter for The New York Times in May and said Gore
needed to loosen up on the campaign trail. Klain was in the room
when the president decided to make the call. He was blamed later
for what was perceived as a public relations disaster for Gore,
although others in the room had not objected either.
</P>
<P>
   Klain said Monday that he and Coelho still thought the phone
call was a good idea. ``Tony and I may be the only people in
Washington who believe that phone call was a good idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klain, 37, will serve as a senior strategist to the campaign and
will not leave for a few months, he said. He was chief of staff for
Attorney General Janet Reno before becoming Gore's chief of staff
nearly four years ago.
