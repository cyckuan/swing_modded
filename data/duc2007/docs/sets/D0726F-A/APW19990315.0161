<HEADLINE>  Gephardt Endorses Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of  
political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured 
the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 
party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire  
crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop 
in his onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United  
States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the 
presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker 
of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to  
settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on 
winning both the House and White House in November 2000. President 
Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his 
understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced  
challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign  
that catches fire at the grass roots. He is buoyed by evidence of 
potential Gore weakness in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton  
initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New  
Hampshire news conference. Gore said he will ``face entirely new 
challenges, and we need new answers.'' Yet his answers sounded 
familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all 
students and improve health care. Clinton has pressed those ideas, 
but Gore promises to push them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to  
public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 
New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again:  
``Stand with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their  
hands high. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states  
that cast the earliest votes in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political  
trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of 
inevitability about his nomination even before he formally 
announces his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of  
political science at the University of Michigan, said of Gephardt's 
endorsement. ``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the 
nominee. What Gephardt wants is to be speaker -- and it's better to 
be part of a team than to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is  
taking nothing for granted. ``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he 
said. ``I always expect it.'' He promised to return to both states 
to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the  
endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne 
Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still  
neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
offer hints at weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for the 
Republican nomination. Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his 
father's ``failed prescriptions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had 
ruled out voting for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of 
independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider 
voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes. He claimed that  
he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential  
candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him. 
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the 
greatest attention for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.
