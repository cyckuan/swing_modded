EXCLUSIVE: GORE TO ANNOUNCE FORMATION OF CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal
step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal
Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization,
aides to the vice president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said papers would be mailed to the commission Friday
as official confirmation so the organization could begin to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one other Democrat has signaled his intention to
run for president _ former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who has
created an exploratory committee. Gore has decided to skip this
preliminary step to an official announcement of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But other prominent Democrats are expected to test the waters,
as well, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sen. John McCain of Arizona became the first
Republican to announce the formation of an exploratory committee.
Other Republicans, like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
publishing magnate Steve Forbes, have given every indication they
also intend to run.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President Clinton, most recently
as the White House political adviser, has been hired as Gore's
campaign manager, a sign that he intends to draw heavily on people
and grass-roots organizations that helped Clinton become the first
Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win successive terms as
president.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would
also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and
former Gore chief of staff; another former vice presidential chief
of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep.
Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who is one of Gore's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a Clinton-Gore operation for the last six years,
not a Clinton operation and not a Gore operation,'' Smith, 40, said
Thursday in an interview. ``The Clinton years will become the
foundation for Gore to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was on a skiing vacation with his family in Utah, was
not available for comment, and the announcement by his staff
included no statement from him.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many political experts, Gore will enter the 2000
campaign as the leading Democratic candidate, after a political
career that spans eight years as a House member from Tennessee,
eight years in the Senate and six years as vice president. He was
untouched by the Clinton sex scandal, and after a review by the
Justice Department, Attorney General Janet Reno found no reason to
investigate his fund-raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore has access to enormous amounts of money as a
result of countless trips around the country for speeches, which
exposed him to local political leaders and grass-roots
organizations to cement his own ties for the future.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 midterm election campaign, he stumped for
hundreds of Democrats across the country, appearing in more than 30
states in just the final two months of the campaign _ chits that
will no doubt make him the least likely candidate to encounter
problems raising the federal spending limit for 2000, which is
expected to be set at about $35 million. The 1996 limit was $30.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, 50, is not without concerns as the campaign unfolds. A
speaker who often sounds wooden and looks stiff, he has yet to
demonstrate consistently a folksy side that appeals to many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne Conlin, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Iowa, where
the first caucuses are held, said she expected Gore to be the
front-runner. ``But Iowans are pretty sophisticated evaluators,''
she said. ``All candidates, no matter what their title is, have to
sit down in living rooms and talk policy and issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, the outgoing state party chairman in New
Hampshire, site of the first primary, and a Gore supporter said:
``His biggest negative, especially running in the small, early
states, could be his person-to-person approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore could find that many voters, including
Democrats, are turned off by a candidate aligned so closely to a
president who has encountered so many personal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that in a country of 250 million, somebody would
say that,'' Smith said. ``The situation exists as it exists. There
are upsides and downsides. But the president's job approval rating
is at 72 percent, so there is a strong feeling that the upsides
outweigh any downsides, if there are any.''
