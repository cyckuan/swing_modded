<HEADLINE> Gore Appoints New Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, who continues to  
reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna 
Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile replaces Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President  
Clinton who did not want to move to Tennessee with the campaign. 
Smith will head Gore's transition to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile's appointment was to be announced by Gore today at a  
ribbon-cutting ceremony at his new Nashville, Tenn., headquarters, 
said two campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is one of the Democratic Party's most experienced  
grass-roots organizers. The appointment of Brazile, who is black, 
helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for 
being top heavy with white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile, who is in her early 40s, is former chief of staff and  
political adviser to Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.'s 
delegate to the House. She is an adjunct political science 
professor at the University of Maryland, a member of Democratic 
National Committee and longtime associate of the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile designed voter-campaign assessment program for the  
Democratic House campaign committee, which helped increase minority 
voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Orleans native, she holds an undergraduate degree from  
Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile resigned as deputy national field director for Michael  
Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign after making comments 
about the personal life of his Republican opponent, then-Vice 
President George Bush. Bush is the father of George W. Bush, the 
GOP front-runner in the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, and media adviser, Carter  
Eskew, retained their jobs in the transition to Tennessee. Gore 
ordered the move to shake up his campaign after rival Bill Bradley 
of New Jersey caught him in polls and money-raising. He replaced 
his pollster, Mark Penn, and plans to thin out his campaign staff.
