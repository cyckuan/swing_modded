 &HT;    GORE, ENDORSED BY LATINOS, WARNS GOP WOULD WIPE OUT HISPANIC
GAINS

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from
hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that
Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census
sampling and Texas Gov. George Bush's education proposals could
wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched
``Ganamos con Gore'' (''We win with Gore''), a nationwide effort to
build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic
elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice
president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said federal tax credit payments to the poor have been the
``single most beneficial economic change'' for Hispanics and other
working poor families over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that House Republicans are considering plans to
delay billions of dollars in those tax credit payments in order to
pay for other federal spending and to help finance a tax cut that
Gore described as ``risky'' to the current economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said GOP-sponsored tax cuts could lead
to reductions in federal aid to education. And while he did not
mention Bush by name, he noted that ``some Republican candidates
stand and pretend to support public education while at the same
time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public
education in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the kind of education policy recently
outlined by Bush, in which federal dollars would be diverted from
failing public schools to private schools that are not required to
admit all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the strangest education I've ever seen because they are
claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also questioned how any GOP presidential candidate could
stand by the efforts of House Republicans to stop the Census Bureau
from using statistical sampling in order to avoid the kind of
undercounting of minorities that has occurred in the last two
census counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone look at the extra problems and challenges
facing the Latino community and come to the conclusion that ...
they cannot support a fair and accurate census,'' Gore said. ``I
don't think anyone can claim to be a friend of the Latino community
while simultaneously supporting an approach to the census which is
designed to intentionally undercount Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic community, which is expected to become the largest
ethnic minority in the country by 2005, is keenly interested in the
2000 census. The population count is used in the funding formulas
of nearly every federal program.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic endorsements of Gore may have taken some of the
sting out of the decision by Friends of the Earth, an influential
environmental group, to back former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Gore's sole competitor for the 2000 Democratic presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a senior member of the Democratic
leadership in Congress, called Bradley, his fellow New Jerseyite, a
``great guy'' as he introduced Gore to the Hispanic leaders who
crowded into a Capitol Hill hotel room for the ``Ganamos con Gore''
event.
</P>
<P>
   But in reminding the crowd that Gore has stood against
Republican initiatives that were widely viewed as anti-immigrant in
the Hispanic community since the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994,
Menendez asked, ``Where were those who want our votes now who
should have been at our side defending us then?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, briefly mulled an
independent run for president, then spent time lecturing at
Stanford University in California before deciding to challenge Gore
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez also lashed out at Bush, the overwhelming favorite to
win the 2000 GOP presidential nomination, suggesting that the
Texan's campaign signature of ``compassionate conservatism''
insults Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community doesn't need compassion _ even talking to us in
that way treats us as a stepchild,'' he said. ``We don't need
compassion, we need educational opportunity ... health care
security (and) access to capital.''
</P>
<P>
   California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a longtime Gore booster,
used Bush to whip up the enthusiasm of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it. What's all this talk about George Bush and the
Latino community? They talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin
or something. Anybody who thinks that George W. Bush is good for
Latinos _ they are living la vie da loca.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think he's just a little bit more sizzle than he
is steak.''
