<HEADLINE> Daley to Take Over Gore Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Delay will resign from the present office on July 15 to replace
Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who was hired by
Gore a year ago to lead the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Daley, 51, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and
brother of the city's current mayor, has extraordinary connections
in the Democratic Party, and is considered a political insider
with ties to both President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who chaired the 1996 Democratic convention in his native
city of Chicago, helped Clinton win the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He recently led a successful campaign for the White House to
win passage of a legislation granting permanent normal trade
relations status to China by the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
A senior Gore official said Tony Coelho was leaving for health
reasons and on doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
After suffering stomach pains for three weeks, Coelho checked
into hospital in Washington Monday night. He called Gore Wednesday
night with his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general
chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first
major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
