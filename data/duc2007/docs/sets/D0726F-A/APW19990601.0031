<HEADLINE> Gore Rallies Women for His Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore received the  
endorsement of his boss' wife Tuesday as he sought to rally women 
behind his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has been out in front for women, for families, for  
children, throughout his life,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told 
several hundred women at a downtown hotel. ``Now is the time for 
all of us to be out in front for him. He is my choice and I hope 
your choice for the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will officially announce his candidacy for the nation's top  
job on June 16 in Carthage, Tenn., according to spokesman Roger 
Salazar. That is the site of the Gore family farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are expected to play a pivotal role in the 2000 elections  
and Gore is seeking to inherit the support that President Clinton 
had enjoyed among them. His focus on family issues helped him win 
the women's vote 55 percent to 37 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a head-to-head matchup with Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
the Republican leader in early presidential polls, Gore trails 
among women by 10 points -- 52 percent to 42 percent, according to a 
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were about equally split in that poll on whether Gore has  
the vision to solve the nation's problems. By a 50 percent to 32 
percent margin, they said they were less likely to vote for Gore if 
Clinton actively supports and campaigns for him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally, Gore talked about his pride in cosponsoring, as a  
senator, the bill that was the first signed into law under the 
Clinton-Gore administration -- the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
which gives workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of 
a new children, a seriously ill family member or personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised additional family-friendly policies as president.  
``I have listened to working families and I know our work is not 
done,'' Gore said as the mostly female crowd waved ``Gore 2000'' 
placards or mini-American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to extend the family leave law ``so parents  
can meet with their children's teacher without fearing the loss of 
their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also talked about making preschool available to every child,  
reducing class sizes, allowing parents to pay for college tuition 
``tax-free and inflation-free'' and using new technologies to 
tailor learning to individual children. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore noted the importance of women to her husband's  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we know from past elections, when women vote Democrats  
win,'' she said. ``We need your help to share with the country his 
vision and we need your help to get the word out about his 
commitment ... on the issues that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list of female supporters distributed by the Gore 2000  
campaign names members of Congress, former governors, other state 
officials and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on stage with Gore were Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of  
D-Texas; Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C; Maryland Lt. Gov. 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Carol Browner, administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
