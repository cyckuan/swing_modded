	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore appealed to black  
members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn 
out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and 
return control of the House to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that a turnover of the House from Republican to  
Democratic control in the 2000 election would put blacks in key 
committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
	The country needs ``more political maturity,'' not attempts to  
eliminate affirmative action programs, Gore told about 500 people 
at a dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need more division in America,'' Gore said, adding  
that that his vision of the nation in the new millennium is that of 
a place ``committed to justice as well as prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore already has formed committees for seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination next year and named several key campaign 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the start of President Clinton's administration more  
blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal 
judges than ever before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the achievements, too many are still without adequate  
health care or are forced to learn in crumbling, overcrowded 
schools buildings, he said. Blacks also remain twice as likely to 
die at birth or from HIV/AIDS, or to be unemployed, he said.
