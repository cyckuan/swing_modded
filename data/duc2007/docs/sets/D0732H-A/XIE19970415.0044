NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
provide family life education to children and youth so as to make
them ready for responsible parenthood, according to No. 1
Sessional Paper of 1997.

<P>
The government will strengthen existing child-youth programs
and formulate new plans to deal with reproductive health,
adolescent fertility, education and employment, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to help Kenyans under age 24 to solve problems
facing them, which are identified as sexually transmitted
diseases including HIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancies, abortion and
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
As many as 55 percent of Kenyans are under 18 years old and
the Kenyan youth, defined between age 15 and 24, accounts for
one-fifth of the total population.

<P>
According to the paper, Kenya would make the population
problem central to all national development agenda because its
population is the greatest asset in the development of natural
capital.
