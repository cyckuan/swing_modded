<HEADLINE> Primary Education Project Launched in Kenya </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
launched the phase two of the Strengthening Primary Education
(SPRED) project in a bid to increase enrollment rate in primary
schools.
</P>
<P>
The Project was jointly developed by the Kenyan and British
governments, and the Overseas Development Authority (ODA) of
Britain is scheduled to provide about 30 million U.S. Dollars to
support the project.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony held on Friday, Kenyan Education
Minister Joseph Kamotho said that the enrollment rate in primary
schools standing at 95 percent in 1989 declined to about 87
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the decline to ineffective teaching
methods, wide-spread poverty and poor management of schools.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, British Minister for Overseas
Development Lynda Chalker noted that the situation in Kenya's
education sector is so critical that only 35 percent of the
current seven million school-age children can expect to complete
primary education.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that "this is a tragic waste of the tremendous
potential which every girl and boy has within them."
</P>
<P>
The project is one of the largest projects ever undertaken by
the ODA in the primary education sub-sector throughout the world,
the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
During the phase one already completed, the ODA provided more
than seven million Dollars to buy textbooks and science equipment
for primary schools in arid and semi-arid areas.
</P>
<P>
The phase two is aimed at improving the quality of primary
education including the training of primary school head teachers
throughout the east African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Kamotho, the training program has already begun
and about 800 head masters are undergoing management training
courses in various teacher-training colleges.
