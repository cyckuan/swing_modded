<HEADLINE> Uganda Launches Strategy for Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has launched on Thursday a
national strategy for girls' education, calling upon the
government to scrutinize and harmonize its roles and activities in
educating girl children.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony at the International
Conference Center in Kampala, Vice-President Specioza Wandira
Kazibwe said that one of the obstacles to girls' education is lack
of physical facilities like laboratories especially in girls
schools.
</P>
<P>
This has hindered girl students from excelling in science
subjects, she added.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe said the strategy of action for girls' education
compels the government to establish a girls school that is well
facilitated with a laboratory and a computer center in every
district in the east African country so as to provide life skills
to the girl child.

Of the 146 developing countries rated on the Gender Human
Development Index, Uganda is relegated to 132nd place compared to
Kenya's 112th and Tanzania's 123rd position. At the primary level,
it put girls' enrolment at 47 percent compared to 53 percent for
boys, and it widens to 32 percent for females and 68 percent for
males at the secondary level.
