NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is ranked the 136th in the
174 countries according to the human development index contained
in a report released by the U.N. Development Program Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ranking is arranged according to how people live, factoring
in health care, life expectancy, education and income, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Canada, for the sixth consecutive
year, ranks the first among best places to live, while Norway,
ranking the second, treats women better than any other country.
</P>
<P>
In the overall index, the United States is in the third place,
followed by Japan, Belgium, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands,
Iceland, Britain, France and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the list, the 10 least developed countries
in human development terms are, from the bottom up, Sierra Leone,
Niger, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau,
Eritrea, Mali and the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Kenya lies at number 136, with Libya leading the African pack
at number 65, South Africa 101, Tunisia 102 and Algeria 109.
</P>
<P>
The 260-page report, stuffed with tables and statistics, shows
that stark and ever widening gap between rich and poor with 80
countries having less revenue than they did a decade ago.
