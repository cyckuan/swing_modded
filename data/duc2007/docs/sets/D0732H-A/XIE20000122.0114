NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Top Kenyan education official
has requested the international community to assist it in raising
11 million shillings (about 160,000 U.S.dollars) to implement the
HIV/AIDS awareness courses in schools in the east African
country.

<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted the Education
Minister Stephen Musyoka as saying that the money would be used to
facilitate the effective implementation of the syllabus and the
printing of the pamphlets and posters.

<P>
In early December 1999, Kenya launched a national anti-AIDS
strategy which included compulsory education of AIDS risks in all
Kenyan schools starting from the year 2000.

Musyoka said that the syllabus about AIDS courses has been sent
to all primary schools, secondary schools and colleges.

Around 20 percent of Kenyan youngsters aged between 14 to 17
are HIV- positive, according to a recent report by the ministry.
