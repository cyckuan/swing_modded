DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to
establish a regional apex body for a women's organization in East
Africa, according to a news dispatch from Arusha, northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Magaga Alot, a senior member of the East
African Commission at a gender workshop in Arusha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper "Role of Women in the East African
Cooperation (EAC)", Alot said when full fledged, the evisaged
women's regional organization will among others, serve as a
center for articulation, harmonization, and promoting of women's
rights and roles within the framework of the EAC and regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
Alot said that the apex body will also address issues such as
women's participation in decision-making at all levels and access
to social resources, including education, employment, health and
population services.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Women account for roughly 50 percent of the
combined population of the three (EAC) member states of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania" and the EAC cannot ignore the plight or
contribution of half of its human resource while pursuing
regional integration and development.
</P>
<P>
Alot noted that what women need and deserve is nothing more
and nothing less than the affirmation of their equal rights and
opportunities under the law and in the society at large.
