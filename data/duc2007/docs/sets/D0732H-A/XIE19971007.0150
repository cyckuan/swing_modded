<HEADLINE> Teachers' Strike Talks Deadlock in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The talks on teachers' pay
dispute between the Kenyan government and the Kenya National
Union of Teachers (KNUT) has reached a deadlock, the Daily Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the teachers' union vowed to continue with
the four-day-long strike until the Kenyan government meets its
demands.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a statement last night, advising all
teachers who started a nationwide strike on October 1 to report
to their duty stations by 8 a.m. tomorrow or face unspecified
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph
Kamotho was issued when the talks aimed at ending the strike was
going on under the chairmanship of Labour Minister Philip
Masinde.
</P>
<P>
After learning this development, John Katumanga, Chairman of
the Teachers Service Commission said that "it is unfair, immoral
and against all known labour laws to make prejudicial statements
when the talks were going on."
</P>
<P>
The striking teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging
between 150 and 200 percent, but the government has agreed to
give a 10 to 28 percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
The KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo noted that "we went
to the talks with an open mind" and prepared a proposal of
spreading the salary increase over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, the Kenyan government has not offered
anything new to the teachers at the talks and kept on saying
there is no money.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the talks had to be adjourned to
facilitate "further consultations at the political level" and to
"give the parties time to see whether all grounds were acceptable
to them."
