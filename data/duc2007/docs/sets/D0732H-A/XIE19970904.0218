<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers to Go on Strike over Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- About 240,000 teachers around
Kenya will go on strike on October 1 if the government fails to
meet their salary hike demands within 28 days, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) sent the strike
threat to Minister for Labor and Manpower Development Philip
Masinde Wednesday following a crisis meeting of the KNUT national
executive council.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150
and 200 percent as recommended by the remunerations committee,
instead of 10-to-28 percent announced by Education Minister
Joseph Kamotho Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The teachers have resolved that they will not accept anything
sort of the full implementation of the recommendations" made by
the committee, said KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the recommendations, the lowly paid teacher
should get a minimum of 5,640 Shillings a month, with a top bar
of 7,079 Shillings. The highest paid teacher (chief principal) is
to get a minimum of 42,240 Shillings, with a top bar of 52,246
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Currently around 62 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The remunerations committee also recommended automatic house
allowance for all cadre of teachers, with the lowest being 4,700
Shillings a month up from 640 Shillings. A chief principal is to
get 35,200 Shillings a month, up from 8,700 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Others are motor vehicle, transfer, hardship, commuter and
accommodation allowances.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, under the Kamotho's announcement, the lowest paid
teacher will start at 2,405 Shillings a month, up from 1,880
Shillings. The highest starts at 21,000 up from 19,115 Shillings,
with a ceiling 25,840 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The KNUT has described Kamotho's package as an insult to the
teachers in charge of about seven million children in the
country's primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamotho argued that the government is unable to
give the hefty pay rise and lucrative benefits the committee had
recommended because of inadequate budgetary allocations.
