	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party town councilor was
killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out
by the armed Basque separatist group ETA, national Spanish radio
reported.
	   Manuel Zamarreno of the Popular Party in this northern Basque
town died after a bomb exploded when it hit his car, the radio
said. According to the report, two other people in the car were
also injured in the attack that took place shortly after 11 a.m.
(0900GMT).
	   If the reports prove correct, Samareno will be the sixth victim
of ETA so far this year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign for an
independent Basque state in 1968.
