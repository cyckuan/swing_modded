<HEADLINE> Basque Group Starts Week-Long Cease-Fire in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madrid, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
said that the week-long unilateral cease-fire started today by the
militant Basque separatist group Eta is a propaganda stunt.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire, said the prime minister, was designed to
disrupt a upcoming meeting of Basque parties opposed to Eta, which
over the past 27 years has killed more than 750 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Javier Mayor Oreja called on the
Eta, which has fought for a separate Basque state made up of four
northern Spanish provinces and three southwestern French
departments, to release prison officer Jose Ortega Lara it has
held for five months.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties attending the Tuesday meeting to
concentrate on uniting against the Eta and not squabble over the
response to the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Iturgay, the Popular Party spokesman in the Basque
country, said talks with the Eta should not be considered.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Spanish Socialist Workers Party said the
week-long cease-fire was insufficient and that the Eta would have
to offer more before negotiations could be considered.
</P>
<P>
The Basque regional government, which is led by the moderate
Basque Nationalist Party, said the cease-fire provided a reason
for hope but called on the Eta to give up its arms altogether.
</P>
<P>
The Eta has said it will hold Ortega Lara until the government
changes its policy of placing Eta prisoners in jails outside the
Basque Country. Some 30 of the 600 Eta members in Spanish prisons
are due to be moved to the Basque country in coming weeks.
