Spain rules out discussing Basque independence in peace talks
</HEADLINE>

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any
discussion of Basque independence in possible peace talks with the
armed separatist group ETA, an official said Tuesday.
	   The government will only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender
its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners, government
spokesman Josep Pique said.
	   ``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,''
Pique told reporters in Barcelona.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque
nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.
	   The group began observing an open-ended cease-fire on Sept. 18.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said last week his government is
willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA. The purpose of these
discussions would be for the group to confirm it really wants
peace, the government said.
