	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of sympathizers of the radical
Basque political coalition Herri Batasuna demonstrated Saturday
demanding a negotiated solution to the violence in the northern
Basque region, news reports said.
	   Marchers shouted slogans in favor of Basque independence and
improved conditions for prisoners from the armed separatist group
ETA, a reporter from the El Correo newspaper based in this
industrial city said.
	   Herri Batasuna, considered ETA's political wing, wins about 14
percent in elections held in the northern Basque region.
	   The demonstration came two days after Manuel Zamarreno, a
governing party councilor from the small Basque town of Renteria,
was killed by a bomb blamed on ETA.
	   After Zamarreno's funeral on Friday, thousands demonstrated in
silence in the nearby coastal city of San Sebastian to repudiate
ETA violence.
	   While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader
Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that ``the repression'' of
radical Basque nationalism by the government, ``only lengthens the
conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims,'' the
national news agency EFE reported.
	   ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
close to 800 people during its 30-year campaign for an independent
Basque state straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out negotiations with
Herri Batasuana unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA lays
down its arms.
	   The coalition was forced to elect a new leadership in February
after its entire 23-member executive board was jailed for using an
ETA video calling for peace talks during an election broadcast.
