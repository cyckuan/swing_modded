	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with
the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire
as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   ETA also said that there have been no direct contacts yet with
Aznar's government. The group apparently was responding to a
government spokesman's statement Friday that officials had made
``significant contacts'' in peace efforts with ETA.
	   The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings in its
30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in northern
Spain, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18.
	   Aznar has said the group must do more to show that it is
committed to a permanent peace before substantial negotiations can
begin.
	   In its three-page announcement Monday, written in the Basque
language, ETA said it will maintain its truce but it made no
mention of making its cease-fire permanent or of laying down its
arms.
	   The government, in a goodwill gesture, announced Friday that 21
ETA inmates from far-flung prisons will be moved to jails closer to
their homes.
	   Those transfers will take place Tuesday.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym which stands for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners
held in Spanish jails be transferred closer to home.
	   The government keeps them scattered around Spain to prevent them
from plotting while behind bars.
