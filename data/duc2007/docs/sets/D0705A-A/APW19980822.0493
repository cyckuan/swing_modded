	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ A gang of hooded youths who support Basque
separatism pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other
projectiles at a street fair in Bilbao, leaving 17 people injured,
authorities said Saturday.
	   Two of the injured were in serious condition.
	   The 30-minute melee occurred outside the town hall as an
estimated 100 youths set upon members of the Basque regional
government's police force.
	   Police reported two arrests _ a 19-year-old boy and a
16-year-old girl. The latter was one of the two people seriously
injured, suffering burns when an incendiary device went off in her
hands. The girl was placed under arrest after she was hospitalized.
	   The other serious injury was a middle-aged man who was attacked
for yelling at the youths who assaulted police.
	   Overall, 17 people were injured, including five policemen,
Europa Press reported.
	   Similar violence rocked another Basque town, Getxo, last
Saturday as youths with Molotov cocktails burned down a three-story
apartment building. Its residents were evacuated in time and no
injuries were reported.
	   After that incident, Herri Batasuna, the political party linked
to the armed separatist group ETA, said for the first time that the
party opposed street violence as a way to further the Basque
separatist cause.
