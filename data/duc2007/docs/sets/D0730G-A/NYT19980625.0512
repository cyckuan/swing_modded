HIGH COURT'S LINE-ITEM RULING PRAISED IN NEW YORK

   WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state
praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's
line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set
of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding
disagreement between the state and federal government over the
legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for
health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost
the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state,
city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with
potentially devastating consequences for patient care and
government budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very gratified we won this because I realized the impact
this would have had, not only on the city, but in particular on the
ability of hospitals to care for those people who are the weakest
and in the most vulnerable positions, people without medical
insurance,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The city, where most of the state's Medicaid recipients live,
was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto, along with hospital groups
and unions for health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were taxes New York state has levied on hospitals for
many years to finance health care programs for the poor, including
health insurance for children in low-income families, AIDS services
and poison control centers. Under Medicaid, the federal health care
program for the poor, Washington matched much of the revenue raised
by those taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the Clinton administration raised concerns about
whether some of the taxes were legal under a 1991 federal law
intended to prevent Medicaid abuses by states. New York requested a
waiver from the 1991 law, but after much haggling, the
administration declined to grant one.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the stalemate and concerned that the
administration would eventually demand repayment of some of the
federal matching funds, New York state officials and city hospital
officials asked New York's senators, Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican,
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to insert language in a
1997 budget bill declaring the taxes legal and absolving the state
of responsibility for repaying any of the Medicaid matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   The senators complied and the measure was approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, White House officials were searching for
budget provisions that would be appropriate for Clinton's inaugural
use of the line-item veto. Last August, the president selected
three, one of which was the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment, contending
that the measure would set a damaging precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The veto almost immediately became a political headache for the
administration, as New York Democrats joined labor unions, hospital
officials, advocates for the poor and Republicans in assailing the
president for jeopardizing programs for the indigent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was never really clear that the administration was on the
verge of declaring the state's hospital taxes illegal. And even had
it done that, many federal officials said, it would have been
unlikely for the administration to demand that the state, with its
large pool of Democratic voters, or its hospitals reimburse any of
the Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hospital officials declared Thursday that the Supreme
Court had rescued New York's hospital system from a potential
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to pay this money back, it would have come at
inducing a crisis in the health care system,'' said Kenneth Raske,
president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a hospital
trade group.
