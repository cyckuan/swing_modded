<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court to Rule on Line-Item Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court agreed on
Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the
president line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a federal judge struck down the line-item
veto law as unconstitutional, but the administration has appealed
that ruling directly to the Supreme Court, as mandated by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The highest court's review will yield by late June what could
be a momentous balance-of-powers ruling. The case is scheduled to
be argued before the justices on April 27.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Republican-led Congress voted to provide the
president with the unprecedented power of canceling specific items
in spending and tax legislation, considered a key to fighting
wasteful "pork-barrel" projects.
</P>
<P>
The law took effect in January 1997, and Clinton used the
line-item veto 82 times last year, but Congress is expected to
restore 38 of those items with two-thirds majority votes in both
the House of Representatives and Senate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan said the 1996 law wrongly
"crosses the line between acceptable delegations of rule-making
authority and unauthorized surrender to the president of an
inherently legislative function; namely, the authority to
permanently shape laws and package legislation."
</P>
<P>
In the appeal acted on Friday, Justice Department lawyers
argued that Congress did not let the president unlawfully usurp
its power.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto was challenged last year by a group of
mostly Democratic senators, but the challenge was dismissed by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
This term's challengers are led by New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Idaho farmers.
</P>
<P>
Giuliani is seeking to restore a provision of last summer's
budget-balancing bill that would have let the city and New York
state raise taxes on hospitals and use the money to attract
federal Medicaid payments.

The Snake River Potato Growers sued over a Clinton veto of farm
cooperative subsidies.
