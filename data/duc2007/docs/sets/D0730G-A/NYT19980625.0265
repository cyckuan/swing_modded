   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the
power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law
that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items
from massive budget legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act
violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress,
which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it
into law or vetoes it.
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, has no authority to erase individual
provisions in legislation, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the president
to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent on
the subject of unilateral presidential action that either repeals
or amends parts of duly enacted statutes,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the majority. ``There are powerful reasons for
construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important
issue as equivalent to an express prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement saying he was ``deeply
disappointed'' by the Supreme Court's ruling, which he called ``a
defeat for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating
waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate
over how to make the best use of public funds,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who joined House and Senate
colleagues in waging an unsuccessful challenge to the law last
year, said he feels vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness the Supreme Court has saved Congress from
itself,'' Skaggs said. ``The court has restored an absolutely
central provision to our constitutional balance: that Congress
writes the laws and can't give that power and responsibility
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the controversial statute, a president could _ after
signing a budget bill into law _ unilaterally strike individual
funding sections of the measure. Congress could create a separate
bill to restore the deleted provisions with a majority vote of both
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, the high court said the law violates the Constitution's
``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure''
for the enactment of laws. That process requires the president to
approve or reject legislation in full, whereas the Line Item Veto
Act impermissibly allowed him to strike legislation piecemeal, the
justices added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the
president to create a different law _ one whose text was not voted
on by either house of Congress or presented to the president for
signature,'' Stevens wrote. ``If there is to be a new procedure in
which the president will play a different role in determining the
final text of what may become a law, such a change must come not by
legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in ...
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas
joined Stevens' opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, took a swipe at Congress for
what he characterized as its cowardly attempt to surrender to the
president by statute its primary authority to raise and spend
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' Kennedy wrote. ``Abdication of responsibility is not
part of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia, taking the unusual and
intense step of reading part of his dissent from the bench,
defended the law as a legitimate exercise of Congress'
constitutional prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act ``succeeded
in faking out the Supreme Court'' because the statute does not give
the president new veto authority, Scalia said. Instead, the law
merely allows presidents to continue what they have always done by
exercising executive discretion to spend or not spend money
Congress has appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer joined
Scalia's dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City,
marked the second time the justices considered the
constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect
in January 1997. Last year, the court rejected a challenge from
senators and representatives who said the statute violated the
authority of Congress to write laws.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said the lawmakers lacked standing to bring the
challenge because they suffered no injury as a result of the law's
enactment. In this year's case, the court _ over an objection from
Scalia _ said New York City and Idaho potato farmers could
challenge the law's constitutionality after Clinton eliminated
sections of funding legislation that would have benefited the city
and farmers.

<P>
   In New York's case, Clinton struck a section of the 1997
Balanced Budget Act that would have relieved the city's Health and
Hospitals Corp. of having to pay millions of dollars in retroactive
tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the Idaho group, the president eliminated a
provision of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act that would have given
potato farmers a capital gains tax break in purchasing a processing
facility.
