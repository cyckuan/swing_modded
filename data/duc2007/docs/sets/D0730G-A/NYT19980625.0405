   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court decision striking down the presidential line-item veto. The
opinion in the case, Clinton vs. City of New York, was written by
Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices William H.
Rehnquist, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dissenting opinions, which are also excerpted
below, were filed by Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor joined, and by Justice Stephen G. Breyer.

   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Stevens  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act . . . was enacted in April 1996 and
became effective on January 1, 1997. The following day, six members
of Congress who had voted against the act brought suit in the
District Court for the District of Columbia challenging its
constitutionality. On April 10, 1997, the District Court entered an
order holding that the Act is unconstitutional. Byrd vs. Raines. In
obedience to the statutory direction to allow a direct, expedited
appeal to this Court . . . we promptly noted probable jurisdiction
and expedited review. . . . We determined, however, that the
members of Congress did not have standing to sue because they had
not ``alleged a sufficiently concrete injury to have established
Article III standing . . . thus, ``in light of (the) overriding and
time-honored concern about keeping the judiciary's power within its
proper constitutional sphere,'' . . . we remanded the case to the
District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack
of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after our decision in that case, the
President exercised his authority to cancel one provision in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . . . and two provisions in the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 . . . Appellees, claiming that they had
been injured by two of those cancellations, filed these cases in
the District Court. That Court again held the statute invalid, . .
. and we again expedited our review . . . We now hold that these
appellees have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the
act and, reaching the merits, we agree that the cancellation
procedures set forth in the Act violate the Presentment Clause,
Art. I, 7, cl. 2, of the Constitution. .
</P>
<P>
   In both legal and practical effect, the President has amended
two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each. ``(R)epeal of
statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art. I.'' There
is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President
to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes. Both Article I and
Article II assign responsibilities to the President that directly
relate to the lawmaking process, but neither addresses the issue
presented by these cases. The President ``shall from time to time
give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union, and
recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge
necessary and expedient.'' Art. II, 3. Thus, he may initiate and
influence legislative proposals. (footnote 27) Moreover, after a
bill has passed both houses of Congress, but ``before it become(s)
a law,'' it must be presented to the President. If he approves it,
``he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his
objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed
to reconsider it.'' Art. I, 7, cl. 2. (footnote 28) His ``return''
of a bill, which is usually described as a ``veto,'' (footnote 29)
is subject to being overridden by a two-thirds vote in each House.
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences between the President's
``return'' of a bill pursuant to Article I, 7 and the exercise of
the President's cancellation authority pursuant to the Line Item
Veto Act. The constitutional return takes place BEFORE the bill
becomes law; the statutory cancellation occurs AFTER the bill
becomes law. The constitutional return is of the entire bill; the
statutory cancellation is of only a part. Although the Constitution
expressly authorizes the President to play a role in the process of
enacting statutes, it is silent on the subject of unilateral
Presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly
enacted statutes.
</P>
<P>
   There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional silence
on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to an express
prohibition. The procedures governing the enactment of statutes set
forth in the text of Article I were the product of the great
debates and compromises that produced the Constitution itself.
Familiar historical materials provide abundant support for the
conclusion that the power to enact statutes may only ``be exercised
in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively
considered, procedure.'' Our first President understood the text of
the Presentment Clause as requiring that he either ``approve all
the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto.'' (footnote 30) What has
emerged in these cases from the President's exercise of his
statutory cancellation powers, however, are truncated versions of
two bills that passed both Houses of Congress. They are not the
product of the ``finely wrought'' procedure that the Framers
designed. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I, 7. The fact that
Congress intended such a result is of no moment. Although Congress
presumably anticipated that the President might cancel some of the
items in the Balanced Budget Act and in the Taxpayer Relief Act,
Congress cannot alter the procedures set out in Article I, 7,
without amending the Constitution. (footnote 40) . . .
</P>
<P>
   If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the
President to create a different law, one whose text was not voted
on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for
signature. Something that might be known as ``Public Law 105-33 as
modified by the President'' may or may not be desirable, but it is
surely not a document that may ``become a law'' pursuant to the
procedures designed by the Framers of Article I, 7, of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will
play a different role in determining the final text of what may
``become a law,'' such change must come not by legislation but
through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the
Constitution. . . .

   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Scalia
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power
conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's
worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to
CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent
on a particular item at the President's discretion. And the latter
has been done since the founding of the nation. From 1789-1791, the
First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire
government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad
purposes. From a very early date Congress also made permissive
individual appropriations, leaving the decision whether to spend
the money to the President's unfettered discretion. . . . Examples
of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President
abound in our history. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline
to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization
would have been constitutional. What the Line Item Veto Act does
instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending
is technically different. But the technical difference does NOT
relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have
been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional
delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine
of technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed
to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply
with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out
the Supreme Court. The President's action it authorizes in fact is
not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art. I, 7; and
insofar as the substance of that action is concerned, it is no
different from what Congress has permitted the President to do
since the formation of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Breyer
</P>
<P>
   In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel. In a sense,
it skirts a constitutional edge. But that edge has to do with
means, not ends. The means chosen do not amount literally to the
enactment, repeal or amendment of a law. Nor, for that matter, do
they amount literally to the ``line item veto'' that the act's
title announces. Those means do not violate any basic separation of
powers principle. They do not improperly shift the constitutionally
foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President. Nor,
since they comply with Separation of Powers principles, do they
threaten the liberties of individual citizens. They represent an
experiment that may, or may not, help representative government
work better. The Constitution, in my view, authorizes Congress and
the President to try novel methods in this way. Consequently, with
respect, I dissent.
