COURT STRIKES DOWN PRESIDENT'S LINE-ITEM VETO POWER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting
the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American
political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the
president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the
``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the
legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's
political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that
President Clinton used 82 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of
powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step
of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the
issue was of ``profound importance.'' The court, Stevens wrote,
``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is
``not authorized by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president
by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual
provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's
governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S. Grant and
desired by every modern president since Harry Truman. In a
statement released by the White House, President Clinton said he
was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, which he characterized
as ``a defeat for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional
traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard
congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto
represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a
president to pick and choose among congressional spending
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day, a great day for the United States of
America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,''
said Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who has
opposed the line-item veto for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Many Supreme Court decisions set off ripples that disturb the
pond of politics, but this ruling will shape the political
environment in Washington intimately for years to come. Thursday's
ruling, coming on the next-to-last day of the high court's term,
will affect not only legislative strategy but also legislative
content, making it even more tempting for lawmakers to add special
or local-interest provisions into spending bills. Its influence
will be felt immediately this summer, as the 13 appropriations
bills make their slow passage from subcommittee all the way to the
president's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, moreover, provides a window into the high court's
view of the relationship between the other two branches of
government. It affirms the very first word of the first sentence of
the first section of the first article of the Constitution, where
the framers wrote: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down the measure by citing a clause deeper in
the Constitution, where the framers stipulated that ``every bill''
that passed the House and Senate shall ``be presented'' to the
president, who can sign it into law or return it to Congress if he
objects. The court found that the line-item veto violated this
``Presentment Clause,'' and the historical record provides
``abundant support'' for the notion that there should be no
deviation from the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will
play a different role in determining the text of what may `become a
law,' such change must come not by legislation but through the
amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,''
Stevens wrote. He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dissenting were Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, writing for the dissenters, argued that the true intent
of the line-item veto law was misread by the court majority. ``The
title...designed to simplify... or perhaps merely comply with the
terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme
Court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The line-item veto struck down Thursday allowed a president to
sign a statute into law, but then, within five days, cancel certain
items in the legislation. Congress could in turn reinstate the item
by passing a separate bill, which it did in 38 of the instances in
which Clinton exercised the power.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, found that the ``Presentment Clause'' was
crafted in a deliberate fashion. Constitutional scholars believe
the framers intended both houses of Congress and the president to
approve any law, a slow process that nonetheless frustrates
factional interests.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling in effect establishes, or restores, a
firewall between the law-making function of Congress and the final
approval function of the president. ``This legislative process was
deemed so fundamental to our freedoms that the court didn't want to
allow an exception, even for what might be deemed a lovable purpose
like cutting federal spending,'' said David Schoenbrod, a law
professor at the New York Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in adopting the legislation, tried to get around the
``Presentment Clause'' by saying the president actually signed
bills into law and, then, separately, went back and canceled
specific budget and tax items.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a highly formalistic approach, and the court saw
through it,'' said Kate Stith-Cabranes, a Yale Law School expert on
legislation. ``This really is a line-item veto, and it was not
contemplated by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the line-item veto announced they would
immediately offer legislation to circumvent the justices' decision
by requiring each spending item approved by Congress to be listed
as a separate bill for the president's signature or veto.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen years ago, the justices prohibited a similar
aggrandizement of power beyond those expressly mentioned in the
Constitution, though that time, Congress benefitted instead of the
president. That ruling, made in 1983, struck down a law permitting
either House of Congress to veto some executive branch decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The line-item veto was apppealed to the Supreme Court shortly
after it was approved by Congress, but the justices threw out the
case, saying that the plaintiffs _ Byrd and Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat, and then-Senator Mark O. Hatfield,
the Oregon Republican _ didn't have standing for their complaint.
At the time, the justices said the senators' suit was largely a
theoretical exercise since they were not harmed. The justices
ruling Thursday grew out of challenges to the law filed by parties
in Idaho and New York directly harmed by specific line-item vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, &UR;  &LR; however, it is clear that the line-item veto has resulted
in a significant shift in the balance of power to the president,
changing the way lawmakers sought funding for favored spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus to create a line-item veto came less from politics
than from economics, and the momentum gathered force as the federal
budget deficit grew in the 1980s and the early 1990s. In the past
as in modern times, its earliest adherants viewed it as a tool of
thrift. In his landmark commentary on American government written
110 years ago, Lord Bryce said the line-item veto was ``desired by
enlightened men'' and would ``save the nation millions of dollars a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who criticized Thursday's ruling, including Clinton,
emphasized the line-item veto's role in keeping government
efficient and inexpensive. ``The line-item veto act was a vital
force in restoring the appropriate balance of power, and
eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel spending,'' said
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ``Unfortunately,
pork-barrel spending is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Clinton v. City of New York, 97-1374.
