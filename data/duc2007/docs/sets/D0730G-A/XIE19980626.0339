<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rules Line-Item Veto Law Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday
struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets
the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending
measures.
</P>
<P>
The high court's 6-3 decision said the law violates that part
of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the
president for his approval or veto.
</P>
<P>
The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized
only through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an
Idaho potato growers' group after provisions they sought were
vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto,
the authority sought by nearly every president this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority,
and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional in
February, saying Congress could not delegate such authority to the
president.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law let the president sign a bill and within
five days go back to reject specific spending items or tax breaks
in it. Congress then could reinstate the item by passing a
separate bill.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the line-item veto argued that once a law is
signed by the president, it can be changed only in the way
prescribed by the Constitution for enacting a law -- a
congressional vote followed by the president's signature. Once the
president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not
be the same as the measure approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration contended a line-item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law, but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said the administration and the veto law's
backers in Congress were wrong.
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that
"the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not
authorized by the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
In ruling the line-item veto law unconstitutional last February,
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said it amounted to a surrender
by Congress of an "inherently legislative function" to the
president. Once a bill becomes law, the president's sole duty is to
carry it out, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld that ruling.
