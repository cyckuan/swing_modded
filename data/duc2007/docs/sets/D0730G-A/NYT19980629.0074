   President Clinton lost one and won one at the U.S. Supreme Court
on Thursday. The Line Item Veto Act was struck down. And the court
upheld the principle that death does not unravel the
confidentiality of communication between attorney and client. The
American people won in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court
divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case (Clinton vs. City of New
York). Stevens focuses solely on the Presentment Clause _ Article
I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution: ``Every bill which shall
have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall,
before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the
United States; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall
return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have
originated ....'' Returning a bill is a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can only override a presidential veto by a two-thirds
majority vote in each house.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend
laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws. He
writes: ``There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes
the president to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is deferential to Congress and the president in the
opinion: ``... we express no opinion about the wisdom of the
procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The text of the act was itself the product of much debate and
deliberation in both Houses of Congress and that precise text was
signed into law by the President. We do not lightly conclude that
their action was unauthorized by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue
raised by the lower federal court when it found the act
unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of
powers between the legislative and executive branch. Stevens
writes: ``... our decision rests on the narrow ground that the
procedure authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are not authorized
by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent in which he was
joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and in part by Justice
Stephen Breyer. In short, Scalia doesn't think that the Line Item
Veto Act violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia is a master sophist; he plays word games. Under the act,
after both houses of Congress have passed a bill, the president can
sign it and then cancel portions. To Scalia the chronology of
events is pivotal, not the central meaning of the clause. He writes
in his dissent: ``It was only after the requirements of the
Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the president exercised
his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel the spending
item.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Scalia is in the minority on this issue. Under any
reading of the Constitution, the act is unconstitutional. A
president's authority to amend or repeal a law is neither
enumerated nor implied by the Constitution. Quite simply, such
presidential powers do not exist _ unless Congress chooses to amend
the Constitution to give presidents that power, and three-fourths
of the state legislatures agree.
</P>
<P>
   The current problem, however, is that the 82 spending items that
Clinton cancelled using the unconstitutional law are no longer
cancelled. New York City can now expect $2.5 billion in federal
funds for its Medicaid program. And what was once a balanced budget
with a surplus is no longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the attorney-client confidentiality case, Clinton won. Back
in July 1993, White House aide Vincent Foster Jr. met with his
attorney James Hamilton for two hours regarding the controversy
concerning the White House travel office and firing employees
there. Hamilton took handwritten notes during the meeting. Nine
days later Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr wanted those notes to further
his investigation into allegations that White House aides or first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had lied under oath. Starr claimed that
when Hamilton's client died, the confidentiality of the
attorney-client privilege died with it. Fortunately for everyone,
Starr lost.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the 6-to-3
majority (Swidler &AMP; Berlin and Hamilton vs. United States):
``Knowing that communication will remain confidential even after
death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with
counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent
withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if
disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal
context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had argued that the attorney-client privilege should not
prevent disclosure of confidential communications if the client has
died and the information is relevant to a criminal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to Rehnquist. Only two lower court decisions
support Starr's argument. Most assume the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice concludes, ``... the independent counsel has
simply not made a sufficient showing to overturn the common law
rule embodied in the prevailing caselaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was looking only at his target and not the implications
for society. This privilege is too significant to be eroded by the
independent counsel's suspicions of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the high court's decision gone the other way, think of the
ambitious prosecuting attorneys who might feel free to rifle
through communications between dead defendants and their attorneys
fishing for accomplices and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what the erosion of this privilege might do to the
weaker privilege of confidentiality between doctor and patient, or
to the necessary confidentiality between priest and confessional.
Then consider the likely impact on our society.
