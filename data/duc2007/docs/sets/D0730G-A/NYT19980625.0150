<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress
violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the
president the power to cut individual projects from tax and
spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act
unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after
its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house
of Congress. The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the
president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel
individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of
signing them into law. Congress, however, was allowed to try to
reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an
authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the
law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of
laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of
separation of powers among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be
desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they
had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury
because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws. One
was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the
law, claiming it was injured by the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group
also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax
measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer
capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers'
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto
unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's
separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the high court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case,
saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the
act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of
the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into
law, were unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers
said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or
for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not
passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts
a constitutional edge ... it does not violate any basic separation
of powers principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In other major decisions Thursday, the court ruled:
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote that the attorney-client privilege does not end
with the death of the client. It thus blocked Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's attempt to obtain notes taken by James Hamilton,
the lawyer for deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster Jr. nine
days before Foster committed suicide in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That the government can deny cash grants to artists because
their work is considered indecent, saying the policy does not
violate artists' free-speech rights. The 8-1 decision said the
National Endowment for the Arts can consider decency, as well as
artistic merit, in deciding who gets public money for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   That HIV-infected people are protected by a federal ban on
discrimination against the disabled even if they suffer no symptoms
of AIDS. The 5-4 ruling ordered a lower court to reconsider whether
a Maine dentist violated the Americans With Disabilities Act when
he refused to fill an HIV-infected woman's tooth in his office.
