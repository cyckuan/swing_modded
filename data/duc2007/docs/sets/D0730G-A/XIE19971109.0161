<HEADLINE> U.S. House Rejects Clinton's Line-Item Veto Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives today voted 352-64 to reject President Bill
Clinton's line-item veto of 38 military construction programs in
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also voted 69-30 last month to restore funding for 36
of the 38 projects. Both the votes were well above the two-thirds
needed to overturn a presidential veto. But it was unclear whether
the two chambers can come up with a unified bill before they recess
for the year, possibly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Clinton gained the line-item veto power to veto
individual spending items in bills while signing the bills to ensure
the administration moving in a new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the president exercised his new authority by killing
38 military construction projects in 24 states worth 287 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far the White House has vetoed 163 line-items against six
bills, mostly affecting military projects.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the president used his authority to
cancel projects that were not requested in the budget and would not
substantially improve the quality of life of military service
members.
</P>
<P>
The House today also completed work on seven other bills to
finish its work and leave for its year-end recess Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It passed by voice vote the Reading Excellence Act, which
authorizes 260 million dollars over three years to help teachers,
tutors and parents to learn how to teach children reading.
</P>
<P>
It also passed by a vote of 291-125 legislation to authorize
agricultural research and education programs through 2002.
