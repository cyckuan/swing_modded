<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Rules Line-Item Veto Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. district judge
Thursday declared the president's line-item veto authority
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law -- which gives the
president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures
without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional
balance of powers between the various branches of government
</P>
<P>
"The Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it
impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three
branches of government," said Thomas Hogan.
</P>
<P>
However, Hogan's ruling will likely not be the final word in
the case. The issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill
Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under
the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
</P>
<P>
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing
a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82
times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending
projected over five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, "It
is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled
constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject
specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire
measure.
</P>
<P>
Hogan ruled that Congress may not "delegate its inherent
lawmaking authority."
</P>
<P>
New York City maintains it was unfairly targeted by Clinton
when he canceled a section of the federal budget bill that would
have let the city and state raise taxes on hospitals and pass
those charges along to the federal government in the form of
Medicaid billings.
