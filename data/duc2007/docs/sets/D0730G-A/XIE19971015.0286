<HEADLINE> Clinton Uses Line-Item Power to Veto Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144
million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed 13 relatively obscure research and spending
programs, almost all the military spending increases approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The new vetoes came weeks after he vetoed 287 million dollars
from a separate 9.2 billion dollars military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
The cuts included 39 million dollars that would have kept the
remaining three SR-71 Blackbird spy planes flying. Pentagon said
that the SR-71 was no longer needed because of the capabilities of
spy satellites, improved U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned
robot planes.
</P>
<P>
Other cuts included 30 million dollars that would have financed
research on tracking and intercepting asteroids before they
collide with earth, 3 million dollars for microsurgery research
and 3 million dollars for an underwater noisemaking device.
</P>
<P>
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as
being affected compared to two Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers added 750 projects to the defense appropriations bill
that were not in Clinton's original defense spending plan. All but
13 of those survived the line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as
being affected compared to two Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers now threatened to consider repealing the
line-item veto law, passed only last year as a budget-balancing
measure.
