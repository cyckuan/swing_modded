<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the
Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by
vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to
strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the
Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must
``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but
cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple. ``The
President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion
of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with
Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single
finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the
budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual
items of federal spending and tax breaks. But the court said
Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' with the ruling. ``The decision is a defeat for all
Americans,'' Clinton said. ``It deprives the president of a
valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for
enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of
public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws,
eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals
and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the
Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care
workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy
chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' Kennedy declared. ``Abdication of responsibility is not
part of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans'
``Contract With America.'' Sixty-nine senators and more than 290
House members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents since Ulysses Grant have sought the line-item veto,
and Ronald Reagan popularized the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty
of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the
president. ``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the
branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and
Sandra Day O'Connor _ would have upheld the line-item veto. Scalia
said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between
allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the
line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular
item at his discretion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg
joined the majority opinion by Stevens in the case, Clinton vs.
City of New York, No. 97-1374.
</P>
<P>
   Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Daniel Coats, R-Ind., said they would keep fighting for it.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an
omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as
a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto. Under this
arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the Line Item Veto Act ``gives the president the
unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In exercising the power, Clinton has infuriated members of
Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.
Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining that
Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states. In
February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military
construction projects worth $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money saved by Clinton's line-item vetoes is
difficult to calculate, but members of Congress said it was less
than 1 percent of the total federal budget of $1.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the
line-item veto, was ecstatic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great
day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said. ``Today
we feel that the liberties of the American people have been
assured. God save this honorable court!''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Breyer said the line-item veto was an
acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of
individual citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years,
disagreed. Byrd quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century
English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the
supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the
laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body
of men. And wherever these two powers are united together, there
can be no public liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton
had used the device. In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that
there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers
had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York
hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual
injury.'' Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a
potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could
harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.

<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., rejoiced at the decision.
``In the history of Congress,'' Moynihan said, ``we have never had
an issue of such importance for the powers of the executive and
legislative branches. Liberty has prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal
money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and
Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from
Congress. Under the Line Item Veto Act, the president could cancel
tax breaks that benefited fewer than 101 people.
</P>
<P>
   People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and
insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit,
even though they did not challenge Clinton's actions in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the
Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a
tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a
lawyer who filed a brief for three House Democrats opposed to the
line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Democrats, Rep. David Skaggs of Colorado, said,
``The Supreme Court has saved Congress from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 governors have some form of line-item veto, but the
power is usually granted by state constitutions, not just by state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the
wisdom of the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act.''
But, he said, if Congress wants to establish such procedures, it
must amend the federal Constitution.
