<HEADLINE> Clinton Weighs Line-Item Veto Power Use </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual
items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his
signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to
be used "somewhat sparingly."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to sign the budget and tax-cut bills on
Tuesday. After signing them, he has five days to decide whether to
cut out individual items.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his support for the line-item veto, Clinton told
reporters during a photo session, "I think if we have it, it ought
to be used. I believe that it ought to be used somewhat sparingly."
</P>
<P>
Before the new law was passed last year, the only way
presidents could reject spending laws was to veto whole budget
bills. Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto
authority.
</P>
<P>
He said his aides were still reviewing the tax and budget bills
to determine which items were open to the line-item veto, or
whether any of them should be stricken.
</P>
<P>
Last week, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said
he doubted Clinton would veto specific items, saying that to do so
would violate the spirit of the bipartisan negotiations between
the White House and the Congress.
