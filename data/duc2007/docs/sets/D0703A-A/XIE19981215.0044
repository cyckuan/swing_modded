BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Administration Board of
Romania's central bank (BNR)has had made a number of decisions in
connection with the introduction of the single currency in the
European Union's member states beginning January 1, 1999, BNR
director Adrian Vasilescu said on Monday.

Vasilescu said the central bank had decided that the rates of
exchange posted by hard currency operators should also include the
single currency unit. The single currency will be also used in the
reports issued by the General Directorate of Monetary and Hard
Currency Policy, he added.

Vasilescu said the BNR would use the Euro money unit in printed
matters destined for the mass-media. The daily exchange rates
released by the central bank would include the single currency,
too, he said.

The new currency will affect only the Romanian businessmen in
the Euro zone and those whose trade is dominated by the single
currency unit, Vasilescu said.

According to statistics, the EU is the most important
commercial partner of Romania, with the bilateral trade making up
60 percent of Romanian total foreign trade.
