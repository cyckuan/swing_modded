<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Moves to Link its Currency with the Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has been working to
link its currency, the lev, with the proposed European single
currency, the euro, in a bid to speed up the country's financial
integration into the European economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of
the euro, which is scheduled for January 1, 1999, the Bulgarian
government adopted a system of monetary commission on July 1,
1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, one German mark is equivalent to 1,000
Bulgarian lev. The mark has also been used for the settlement of
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev has pledged that the
lev will experience its connection with the euro automatically as
the European single currency comes into use less than three months
later, and that the entire process of transition will be
accomplished by July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
With regard to easing the accounting, the Bulgarian government
plans to print next year a new national currency, with a face
value of one lev equivalent to one Mark.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the euro will be used to replace the German mark as
the accounting unit for Bulgaria's foreign exchange reserve.
