<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Using Euro in Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering using
the European single currency, the euro, in the country's foreign
reserves, the Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Ministers of Thailand has ordered the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand to study the possibility
as the single European currency is set to go into circulation on
January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
A special task force will study the impact of the euro on the
country's official reserves in a bid to help stem volatility of
the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"If the euro proves stable, Thailand will use it as part of our
international reserves," a government official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council also assigned the Commerce Ministry to
set up a group to work with state agencies, including the Foreign
Ministry, to examine the impact of the euro on Thailand's
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a study on the impact on the country's investment
will be undertaken by the Board of Investment while the National
Economic and Social Development Board will join hands with the
central bank to dig into the impact of the European single
currency on Thailand's macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
A combined European Union market is expected to be helpful for
Thai exporters to gain more excess into the market. The single
currency will also benefit Thailand's import from the EU as it
will reduce the operating costs of European traders.
</P>
<P>
However, the arrival of the euro is likely to reduce Thailand's
trading volume with other countries significantly, the official
said.
