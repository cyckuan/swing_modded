	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's new currency, the euro, will
rival the U.S. dollar as an international currency over the long
term, Der Spiegel magazine reported Sunday.
	   A number of countries are already planning to hold the euro as
part of their foreign currency reserves, the magazine quoted
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg as saying.
	   Oil imports to Europe can also be calculated in euros as well as
dollars, Duisenberg was quoted as saying.
	   ``That which the Americans see as their automatic right, namely
the financing of their enormous trade deficit by other countries in
their own currency, won't be automatically acceptable any more,''
Spiegel quoted Duisenberg as saying.
	   The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship
between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect
on Jan. 12, to be stable.
