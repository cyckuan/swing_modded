<HEADLINE> Europe Begins Designing Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite skepticism about the actual
realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January
1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already
begun.
</P>
<P>
The European Monetary Institute, responsible for the
preparations, has set up a consultative group of artists, art
historians and psychologists to come up with designs.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released
today that it has decided on two themes for the new
currency: history of European civilization and abstract or
concrete paintings.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is expected to have seven notes with face values
ranging from five to 500.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which functions as a preparatory European
Central Bank, began to invite tenders for making the new currency
in February.
</P>
<P>
The institute requires the design of the Euro to include five
languages of the European Union together with the symbol of the EU
-- 12 stars in a ring. It hasn't been decided whether the Euro
should include country emblems.
</P>
<P>
The Euro must also be counterfeit-proof and must include
special designs to accommodate blind or poor-sighted
people.
