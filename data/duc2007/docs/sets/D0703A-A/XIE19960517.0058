<HEADLINE> UK Building Societies Prepare for Euro Mortgages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest mortgage lenders
are planning to overhaul the traditional home loan ahead of a
single European currency with the launch of euro mortgages.
</P>
<P>
Lending giants in Britain have put detailed plans in place for
financial life in the country after 1999, when they believe
European currencies will join in a single currency, the euro, with
the UK forced to accompany them within several years.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said that the building societies have
produced blueprints for euro savings accounts, passbooks and
cash-dispensers despite the government's increasingly
Eurosceptical tone.

A spokesman of Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender in the UK,
said, "Our view is that a single European currency will happen and
that the UK will be brought in within two or three years. This
will mean substantial changes for our products, the housing market
and the economy as a whole. We have to look forward and be
prepared."
</P>
<P>
Bradford and Bingley's plans for a euro mortgage are already at
an advanced stage, and will be launched ahead of the UK's
participation in the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Its chief executive Geoffrey Lister said, "We believe euro
mortgages will be popular because they will offer lower interest
rates than sterling mortgages. We could even reach the stage where
Britain remains outside the currency alignment but employees ask
to be paid in euro."
