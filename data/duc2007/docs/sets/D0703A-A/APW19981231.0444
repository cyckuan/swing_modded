 &UR; Bulgaria fixes lev against euro &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The Bulgarian National Bank announced
Thursday its national currency, the lev, will be fixed at 1,955.83
to the euro.
	   Under the currency board system established in July 1997, the
domestic money supply is backed by foreign currency reserves. Since
its launch, the domestic money supply has been backed by German
marks at a rate of 1,000 to the mark.
	   With the launch of the euro on New Year's Day, the lev will
formally be backed by euros.
	   The currency board was established to help reduce inflation by
preventing the central bank from lending to the government or local
banks. Inflation is expected to fall below 9 percent in 1998, down
from 573 percent in 1997.
	   The government has said it will keep the currency board in place
until the country is in a position to adopt the euro as its own
currency. The government doesn't expect to be in a position to
begin membership negotiations with the European Union until 2001.
	   EU membership is a prerequisite for adopting the euro as a
national currency.
