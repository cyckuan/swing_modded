PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- France has already struck one
billion coins of the European single currency euro, which will be
launched by January 1999, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP) on
Thursday.

Besides France, only Finland, Belgium and Spain have begun
their production of the euros, but not as much as France, said AFP
quoting official sources.

Germany is in "an advanced stage" of experimenting striking the
euro, while other European nations which will join euro are due to
begin producing the coin next year.

A total of 70 billion coins of the single currency should be
issued to replace the national currencies by January 2002.
