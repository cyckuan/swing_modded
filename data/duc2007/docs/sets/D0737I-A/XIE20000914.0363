CHANGSHA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully
collected natural benthal electric data using an electromagnetic
survey machine at 200 meters under the sea, according to official
sources.

The machine that can work at a maximum depth of 500 meters was
developed by a research team led by He Jishan, an expert with the
Chinese Academy of Engineering. The test was taken at the electric
field under the sea of the Taiwan Straits.

Sea electromagnetic surveying is an advanced benthal
exploration measure. China has pinpointed benthal surveying
research as a key national technological project, which has been
