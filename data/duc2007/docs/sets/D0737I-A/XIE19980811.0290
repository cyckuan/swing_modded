WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest
international science ventures undertaken in New Zealand waters
will begin later this month with the arrival of an advanced French
research ship to carry out a program of deep sea drilling.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday reported that scientists
from 11 countries, including New Zealand, France, Australia and
Britain, are due to join the flagship Joides Resolution as it has
drilled seven holes along the eastern coast of New Zealand to
retrieve sediment and rock for analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted New Zealand scientist Lionel Carter, one of
the researchers who will be on board, as saying that the project
is part of a global initiative to determine how the oceans tick
and influence climate.
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member
countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more
than 1,300 sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand visit, dubbed "Leg 181" and hoping to uncover
the history of the South Pacific Ocean in the past 32 million
years, will last two months. The bill for the New Zealand leg has
been estimated at six million U.S. dollars, funded mainly by the
United States' National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water
depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in
waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or
more below the seabed.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carter said this is truly a remarkable capability
considering the ship will be bobbing in the ocean with 4 km of
rotating drill pipe snaking through current-swept waters to the
seabed and penetrating several hundred meters below to obtain the
core material.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's eastern coast has been chosen because of its
position across the great current systems of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is the visible part of a vast submarine continent,
half the size of Australia, that projects deep into the pathways
of the currents, Dr. Carter said.
