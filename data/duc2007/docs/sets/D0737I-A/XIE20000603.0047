CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pharaonic statues and sphinxes as well
as Byzantine coins have been found in the undersea remains of
ancient cities off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, a French undersea
explorer said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The artefacts were found in the underwater vestiges of Herakleum
and Menouthis, off the coast of the town of Canopus, which lie just
east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta, Frank Goddio told a news
conference held in the port city.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported that a team of divers led
by Goddio discovered the treasures in two years of exploration and
excavation, during which they found the remains of the ancient
Greek town of Herakleum, where the Greek God Hercules was
worshiped, Goddio said.
</P>
<P>
The finds included statues, sphinxes and columns from ancient
Egypt, some dating to the 26th dynasty (seventh century BC) and the
30th dynasty (fourth century BC), he added. Coins from the
Byzantine and Islamic eras were also found.
</P>
<P>
He termed the discovery as a key step in helping unravel the
ancient Egyptian civilization drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Herakleum is the second city which was found deep in the
Mediterranean water after Menouthis was discovered in 1934. They
were among six cities which were built in the Greek era (332 BC to
305 BC) and sank into the sea in a major earthquake in ancient
times.
