<HEADLINE> Israel Licenses Five Oil Drills off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
awarded the first five licenses to drill for oil in the Israeli
deep waters in the Mediterranean, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The winning consortium, headed by Avner Oil and Gas Ltd.,
intends to drill off the coast at unspecified locations between
Haifa and the Gaza Strip by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The first stage is to find further financial and technical
partners, followed by a seismic study of the area between October
and December, according to Avner's Managing Director Eli
Rosenberg. "Drilling will hopefully begin before the end of
1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg dismissed suggestions that the total cost of the
project will be around 1 billion U.S. dollars. He estimated that
the initial drilling, at a 1,500 meter-depth, will cost 25 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's deep waters appear to be very promising," said the
government's Director of Petroleum Research, Dr. Yehezkel
Druckman, who granted the licenses.
</P>
<P>
This confidence stems from the results of previous drillings
in the nearby shallow waters by Isramco in the early 1990s, which
suggested the area is oil rich.
</P>
<P>
Avner, together with Delek Kiduchim and Enserch Middle East,
had to be granted five licenses to carry out the project, because
each only covers 400 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
While experts agree that the area could prove lucrative, there
is a variance of opinion as to how much oil is needed to make the
operation economically viable. Druckman suggested a minimum of
3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day while others believe more would be
needed.
</P>
<P>
"For a successful well in that depth of water, they need
thousands of barrels," said Yaron Ran, the managing director of
Israel National Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
Avner, which claims the support of many international oil
companies, said a former vice-president of the world's largest
publicly owned oil company, Exxon Corporation, described the
prospects as "world-class."
