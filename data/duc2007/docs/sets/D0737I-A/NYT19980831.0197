DEEP SEA EXPLORER MAY TAKE RESEARCH TO NEW LOW

<P>
   The sea has millions of dark secrets. And now, a famous explorer
is to illuminate more of them.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a third of a century, Alvin, the world's first
craft to roam the abyss with relative ease, has been ferrying
American scientists into the planet's sunless depths and racking up
a staggering record of discovery, including dark ecosystems that,
with riots of tube worms and other bizarre creatures, rival rain
forests in richness.
</P>
<P>
   But the plucky, white, 25-foot-long craft has its shortcomings.
Most notably, it can plunge down only so far without the deep's
pressures suddenly crushing its crew capsule (and three occupants).
For dives, the safety limit is 2.8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That distance is little more than the sea's average depth and
far short of its deepest spot, seven miles down, much lower than
Everest is high. The upshot is that a large part of the seabed,
with its dark recesses and riddles and perhaps even a den or two of
undiscovered monsters, is out of Alvin's reach. Off limits is an
area larger than Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Alvin is getting a major overhaul that may extend its
reach and allow it to match and possibly even surpass newer
submersibles abroad, making it the world leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War, the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has just received
from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which has been
decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and changing
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Woods Hole and its federal patrons have insufficient money to
run Sea Cliff, designed for military work, as a separate vehicle.
But Woods Hole is happy to cannibalize its parts to improve Alvin,
a process now getting under way. The trove is rich. Alvin cost
about $50 million, and Sea Cliff about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The crown jewel of Sea Cliff is its crew capsule. The walls are
made of a thick layer of super-strong titanium that can withstand
pressures down to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers). So Woods
Hole is now studying whether the capsule can be transferred to
Alvin, a move that would extend the reach of the tiny submersible
by a full mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to make sure it's the best,'' Dr.
Robert B. Gagosian, the director of Woods Hole, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to push even deeper and capitalize on the politics of the
moment, the institution is seeing whether further strengthening
would allow Alvin to plunge down to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7
kilometers) _ deeper than any of the rival submersibles now
operated by Russia, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the leaders in exploration,'' Dr. Gagosian said.
``In order to continue that tradition, we need to have the
deepest-diving submersible. It's that simple. We want to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say major questions of geology, biology and even
archaeology now lie beyond Alvin's current reach, not to mention
the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's important science to be done'' in the sea's deeper
regions, said Dr. Daniel J. Fornari, head scientist for the deep
submergence program at Woods Hole. ``It's such a compelling part of
the planet. We've got this sitting in our backyard and we know so
little about it. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Alvin users have been the first to glimpse the
seabed's dark ecosystems, its hot chimneys, its cold seeps, its
rocky chains of mountains longer than the Andes and its lost human
worlds, such as the Titanic. The explorers have also brought to
light thousands of new species of animal life, including slimy
things seemingly fit for monster movies.
</P>
<P>
   This record of ongoing excellence is causing some of the
submersible's users to view any renovations warily.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is clear,'' said Richard F. Pittenger, head of
marine operations at Woods Hole. ``We don't want to screw up the
reliability in the process of trying to make the submersible
better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alvin was first proposed by Woods Hole in the 1960s, it was
considered a curiosity. Most military officials and scientists of
the day cared little about people exploring the deep. No regular
Navy contractor wanted job. So the submersible was built by General
Mills, the maker of breakfast cereals.
</P>
<P>
   The situation changed after a Navy submarine, the Thresher, sank
with 129 men in 1963. Its wreckage remained lost for months. In the
catastrophe's wake, the Navy decided to throw itself into mastering
the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   No expense was too great. The Navy built two Alvin look-alikes,
Sea Cliff and Turtle. Both were heavier and faster than their
forerunner. Eventually, in 1984, Sea Cliff dove much deeper, with
its stronger crew capsule.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign submersibless began to rival Sea Cliff's
maximum depth of 3.8 miles and to make new discoveries. In 1990,
the Japanese pulled ahead with a new submersible that plunged down
4 miles. Woods Hole scientists looked on sheepishly in 1994 as the
Japanese submersible, Shinkai 6500, set an Atlantic depth record.
Today, the 31-foot-long Japanese submersible is still unrivaled.
</P>
<P>
   Such competitive pressure is one reason Woods Hole is eager to
have Alvin go deeper. The more important reason is raw knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the inky deep is not only inherently provocative
but important to understand if people are to be good planetary
stewards. It is the Earth's largest habitat, containing, by some
estimates, 97 percent of the space inhabited by living things.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the planet's lifeblood. Its voluminous waters supply
vital elements that sustain life on the surface and regulate
planetary heat flow, keeping the land temperate.
</P>
<P>
   Geologically, the deep is the planet's most dynamic feature, the
place where huge slabs of crust are created and destroyed. About 90
percent of the Earth's volcanism happens undersea.
</P>
<P>
   Gagosian, the Woods Hole director, said a deeper-diving Alvin
could better study these cauldrons, which also support lush
ecosystems and are suspected of being the place where life arose
four billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper-diving Alvin, he said, could not only explore the sites
directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to
track distant seaquakes. A great opportunity for such wiring lies
in old telephone cables that criss-cross the sea's abyssal plains,
Gagosian said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, one such cable between California and Hawaii is to
be lifted from a depth of 3.1 miles and fitted with geologic
detectors _ an oceanographic first. A deeper Alvin could service
such devices, eliminating the need for lifting the cable, which is
a risky job.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity's
lost worlds. The luxury liner, Titanic, resting at a depth of more
than two miles, is now within Alvin's reach and was visited in 1986
by the tiny white submersible, but thousands of other wrecks lie
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   One is the I-52, a Japanese submarine sunk in World War II while
carrying a shipment of two tons of gold, 146 bars of it packed in
metal boxes. Discovered in 1995 more than three miles down on the
Atlantic abyssal plain, the I-52 wreckage is now slated for further
exploration as the salvage team searches for vehicles than can go
that deep.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of Sea Cliff are already being transferred to Alvin. The
first to go was the military submersible's digital sonar.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie B. Walden, manager of deep submergence at Woods Hole,
said incorporating Sea Cliff's crew capsule into Alvin might cost
$15 million, a sum as yet unapproved by federal planners. He said
the upgrade could be done during the sub's next major overhaul,
which is scheduled for the end of 2000, allowing it to start the
new millennium on an auspicious note.
</P>
<P>
   With Alvin diving to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers), the
region outside its reach would shrink dramatically, contracting
from something larger than Asia to the size of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gagosian, eager for even greater penetration of the sea's
darkness, has asked Woods Hole experts to assess the feasibility of
Alvin's plunging to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers). But
achieving that may take more than Sea Cliff's sphere, and might
cost $100 million _ big money in a field that gets about $20
million a year in federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists feel such money is unlikely to materialize. But
others are hopeful, saying that the potential returns are huge and
the cost is extraordinarily low compared with other Federal science
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way underfunded,'' Fornari said of the nation's efforts
at deep exploration, still led by Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appalling how little it gets and how much gets done.''
