<HEADLINE> Clinton Names New Undersea Projects  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Video screens displayed fantastical pictures
of otherworldly landscapes below the waves and beyond the sun
Monday as President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
hosted the latest in a series of White House lectures on science,
arts and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session on space and sea exploration featured gee-whiz
science demonstrations and scientists' musings on what future
explorations might yield. Schoolchildren asked questions in person
and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must continue as a nation to set out for new frontiers,
whether under the sea or into the heavens,'' Clinton said at the
start of the 90-minute session. ''We must continue to try to
conquer the seemingly impossible, to discover the unimaginable, to
find out more about what's out there, and in the process about
ourselves and what's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced federal participation in three new undersea
exploration projects: A deep-water canyon off the coasts of New
York and New Jersey; reefs deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico off
Florida's Gulf Coast; and an ocean mountain range off California.

<P>
   He also directed the Commerce Department to form an advisory
panel of scientists to recommend priorities and goals for new ocean
exploration. A report is due in four months.
</P>

   Although oceans cover some 70 percent of the Earth's surface,
scientists estimate that 90 percent of that space remains unknown
to humans. Clinton and scientists predicted Monday that some of the
organisms found in those depths might one day provide medical cures
or lessons for industry and human development.

<P>
   Pictures of those creatures -- brightly colored tube worms that
live near undersea volcanoes and diaphanous scribbles floating in
the deep -- flashed on the eight thin, high-tech screens set against
the gilded splendor of the White House East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fidgeted at times but also looked amazed as two
prominent scientists, undersea explorer Marcia McNutt of
California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Neil de
Grasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, traded
what-ifs about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The lecture was the ninth of a program conceived by Mrs. Clinton
as part of the White House millennium year commemoration.
