<HEADLINE> Chinese Robot Explores Ocean Floor at 6,000-Meter Depth </HEADLINE>

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in building
and utilizing a robot recently to survey Pacific Ocean depths of
6,000 meters, according to today's "Economic Information Daily."
</P>
<P>
The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this
high-tech sector, experts said. Exploration of the ocean floor at
6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations.
</P>
<P>
Survey technology at such depths -- considered by some to be
more sophisticated than space technology -- must cope with
atmospheric pressure 600 times that at sea level. In addition,
oceanic research robots must adjust to unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record,
measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water
conditions and search for missing objects while automatically
recording data, according to the report.

<P>
A special group of experts for the robot project also expressed
satisfaction with the cable-less robot's quality and reliability.
