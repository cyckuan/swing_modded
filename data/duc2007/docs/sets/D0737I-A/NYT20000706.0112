   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ In September 1999, a storm hit Lake George
that wasn't quite as perfect as the one you can watch at the movies
these days, but for an inland tempest, it was as good as they get.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities who oversee Lake George say 150 boats were
sunk when Tropical Storm Floyd was over, and all have been
recovered. Divers, however, say it might have been more like 200.
</P>
<P>
   That difference of 50 boats is the stuff lake-bottom lore is
made of.
</P>
<P>
   If any boats sunk last fall remain under water, none have been
spotted _ and with big fines likely, any owner of a still-swamped
boat would probably prefer to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion persists that a bevy of cabin cruisers are
waiting to be found, at rest among the sloops, the treasure chests
and even the sea monsters that live in the imaginations of lake
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   What is true, however, is that over the centuries ships have
gone down to storms and in battles; others were deliberately
scuttled in the days before strict laws forbade such sinkings.
</P>
<P>
   One vessel, a 15-foot homemade submarine built to study French
and Indian War wrecks, was stolen from its dock in 1960 before it
even made a trial run. Its fate was one of the lake's big mysteries
until 1995, when Bateaux Below divers found the rusted hulk in deep
water, midlake. Mystery half-solved: No one can say how it got
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bateaux Below, a Saratoga Springs-based diving group that
studies Lake George, has undertaken a lake-bottom inventory that
might, over the next decade or so, take the guesswork out of many
such tales of the deep. But here are some mysteries that endure:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the deep water along the ``narrows'' at midlake, a 60-foot
sailing vessel with a 65-foot mast is believed to be submerged, its
sides collapsed, an open safe lying next to the wreck. Its
existence is not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is said that a treasure chest was found by two divers south
of Diamond Island, near where the Forward wreck lies. Divers say
the chest is sunk in 120 feet of water and some continue to search
for it today, but others note that waters off the island do not
exceed 110 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1850s, a storm took down a three-mast sailing vessel
(known as a ``bark'') in the middle of the lake with its full crew
aboard. One man jumped off before the storm became too powerful,
and lived to tell a tale of violent winds and a crew member who
tied himself to the mast to ride out the storm. The ship has never
been found.
</P>
<P>
   _ The British vessel Halifax, a sloop-of-war, disappeared and
may be somewhere in Lake George. Over 50 feet long, it participated
in both the 1758 Abercrombie expedition and the 1759 Amherst
expedition. Some historians believe it was dragged ashore and left
to rot.
</P>
<P>
   _ What ever became of the Ganouskie? The steamboat was a lake
attraction in the mid-19th century, then retired and moored at Big
Burnt Island, where it was a floating bar. When the bar failed, it
is said the ship was scuttled in deep water off Dome Island, near
Bolton Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Divers are still making discoveries in Lake George. But surely,
some of the wrecks that divers hunt for never did exist. And with
the Bateaux Below survey poised to identify everything on the lake
floor, those nonexistent wrecks may be the most thrilling to hunt
for in years to come _ for divers who thrive on mystery.
