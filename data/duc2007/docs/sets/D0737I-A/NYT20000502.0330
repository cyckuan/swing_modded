CRACKED EASTERN SEABED MAY CAUSE HUGE WAVES, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In waters off Virginia and North Carolina, scientists have found
cracks in the seabed that might set off a tsunami, they say,
sending waves as high as 20 feet speeding toward the mid-Atlantic
states.
</P>
<P>
   Neal W. Driscoll of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute,
Jeffrey K. Weissel of Columbia University and John A. Goff of the
University of Texas said in an article in the May issue of the
journal Geology that the recently discovered cracks could mean the
continental shelf was unstable and could slide down like an
avalanche, inducing the giant waves.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said they discovered the cracks about 60 miles
from shore along a 25-mile section of the continental shelf off the
Virginia and North Carolina coasts. If the seabed there gave way,
they said, the reaction could set off the giant waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a societal perspective, we need to evaluate the degree of
tsunami hazard that might be posed by a major submarine
landslide,'' the scientists wrote. And they plan to find out if the
cracks ``are fossil features or are active and likely to produce a
potentially disastrous, large submarine slide in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are leaving this weekend on a 14-day expedition
to gather more data to assess the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sensationalize this,'' Driscoll said in an
interview. ``The risk associated with these cracks is finite.
First, we have to determine if they're geologically active, then
whether they're moving on human time sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The long fissures were found 325 to 650 feet beneath the waves
and lie perched close to the edge of the outer continental shelf,
where the seabed becomes gradually deeper and then quickly gives
way to the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Never before, the scientists said, have cracks so large been
seen, although hints of smaller ones have cropped up in undersea
data.
</P>
<P>
   If the danger of the cracks proves real, the scientists said,
coastal areas of North Carolina, southern Virginia and the lower
Chesapeake Bay would be at risk for wave heights similar to the
surge of a category 4 hurricane, which is characterized by top
sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a tsunami can come with no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Such sudden events are not unknown. In 1929, a submarine
landslide associated with an earthquake on the Grand Banks set off
a tsunami that killed 51 people along the coast of Newfoundland.
The waves from that event were estimated to range in height from 3
to 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunamis are often larger than predicted from the force of
earthquakes alone, suggesting that submarine landslides play an
important role in their generation, the scientists said. In 1998, a
tsunami in Papua New Guinea killed 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists plan to make images of the cracks with sonar
waves, and then take deep samples of the seabed to see if the
cracks are fresh or covered with layers of sediment. The latter
finding would suggest that the cracks were geologically inactive
and a low threat of producing giant waves.
