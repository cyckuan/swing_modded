<HEADLINE> Russian Sub Sinks Into Seabed, Rescue Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The crippled Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk with its trapped crew of 118 is slowly sinking
deeper into the Barents Sea floor, although rescue is still
possible, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This process is very slow and does not significantly impact on
the rescue operation," the Interfax news agency quoted Dygalo as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules
are trying to attach, so far in vain, remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the weather conditions, the attempts to dock with the
submarine have once again failed," Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
Weather has somewhat improved but a fresh breeze continues to
blow and there is still fog and drizzle on the surface.
</P>
<P>
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working
deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Russian
Navy press service said.
</P>
<P>
As rescue efforts continue, experts are analyzing video and
photo materials picturing the damage done to the bow of the sub.
The accident reportedly happened last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is estimated as being critical," the press
service stressed.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ships on the surface were involved in the rescue
bid.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated submarine was commissioned for the Russian Navy
in 1995. It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive
to depths of up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with
torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate
autonomously for up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and
Norway in the rescue bid. It had earlier refrained from seeking
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers
from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the
site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue
craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin called British Prime Minister
Tony Blair Thursday and the two discussed the rescue operation,
Putin's senior aide Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
They discussed concrete aspects of the rescue efforts,
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors
and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
The offer was extended Wednesday through the German embassy in
Moscow and to Russian Navy command officers holding consultations
at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on assisting in the rescue of
the crew of the sunken sub, Interfax reported, quoting diplomatic
sources in Moscow.
