   When Sharon Gretz Lasky found out she had melanoma last August,
she wasn't ready to surrender to cancer. ``I didn't want to feel
powerless, like a rock rolling down a hilt,'' said the 42-year-old
mother of three. ``I wanted to be in charge of my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, her treatment consisted not only of surgery to remove
a block of tissue from her thigh and lymph nodes, but also of
acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Lasky was able to get top-notch conventional and
alternative care under one roof. After her cancer was diagnosed,
she began treatment at the three-year-old Center for Complementary
Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside
Hospital. The same health-care network that featured her oncologist
and plastic surgeon for tissue reconstruction also included an
acupuncturist, a massage therapist and other alternative
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who worked with me _ the surgeons, the acupuncturist,
the nutritionist and the rest _ were part of my health-care team,''
she said. ``They treated my cancer, but they also helped me through
my fears, so I went into surgery incredibly calm and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lasky got help in dealing with pain and
recuperation _ and the news that she'd need a second operation to
remove a spot from her lung. Thankfully, the tissue in her lung
proved noncancerous, and she left the hospital in half the expected
time and with much less pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   This integrative approach to treating an illness certainly isn't
new. But the fact that Lasky was able to get multifaceted treatment
at a single facility is indicative of a growing trend in health
care: the integrative medicine facility. Across the country, an
ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care
organizations are setting up complementary-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, no one is tracking these centers as a group, but last
year, the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9
percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services; some
estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers
affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors
and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each
patient's course of treatment. Others offer individual therapies
such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what was happening even a few years ago, the
extent to which complementary services have become part of the
health-care system is astonishing,'' said John Weeks, editor and
publisher of The Integrator, a newsletter covering the business of
alternative medicine. ``We're really in the first phase of a
process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions
for themselves, this trend is really going to take off,'' said Dr.
Samuel Benjamin, director of the Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York, Stony
Brook. ``There will be only one medicine in the future, and it will
include all of the things that we once thought of as either
alternative or conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, demographics support the notion that these centers
are here to stay. ``Baby boomers are hearing that they could live
to 80 or 90 or 100, and they want to be healthy doing it,'' Weeks
said.
</P>
<P>
   An expected squeeze in the labor market in the next several
years should prompt companies to seek more and better services with
which to attract and retain employees. At the top of any worker's
list: better health care. ``Patients are going to demand more
complementary medicine, and they're going to demand it right in the
hospital they're using,'' said Dr. James N. Dillard, medical
director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient
care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative
medicine: the information shortfall. Patients often use alternative
therapies in a smorgasbord-like way, without a complete
understanding of the advantages or risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what got me into the development of our center is that
I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies,'' said
Dr. Mimi Guarneri, an interventional cardiologist and the medical
director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La
Jolla, Calif. ``They were out there buying every vitamin and herb
they could find, and I was concerned that they might not know
enough about what they were taking.''
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to
inform patients about various alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly
skeptical about complementary approaches, many clinics have also
made research and analysis part of their standard operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye,
there's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought
into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense,'' said
Guarneri. ``As a physician, you can't stand up and present
anecdotes without being thrown out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share
that information with other hospitals nationwide. Many centers are
conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual
therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one,
is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George
Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in
Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating
carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what matters to patients isn't hard-core data but
real-life outcomes. And in that respect, the news is positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many complementary therapies can help people face an illness
more calmly, use less pain medication and recover more quickly,''
said Dr. Lewis Mehl-Medrona, program director for the Pittsburgh
medical center and the author of ``Coyote Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Cunning definitely agreed. The 35-year-old research
assistant received therapeutic touch and massage at the Center for
Health &AMP; Well-Being at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
while undergoing knee surgery at the hospital. (She also had
acupuncture treatments at an unaffiliated center nearby, with her
doctor's blessing.)
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after her surgery, she put away the crutches she'd
been given; by the third day, she'd tossed her pain pills, having
taken only six of the 30 that had been prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was very supportive,'' she recalled. ``I sailed
through surgery and was up and moving around much more quickly than
I'd expected. I think the care I was given made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   THE INSURANCE QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Will the fact that so many hospitals are bringing complementary
therapies under one roof mean less out-of-pocket costs for
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not _ at least, not right away, said Dr. James N.
Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health
Plans in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these centers are opening will put pressure on
insurers to pay for more things,'' he said. ``But that will take
time. Right now, we're seeing very few insurers paying for any
alternative medical treatment beyond chiropractic, which is
licensed in all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   But chiropractic is the one treatment that most of these centers
have the hardest time offering, he said. ``Most academic medical
centers freak out at the mere mention of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave consumers? ``You'll see massage offered
at most of the centers, but most insurers won't pay for it,''
Dillard said. At best, you'll get a discounted rate.
</P>
<P>
   How about acupuncture, therapeutic touch or nutritional
counseling? ``Maybe,'' he said. ``But it's still not too common, no
matter where it's provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies are motivated by numbers, he explained,
meaning they will pay for treatments that are cost-effective. So
the pressure is on the complementary-care centers to track patient
outcomes and prove to insurers that alternative treatments work as
well as _ or better than _ conventional treatments in managing
disease and keeping costs down.
