   Acupuncture appears to help some cocaine addicts escape their
dependence on the drug, according to a report published Tuesday by
researchers at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on drug abuse say cocaine addiction is one of the most
difficult forms of drug dependency to treat. And while many
treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time,
usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of
its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yale study, 53.8 percent of the subjects who had needles
inserted in four acupuncture ``zones'' in the ear five times a week
tested free of cocaine at the end of the eight-week study period.
In comparison, 23.5 percent of control subjects given ``sham''
acupuncture treatments and 9.1 percent of subjects who watched
relaxation videos tested free of the drug during the final week of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report appears in the August issue of the journal Archives
of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 82 men and women in the New Haven area who
were addicted to both heroin and cocaine. They were receiving
methadone treatment for the heroin addiction but were still using
cocaine regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the subjects, however, were dropped from the study
after missing sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers called the findings promising but cautioned that
the study was relatively small and that more research needed to be
done to confirm the results.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that acupuncture was not a panacea and suggested
that it should be used along with other therapies like counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are a difficult group of people to deal with,'' said Dr.
Herbert Kleber, the medical director of the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York and a professor of
psychiatry at Columbia University, who is familiar with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have medicine for treating cocaine addiction, and
acupuncture appears to be a useful adjunct for decreasing
dependence,'' Kleber said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Margolin, a research scientist in the department of
psychiatry at Yale's medical school and lead author of the report,
said that among the benefits of acupuncture were its low cost and
lack of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike pharmaceutical treatments, Margolin said, it can be
offered to pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings are also encouraging, he added, because
``they suggest that with the proper groundwork we can conduct
rigorous trials of complementary or alternative therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle that has confronted researchers trying to determine
whether acupuncture works has been the difficulty of finding
convincing ``placebo'' treatments to act as scientific controls.
For the sham needle treatment, the Yale researchers inserted four
needles along the rim of the ear, in spots that are not commonly
used in acupuncture treatment and had little effect when stimulated
in preliminary tests. The relaxation tapes were used to control for
the possibility that simply sitting quietly for 45 minutes in a
darkened room might itself produce an effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the acupuncture treatment, the needles were inserted five
times a week for about 45 minutes per session, according to
guidelines developed at Lincoln Hospital in New York, and adopted
by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association.
</P>
<P>
   Urine samples were taken three times a week to test for cocaine
use. All the subjects in the study, which was financed by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, also received psychotherapy as
part of the treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   Margolin said that scientists did not yet understand how
acupuncture might work to curb addiction but that there were a
variety of theories. For example, acupuncture has been linked to
the release of opioids, the body's natural painkillers, which might
help reduce the craving for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Or the procedure might stimulate the vagus nerve that runs
through the center of the ear, producing a relaxing effect.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese medicine, Margolin added, the stimulation points used
in the study are associated with a diagnosis called ``empty fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good either metaphorical or literal
description of a cocaine-addicted individual,'' he said.
