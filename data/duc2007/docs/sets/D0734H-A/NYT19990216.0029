   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pain, tough for anyone to beat, attacked
Esther Levow like one of her meanest karate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, while in her early 20s, Levow nearly died when
a doctor gave her painkillers during an operation. Since then,
she's been terrified to take any pain relievers during medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my heart stop,'' says Levow, a third-degree karate black
belt who otherwise is no shrinking violet. ``It's a little scary to
have that happen... I just want to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Levow resorted to an unusual counterpunch recently when told
she needed dental surgery: acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   And she isn't alone. With an increasing number of patients
reporting pain, fear and experiences like hers, local doctors have
become more open-minded about the blending of conventional and
alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a test,'' Levow recalls. ``After (the acupuncturist) put
the needles in, she stuck a needle directly into my gum to see what
would happen. I felt almost nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced she could use this alternative in her dentist's chair,
Levow got permission from Delray Beach, Fla. dentist Dr. Hyman
Friedman to bring the acupuncturist to his office. Before the
scaling, scraping and pulling he was to perform, the acupuncturist
_ Simm Gottesman of Deerfield Beach, Fla. _ carefully placed
needles on the side of Levow's face, her ear, and her hand to ease
her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt more than a bearable discomfort,'' Levow said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not work with every patient, but I was impressed,''
the dentist says.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the movement toward so-called ``alternative''
treatments may be driven by economics. Dr. David Eisenberg, an
assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, led a survey
that found a sharp increase in the use of alternative medicine by
Americans from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever doctors' motivation, bastions of conventionality such
as The American Medical Association are taking alternatives
seriously. The AMA devoted the entire November issue of its journal
to alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road from Jupiter Medical Center, where patients
undergo CAT scans and other high-tech medical procedures, the new
Mind/Body Institute offers alternative treatments from hydrotherapy
to acupuncture to therapeutic touch.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real competition here between conventional and
alternative healing methods: The center is a department of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 300 medical institutions are employing mind/body centers
in this country,'' says John Fritz, executive director of the new
institute. ``We feel we'll be able to show others how to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician serves as medical director for the institute,
reviewing most patient's cases for appropriate treatment. Fritz
admitted it took some meeting of the minds before the medical
center's doctors were comfortable with the institute's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which opened in November, was a gift to the
hospital from Guy and Jackie Fiske, area residents whose son is a
cancer researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are either referred by doctors or come in on their own.
And they're not always dealing with intractable pain, which drives
many to seek alternative care. The institute offers programs for
weight reduction, smoking cessation, and insomnia, Fritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the institute is part of the hospital, Fritz thinks it
might make people more comfortable seeking alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people would like to know more about what's
available, but they may not have a place to go they can trust,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And trust is a precious commodity, especially when treating
patients with chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   A-h-h-h-h.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cottrill lets out an explosive sigh.
</P>
<P>
   She is being treated for her chronic pain by Brett Ferrigan, a
licensed acupuncturist who isn't a medical doctor, but is certified
in Florida to perform the age-old treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He works at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach.
It's on the campus of St. Mary's Hospital but is a separate
corporation and operates independently. The center has offered
alternative treatments for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrill has acute pain from an operation 10 years ago that was
followed by a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain changes you,'' she says, as Ferrigan strategically places
acupuncture needles in her feet and hands to relieve her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Gardens resident has been through many medical
procedures for pain, she said, even nerve blocks. But results
varied. She tried acupuncture when her doctor suggested it.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrigan sticks a needle in the big toe of her right foot. When
the ``blocked energy'' that Ferrigan blames for the pain is
released, Cottrill flinches again, as if someone has clamped a
cardiac paddle on her chest and yelled, ``clear.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the acupuncture brings relief where conventional
painkillers haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come primarily for pain,'' says Ferrigan, who has
started getting referrals from St. Mary's doctors. ``I like working
in a medical setting. It's very gratifying for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of partnership is growing.
</P>
<P>
   A task force from the National Institutes of Health found
acupuncture, a component of the Chinese health care system that can
be traced back at least 2,500 years, was ``widely practiced'' and
that ``promising results have emerged'' for nausea, vomiting and
post-operative dental pain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, a
12-year-old society of medical doctors trained in acupuncture, has
seen its membership grow from 200 in 1991 to 1,550 today.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Barice, an Ivy League-trained doctor, practices her
skills on military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Barice works part-time at the Veteran's Administration Medical
Center in West Palm Beach. She's a longtime supporter of
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treating VA patients more than a year with
acupuncture. I've heard nothing but good things from patients,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some open-minded people in administration, good
supportive leaders. And they also recognize that when you're
working with chronic pain patients, and nothing has really relieved
that suffering, it's a useful adjunctive tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until not that long ago, doctors mistrusted chiropractors and
were resisting things they didn't know,'' Barice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are jumping on the bandwagon for a number of
reasons. Profit motivation, or patients want it. It's almost a
shotgun marriage in a lot of places between alternative and
traditional medicine.''
