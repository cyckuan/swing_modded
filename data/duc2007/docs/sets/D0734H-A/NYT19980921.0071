ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE GAINS ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WORKMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 70 percent of Americans now turn to
alternative forms of medicine _ from acupuncture to tai chi and
guided imagery _ to cure their ills when regular medicine has
failed, according to a nationwide survey released at Stanford
University.

<P>
   The random telephone survey of 1,000 people also showed that 56
percent of those interviewed believe their health plans should
cover alternative care. They are also willing to pay for it in
their medical insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see from this survey and many other indicators is that
people generally want to take control of their own health, using
those services they find most effective,'' said William Haskell, a
Stanford professor of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This places responsibility on both traditional care providers
and health educators to ensure that responsible information and
advice are available to patients,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative
medicine in the United States, it said roughly half the people who
seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine
for basic health care. On average, participants in the study made
four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, those surveyed said that their decision whether
to consult a conventional physician or a practitioner of
alternative medicine, was guided principally by the practitioner's
``technical skills at diagnosis and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were released at a conference on alternative and
complementary medicine held last week at Stanford Medical Center
and attended by more than 500 physicians and other health care
professionals from across the nation. The survey was conducted by
the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.

   Haskell is the principal investigator for Stanford in a major
federally funded study of the effectiveness of complementary and/or
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School
revealed that 1 in 3 Americans used nontraditional medicine,
spending $14 billion a year in treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford findings did not include patient expenditures for
alternative medicine. But, on average, survey respondents said they
would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 a month in health
insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage
or acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   While many physicians are still skeptical of alternative
medicine, a growing number of patient care organizations offer
complementary services in clinics alongside traditional medicine or
reimburse patients for alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in alternative medicine presents some challenges
and obligations for traditional physicians, said Wes Alles of the
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we are talking about vitamins, yoga, acupuncture,
massage or a variety of other practices, physicians should be
candid with their patients about which techniques they feel are
most appropriate for each patient,'' he said.
