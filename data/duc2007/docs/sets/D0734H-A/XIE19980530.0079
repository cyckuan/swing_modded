<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicines Gaining More Popularity World-wide </HEADLINE>

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese herbal medicines are now
selling 10 to 15 billion U.S. dollars worth, two to three times
the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
This trade amounts to 10 to 15 percent of the world's total,
according to Prof. Zhang Boli, director of a traditional medicine
institute in Tianjin.

<P>
Prof. Zhang told a national medical symposium today that one of
the reasons for the increasing popularity is that people are
becoming more concerned about the side-effects of other medicines
and are looking for alternatives. Another reason is that new
medicines need a lot of time and money to develop.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 170 companies and many research institutes
developing herbal medicines world-wide. Zhang said that some
European and North American countries now account for about a
quarter of the natural medicine use, and the former Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe account for 32 percent, while China consumes
nearly half.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has also put traditional medicine development on its
agenda and has built 26 traditional medicine centers. In 1980, it
announced 43 diseases that it considered suitable for treatment by
acupuncture and moxibustion, and one branch has published a
guidebook on herbal medicines.
