   &LR; NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. _ Frank Ruiz, on parole for possession
of heroin, cocaine and guns, was shocked when his parole officer
told him he could stay sober with needles.
</P>
<P>
   But three times a week the 39-year-old Panorama City man is
jabbed with five acupuncture needles in each ear, and he said it
has kept him away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for that program, I'd be back in prison,'' said
Ruiz, who has been on parole and sober for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Wait a minute. I was trying to get away from needles
and you guys are trying to get them in me?' '' he said. ``It is
really different but it works out pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 98 volunteers who have participated in the pilot program
since May, four have been re-arrested including one on suspicion of
drug sales, said Roy Chaney, the unit supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we have to chase people down. A lot of drug addicts
will be evasive. But these guys will come _ rain, sleet or snow _
and they like coming in,'' Chaney said. ``And they're losing their
craving for alcohol and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jails and clinics throughout the nation have used the ancient
Chinese practice to successfully treat substance abusers. But the
Van Nuys program is the only one of its kind within the parole
division of the Department of Corrections in California, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment keeps parolees out of jail, it could be
expanded throughout Los Angeles County, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any other programs working with outpatient
parolees to keep them out of jail. We're helping to keep them
out,'' said Joseph Acquah, the acupuncturist and Oriental medical
doctor who treats parolees throughout the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: half-inch needles are inserted in the
parolee's ears at points that correspond to the lungs, liver,
kidneys and nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the treatment triggers the release of chemicals
including endorphins, which helps curb drug cravings, withdrawals
and promotes relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, and they believe it works, then let them use
it,'' said Mike d'Agostine, supervisor of criminal justice services
at the Tarzana Treatment Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clients at the Tarzana center have also been treated
with acupuncture for substance abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I saw a benefit to it. It allows some people to
relax more and decrease their anxiety,'' d'Agostine said.
</P>
<P>
   But other forms of treatment are also needed in conjunction with
the acupuncture, he said. The Van Nuys program lasts for at least
12 weeks and requires parolees to attend a drug counseling program
in conjunction with the acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   For Ruiz, acupuncture has meant he can hold down a job, sleep
through the night without drugs and improve his relationship with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dolores, can vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not down. He's alert and his eating is great,'' his wife
of 19 years said. ``The acupuncture really helped him out a lot.
Before, he was always sick if he didn't have what he needed.
Everything's getting back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Free of charge to parolees, the acupuncture treatment is a pilot
program at the Department of Corrections' Van Nuys office that
Chaney started in May. There is no set time limit for the pilot
program and the parolees come of their own will after being
informed about it through their parole agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that people have no more cravings for the drugs,''
Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after an acupuncture treatment program at Lincoln
Hospital, a New York City-owned facility in the impoverished South
Bronx, the Van Nuys program treats about 15 drug-plagued parolees
at a time about three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Often the parolees were convicted of other crimes, including
assaults, domestic violence and petty thefts, Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Haradin, 37, of Tujunga said acupuncture has pierced his
addiction to pain pills and stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no cravings. Your thinking's clear. You're more
aware. Your sense of smell and touch is more clear. Before, when I
would drive down the road, I was only focused on where I was going
and now I see everything that's around me,'' Haradin said, with
five needles sprouting from each of his ears.
</P>
<P>
   And he has doubled his productivity at work from three days to
six to seven days of work per week as a tub and spa installer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third session, I was hooked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parolee, who declined to give his name for fear of
hurting the night clubs he has owned for 28 years throughout the
Valley, said he too was hooked on the program after his first few
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a miracle,'' the man said while being treated last
week. ``I drank like a fish. ... Now, I don't touch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described alcoholic said he tried drinking scotch _
once his drink of choice _ after an acupuncture session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't taste the same. It was bitter, spicier. It didn't
come in right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man has a wine cellar at home that he now does not want to
touch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my house, I have every type of cognac and liquor you could
dream about,'' he said. ``I drink a lot of milk now. This is a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the program began, state corrections officials have seen
dramatic results: Parolees are getting jobs, maintaining healthy
relationships and showing up free of drugs after weekly tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a dedicated group of parolees. They've been testing
free and clear of drugs and alcohol. It's proving to be a viable
treatment,'' said Ivory Roberts, the district parole administrator
for the Valley.
