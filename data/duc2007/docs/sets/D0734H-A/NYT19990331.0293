   NEW YORK _ Some people spend hundreds of dollars on skin-care
products in attempts to regain a more youthful look and to smooth
wrinkles. They try creams, ointments and herbs, as well as plastic
surgery. Or acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, the 5,000-year-old Chinese healing practice, is
used in the United States not only for preventing and treating
diseases, relieving pain and anesthetizing patients for surgery,
but also for face-lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture has been used to improve appearance for at least two
decades in this country, for patients who do not want to undergo
surgery. But only some acupuncturists will do this.
</P>
<P>
   Many practitioners find the corrective work less professionally
satisfying than treating diseases and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture is based on the Chinese philosophy called Dao. Dao
is believed to be directly related to health and well-being,
moderation and harmony in mind and body. Practitioners seek to
restore this balance through Chi, or Qi, Shen and Jing.
</P>
<P>
   Chi is said to be the energy found in the heart and lungs, in
circulating blood and oxygen. The Shen is the soul, manifested in
personality, perception and awareness of self. The Jing is
responsible for growth, development and reproduction. According to
the philosophy, the acupuncturists' role is to help people balance
their life of excesses__stress, vices, bad diet__ to achieve a
long, healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   In an acupuncture face-lift, 36-millimeter needles are inserted
into facial muscles. These needles are believed to produce tiny
electric stimulation in anatomic points bringing the blood to the
surface, in this case, the face, for better circulation, said
Phyllis M. Shapiro, an acupuncturist licensed by New York State.
</P>
<P>
   In acupuncture, there are about 2,000 spots in the body, or
acupoints, used for different treatments. The points are connected
through 12 main channels, or meridians, according to
acupuncturists.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture ``can make the skin look healthier,'' by increasing
the blood flow to the tissues, Mitchell said, ``but can't produce
drastic changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acupuncturists say it is more stimulating treating patients
to restore their health rather than enhance appearance. ``There's
less diagnosis,'' said acupuncturist Craig Mitchell from Pacific
Institute of Oriental Medicine in New York. ``It's not necessary to
have a thorough interview'' with the patient if she wants to tone
up her face, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   For him as for other colleagues, using acupuncture as a tool for
healing is a more challenging job than making people feel good by
``pumping up'' their faces, said acupuncturist Cameron Bishop of
Western Communities Family Practice Association in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Face-lifts are ``like washing a car,'' Bishop said. ``It's
boring work. Would you rather wash a car or do something more
interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   For patients seeking a faster and more permanent alteration in
their appearance, plastic surgery is the best solution. Plastic
surgery is often recommended for patients who are 45 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery uses incisions to cut the loose skin and fat off
the face. ``It's not just stretching and pulling the skin,'' said
Minas Constantinides, who is a plastic surgeon who works on
face-lifts and is a member of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Face-lift surgery is an operation that costs between $7,000 and
$20,000 and it lasts for years. Acupuncture treatments would take
at least 10 weeks to show improvement and do not assure a permanent
physical change. But with acupuncture the treatment is much
cheaper, costing about $115 per session, at one session a week.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture is one of the least expensive ways to have a
face-lift without spending time and going through surgery trying to
look younger. And while some acupuncturists prefer an in-depth
diagnosis and a healing treatment, if they have to ``lift faces to
make people feel younger and happier'' they will do it, Bishop
said.
