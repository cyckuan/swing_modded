TIANJIN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical workers have
created and are ready to popularize an acupuncture therapy for
apoplexy, for which a cure is still lacking in Western medicine.

<P>
"Clinical application of the point prescriptions of 'Xingnao
Kaiqiao' have yielded positive results in curing apoplexy and its
syndromes, and other diseases such as coronary heart disease,
cholelithiasis, asthma, and sterility," officials with the State
Administration of Chinese Traditional Medicine said. "The method
is effective with 98.56 percent of the cases treated, and the cure
rate reaches 59.27 percent."
</P>
<P>
Invented by professor Shi Xueming, vice president of the
Chinese Acupuncture Society, the therapy has already been listed
as one of the top-ten traditional medical achievements this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the hospital working with Shi has set up some ten
centers across China to train medical workers in the practice of
this therapy.
</P>
<P>
The treatment has also been adopted in more than 80 countries
to treat apoplexy, and Japan, the United States, and the Republic
of Korea, among others, have also established special
organizations to explore and popularize this method.
