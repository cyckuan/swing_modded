<HEADLINE> Hospitals Embrace Alternative Care  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Beth Israel Medical Center, a large New York
teaching hospital, this month opened a funky looking facility --
complete with pastel-colored walls and a waiting room with fluffy
couches and a redwood bench -- where physicians work along side
chiropractors and practitioners who specialize in homeopathy and
clinical imagery.
</P>
<P>
   At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the most prestigious
hospitals in Los Angeles, cardiac patients are given the option of
receiving acupuncture or massage therapy after coronary bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, known for its
ground-breaking organ transplants, psychiatrists prescribe herbal
medicines to help patients overcome depression.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, the bastions of Western medicine and high-tech
gadgetry, are increasingly using procedures such as aromatherapy
and Tai Chi to try to attract patients by tapping into one of the
hottest trends in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Though the medical profession remains skeptical about the
effectiveness of alternative therapies, hospital administrators say
they can no longer escape the reality that millions of Americans
routinely use them to complement -- or even take the place of --
traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 million Americans are spending some $27 billion a year
on alternative care, according to a recent study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   With these patients and dollars in mind, about 13 percent of
U.S. hospitals provide alternative therapies, according to a survey
of about 1,000 hospitals by the consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
The figure rises to 25 percent for inner city hospitals and 32
percent for hospitals with at least 500 beds.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, it would have been almost unheard of for hospitals
to offer such services, industry analysts say. That's changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be silly for doctors and hospitals to ignore
something that will be a large part of health care for years to
come,'' said Dr. Matthew Fink, a neurologist who is president and
chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and the practitioners of alternative care don't
always mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors still are suspicious of alternative therapies and
consider chiropractors and acupuncturists to be quacks. And health
insurers are reluctant to pay for most alternative procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a move to
affiliate with a group of alternative care practitioners prompted a
firestorm of criticism from faculty members before the program got
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Despite occasional setbacks, alternative care providers and
medical practitioners are increasingly seeking to find common
ground to help their businesses prosper.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening at Beth Israel's Center for Health and
Healing, located on the second floor of a nondescript office
building in downtown Manhattan. The $5 million center, with 17
treatment rooms, has pastel-colored walls. The waiting room is
light and airy with fluffy couches, and there's a bench made from
recycled redwood in the reception area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are providing a wide range of therapeutic options of
remedies that have stood the test of time and/or scientific
scrutiny, and preferably both,'' said Dr. Woodson Merrell, the
center's executive director who is a physician and an
acupuncturist. ''I see integrative medicine as the future of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, opened in June, includes medical doctors, registered
nurses, nurse practitioners, psychotherapists and practitioners of
acupuncture, chiropractic procedures, mind-body therapy and massage
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel officials opened the center not only to tap into the
growing interest among consumers for alternative care but also to
conduct research to try to determine if these therapies -- some
practiced for thousands of years-- really do work, Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said some Beth Israel doctors were suspicious of the
center, especially orthopedic surgeons who are leery of
chiropractors. To win the specialists' support, the center has
agreed that after a patient sees a chiropractor three times, the
case must be reviewed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to get both sides to come to the table to work
together,'' Merrell said. ''It was like putting together disparate
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say alternative care providers gain credibility by
working with physicians and hospitals. And the doctors and medical
institutions are viewed as cutting edge for facilitating
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   Financial barriers remain, however, because there is limited
insurance coverage for alternative procedures. Beth Israel's center
so far has been unsuccessful in attracting an insurer for a pilot
project to test whether alternative therapies can save money and
provide good care, Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, support among physicians is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Fontana, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai,
uses acupuncture to relieve the neck pain he develops from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing first hand how the therapy works for him -- and concerned
that his own patients were not receiving effective treatment for
pain -- Fontana recently led a group of physicians to start a pilot
program to test acupuncture, massage therapy and guided-imagery
relaxation techniques on cardiac bypass patients. Early results on
about 100 patients show that nearly all reported some relief from
the services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As my practice evolved, I saw the frustrations of my patients
and came to the realization that Western medicine does not have all
the answers,'' Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana's study is just one area at Cedars-Sinai where there is
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital last year launched its Integrative Medicine group,
which offers such services as acupuncture and meditation as well as
physician services. Doctors are becoming involved because their
patients are asking about such procedures, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors fear they will lose patients if they do not know how
to talk to patients about alternative therapies,'' said Dr. Mary
Hardy, the group's medical director who is an internist and
specialist in herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New York and Los Angeles, hospitals in more conservative
areas of the country also are introducing alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   Central Iowa Health Systems last year opened the Center for
Health and Well Being in West Des Moines, Iowa. The center, which
treats allergies with Chinese herbs and back pain with acupuncture,
hopes the hospital name and logo will attract patients who are
hesitant to give these alternative services a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''We give patients more of a comfort level because they know
we've checked out these practitioners,'' said Sheila Gregan, the
center's director.
