Amnesty International calls for independent kidnapping probe

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Amnesty International human rights
group urged Indonesia on Monday to allow a fact-finding team to
investigate accusations that the military abducted and tortured
pro-democracy activists.
	   Dozens of activists were allegedly kidnapped by elite military
troops in the months before riots and protests forced former
autocratic leader President Suharto to quit in May.
	   Indonesian human rights workers say 14 are still missing. Some
fear they are dead.
	   Ten soldiers are to face courts-martial over the abductions. The
military last month dismissed former commander Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, over the affair.
	   To date only military tribunals have probed the kidnapping
cases.
	   However, Amnesty International campaigner Kerry Brogan said
those charged should be tried by a civilian court.
	   ``We urge the government to give access for an independent fact
finding team'' to question those allegedly involved, she told a
news conference.
	   She said the London-based group also wants the government of
President B.J. Habibie to reveal details of human rights abuses in
three troubled provinces, East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya, where
the military had cracked down on separatists.
	   Last week representatives of Amnesty, a longtime critic of the
former Suharto regime, held talks with Indonesia's armed forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto and his intelligence chiefs.
	   Brogan also urged Habibie to abolish an anti-subversion law
under which hundreds of dissidents were imprisoned for criticizing
the Suharto government.
	   Habibie has pledged major political reform and has released more
than 100 political prisoners, although some still remain behind
bars.
