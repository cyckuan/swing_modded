	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Amnesty International sought a High
Court injunction Wednesday to stop Gen. Augusto Pinochet fleeing
the country if the British government blocks his extradition to
Spain to face charges of genocide and torture.
	   The lawyers moved as speculation increased that Home Secretary
Jack Straw was close to announcing the decision he has to make by
Friday.
	   Amnesty International fears that if Straw blocks extradition,
the 83-year-old general will be whisked back to Chile before the
group can make a last bid to keep him in Europe.
	   Its first move would likely be to argue before a judge that any
decision by Straw to block extradition would be lawfully wrong.
	   ``We are asking the court to give us the opportunity to
challenge any decision he might make which is adverse to us,'' said
Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer for Amnesty International and other
human rights groups.
	   ``Effectively, we are seeking an injunction deferring
implementation of any adverse decision pending a challenge,''
Bindman said.
	   Meanwhile, the general's lawyers have complained that a
five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
that ruled 3-2 on Nov. 25 that Pinochet did not have immunity from
arrest is the head of Amnesty International fundraising arm.
	   Spain is seeking the general's extradition for killings and
torture by his security forces during his 17-year regime.
	   Pinochet, not seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest in a
London hospital, remained under police guard in a rented mansion at
Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Earlier, The Times of London reported that Straw had refused to
give Bindman any advance notice of his decision.
	   From the other side, lawyers for Pinochet may ask the House of
Lords to reconsider its decision because of Lord Justice Leonard
Hoffmann's connections to Amnesty International, British newspapers
reported Wednesday.
