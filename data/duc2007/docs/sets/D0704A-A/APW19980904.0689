Amnesty International alleges illegal detention camps
</HEADLINE>

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Amnesty International on Friday
demanded a government probe into what it said were unauthorized
detention camps run by two armed Tamil groups opposed to the
secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the London-based
human rights organization said the two groups were helping Sri
Lanka's military fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, known
as the LTTE.
	   ``In the last few years, Amnesty International has repeatedly
raised concern about the persistent practice on the part of the
army and the police in the north and east to allow (if not
encourage) members of armed Tamil groups opposed to the LTTE to
carry out search operations or screen civilians,'' Amnesty
International said in a statement.
	   The statement said the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil
Eelam and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization operated by more
than 20 detention camps.
	   Sri Lanka's government has introduced several measures to
safeguard the welfare of detainees, but Amnesty International said
the measures are enforced poorly, if at all.
	   The Tamil Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland in
northeastern Sri Lanka for the island country's minority Tamils.
They accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against Tamils
in education and jobs.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since
1983.
