	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International denounced the
human rights climate in Cambodia as campaigning for parliamentary
elections drew to a close Friday and urged the international
community to wake up to intimidation and violence against the
opposition.
	   Demelza Stobbings of the London-based human rights group said
that political killings and threats have soared since Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier
in a coup a year ago, but that on an international level ``many
people are not prepared to say what is happening here.''
	   Killings and attacks on members of the opposition have continued
during the one-month election campaign, she said, and human rights
workers are inundated with reports of threats or other forms of
intimidation against those who oppose Hun Sen or his ruling party.
	   ``Activists have been intimidated, politicians have been
threatened, party agents have been shot and killed, and prisoners
have been illegally arrested and badly beaten by policemen while
held in detention,'' Amnesty said in a statement.
	   ``Much of the international community plays down the level of
violence, sanitizes the trauma of victims and ignores the impact of
human rights violence on freedom of association and expression,''
the statement said.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to try to win back legitimacy
and aid lost after his violent takeover, but has been accused by
his critics of rigging the electoral machinery in his favor and
using fear, murder and intimidation to ensure his Cambodian
People's Party wins.
	   Unlike the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, which were
backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Sunday's polls are being organized
by Cambodia. But the U.N. and foreign countries have donated the
bulk of the dlrs 34 million price tag and have sent 678 observers
to assess whether they are credible.
	   The United States, which has called the process fundamentally
flawed, is at odds with other entities, particularly the European
Union, which find the elections the best way of returning a degree
of political stability even if the elections are troubled.
	   Amnesty International blamed ``near silence'' from the
international community for perpetuating the cycle of violence.
