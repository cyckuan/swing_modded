<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Amnesty International's Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Amnesty International's 1996 annual
report on human rights is flawed and one-sided, a statement issued
by Turkey's Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed
to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by
Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's
annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human
rights situation in Turkey in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report fails to take adequate account of changes in Turkey
during 1995 and simply repeats allegations it made in previous
years. It makes no mention of the constitutional and all legal reforms
that Turkey carried out last year in a bid to enhance human
rights, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that Amnesty has again brushed aside the fact that
Turkey has a functioning parliamentary democracy and terrorists
are trying to undermine it by force.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty plays down terrorist violence but exaggerates alleged
abuses by the forces of law and order, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty fails to make it sufficiently clear that
violence can never be a legitimate instrument in the pursuit of
human rights. Indeed, some people reading this report could get
the impression that Amnesty believes violence can be a legitimate
instrument, the statement said.
