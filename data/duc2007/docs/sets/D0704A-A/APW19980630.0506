Amnesty International says war crimes being committed in Kosovo

	   LONDON (AP) _ War crimes are being committed in Kosovo, and each
day greater numbers of civilians are falling victim to
displacement, torture and death, Amnesty International said
Tuesday.
	   The vast majority of victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise
90 percent of the population of the Serbian province, but Serbs are
also suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians
demanding independence, the international human rights organization
said.
	   ``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in
the conflict,'' it said. ``Albanian civilians in particular have
come under artillery, mortar and other weapons fire from the
Yugoslav forces, but the Kosovo Liberation Army has also
deliberately or indiscriminately attacked civilians _ Albanian as
well as Serb.''
	   Clashes between Serbian government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement, have left more than 300 people dead and an unknown number
of others wounded and missing.
	   Some 70,000 people have fled their homes _ about 45,000 to other
parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to neighboring Montenegro, and another
13,000 to northern Albania, Amnesty International said.
	   ``Survivors are fleeing a combination of deliberate or
indiscriminate attacks resulting in many dead and wounded,
arbitrary arrests or abductions, the deliberate destruction of
homes and other gross human rights abuses,'' it said.
	   Amnesty International's Secretary General Pierre Sane told a
news conference that ``war crimes are being committed in Kosovo
today.''
	   ``Only the high level of scrutiny given by the international
media ... has prevented the number of people displaced, missing,
tortured or killed from escalating much farther,'' he said.
	   Sane urged the international community to recognize Kosovo ``as
a human rights crisis ... not simply a threat to regional
security.'' And he said ``only when a comprehensive human rights
agenda is put in place can Kosovo's crisis begin to be resolved.''
	   Earlier this month, the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating
human rights violations in Yugoslavia announced that it was sending
investigators to Kosovo.
	   Paul Miller, an Amnesty International researcher who returned
from Kosovo on Sunday, cited a number of incidents where there may
have been ``grave breaches'' of international law.
	   These included the killing of some 50 Albanians, including women
and children, by excessive Serb force in the village of Prekazin
March; the May 25 shooting of where five ethnic Albanian men in the
village of Ljubinic; and the disappearance of nine men from Poklek
who were taken into custody by Serb forces on May 31.
	   But Miller said it has been difficult to determine who among the
250 ethnic Albanians and 50 Serbs had been unlawfully killed, and
so far no suspected perpetrators of war crimes have been
identified.
