	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge who ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet does
not have immunity from arrest is a director of a charity run by
Amnesty International, the group campaigning for the former Chilean
dictator to face charges of genocide and murder acknowledged
Tuesday, while lobbyists stepped up pressure over Spain's request
for his extradition.
	   Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' Pinochet supporters
demonstrated outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
office, and opponents planned a wreath-laying for victims of his
secret police.
	   ``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen
that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups
in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf
of 700 families urging the government to block extradition of the
83-year-old general and send him home.
	   Controversy over links with Amnesty International of South
African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffman was the latest twist in
the tug-of-war over Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain who was
arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether
extradition proceedings can go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov.
25 by five judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords,
against Pinochet.
	   He is awaiting Straw's decision under police guard in a rented
mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist. But Chile's government wants him back, partly to avoid
exacerbating domestic tensions and threatening the country's newly
built democracy.
	   Amnesty International said Hoffman, 64, an opponent of apartheid
who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990 as the
unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd.
which gets donations for work on human rights.
	   His wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary
in Amnesty International's press office in London.
	   Hoffman and his wife had no involvement in the Pinochet
campaign, said Amnesty International spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
She accused Pincohet supporters of trying to divert attention from
the basic issue of whether he should be tried.
	   ``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights
organizations,'' Ms. Bermejo told the AP.
	   ``In fact when Lord Hoffman was appointed to this case we saw
him as being slightly unpredictable on a human rights,'' she added,
noting that he recently ruled against a man who was sentenced to
death sentence in the Bahamas, a former colony which still allows
appeals to Britain's highest court.
	   In the Pinochet case, the five judges _ in an usual move _
allowed lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.
	   The judges included another native South African, Lord Johan
Steyn, who also ruled against Pinochet.
