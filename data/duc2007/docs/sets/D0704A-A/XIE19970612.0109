NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government last night
criticized Amnesty International (AI) for its "presumptuous"
report "calculated to incite Kenyans against their government".
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here on Wednesday following a 12-day
fact-finding mission in Kenya, the AI accused the government of
violations of human rights and of dragging its feet on legal and
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded rejoinder last evening to the AI
statement, the Kenyan government told the visiting AI
Secretary-General Pierre Sane that it would not tolerate
prescriptions from AI on how to deal with alleged violations of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Kenya reminded AI that it had machinery and a working system
of handling matters such as human rights violations and would
continue to address itself to cases of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The rejoinder said that the AI obsession with the torture and
human rights violations in Kenya were not genuine but were
political in support of opposition political activities.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that some cases of torture and human rights
violations had always been individualized and the government had
already taken actions against the perpetrators of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
"If Amnesty wanted to be fair and objective, it should have
recognized the positive steps that the government has taken to
deal with law enforcement officers who have gone overboard in the
execution of their duties."
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Kenya, the AI delegation claimed that they
interviewed a cross section of Kenyans, among them politicians,
human rights activists, donors and diplomats, and released a
manifesto on human rights situation in Kenya to which Kenyan
Vice-President George Saitoti reacted angrily.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the local newspaper Kenya Times, organ of the
ruling Kenya African National Union, accused AI of having taken
side on Kenya's political affairs, asking "can Amnesty
International be trusted to produce a credible report on the
human rights situation in this country?"
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that "while hundreds of thousands of
innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda, Amnesty International
was busy searching for non-existent 'evidence' of human rights
abuses in peaceful Kenya."
