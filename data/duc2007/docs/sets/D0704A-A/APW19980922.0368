	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The human rights group Amnesty
International on Tuesday called on countries concerned about
Cambodia's political crisis to pressure its government to end
violence and intimidation directed against the opposition.
	   The London-based organization urged the ``Friends of Cambodia''
_ a grouping of foreign governments formed to help restore
stability after a coup d'etat last year _ to use its influence to
ease repressive measures, including a ban on foreign travel by
opposition members of parliament.
	   Foreign ministers from the group are meeting this week at the
U.N. General Assembly session in New York.
	   The appeal came two weeks after the Cambodian government ordered
police to break up street rallies protesting alleged ballot fraud
by strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party during the
July election.
	   At least four protesters were killed and dozens more injured and
arrested during the crackdown. United Nations human rights
investigators have discovered 21 corpses, many with signs of
torture, in its aftermath, prompting speculation that the death
tally could be higher.
	   Amnesty called on the Cambodian authorities to publicly account
for all opposition activists who have been arrested and to release
anyone who has been detained for participating in ``peaceful
political activities.''
	   ``These latest human rights violations are the consequence of
near-total impunity for authorities who abuse their power,
reinforced by the complicit silence of the international
community,'' Amnesty International said in a statement received by
e-mail.
	   Amnesty also urged the opposition, led by Ranariddh and former
finance minister Sam Rainsy, to refrain from using anti-Vietnamese
rhetoric in speeches. As many as five ethnic Vietnamese were
recently killed in Phnom Penh by angry mobs after a poisoning
scare.
	   ``We regret the inflammatory rhetoric that opposition figures
have used against Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese minority, and
condemn recent racist attacks,'' Amnesty said. ``But these do not
excuse a more generalized crackdown on legitimate and peaceful
protest and expressions of public discontent.''
	   The government responded over the weekend to the U.N.'s
discovery of bodies with a report from its own recently-created
``Cambodian Human Rights Committee'' summarizing its investigations
into six bodies found between Sept. 1 and Sept. 18.
	   Suggesting that at least some of the murders were the result of
common crimes, the government reported that one murder appeared to
be the result of an extramarital affair, another was related to a
theft of bananas and that the other four were still under
investigation.
	   Several of the bodies, the government's report noted, were found
with their hands bound behind their backs or shot at close range,
but no link was made to the crackdown on the street demonstrations.
