	   LONDON (AP) _ Amnesty International gave its backing Friday to
Malayasia's jailed former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim,
saying that he was a ``prisoner of conscience.''
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohhamad dismissed Anwar on Sept. 2 and
Anwar was arrested on Sunday. Fourteen of his associates have also
been detained, Amnesty International said.
	   ``Anwar and his associates are prisoners of conscience detained
solely for non-violently calling for political reforms and for
holding different opinions to the prime minister,'' Amnesty
International said.
	   ``By misusing Malaysia's laws to detain political opponents,
Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal
standards on freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and
the treatment of detainees,'' the organization added.
