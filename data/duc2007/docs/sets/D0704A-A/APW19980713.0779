Amnesty International: Rwanda must reinstate U.N. rights mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Amnesty International called on Rwanda
Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in
May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the
country.
	   A delegation representing the U.N. Human Rights Field Operations
in Rwanda arrived in Kigali Sunday for five days of talks with the
government.
	   ``The UN Human Rights Field Operation is one of the very few
international organizations left monitoring and publicly reporting
the human rights situation in Rwanda,'' said London-based Amnesty
International.
	   ``It would be disastrous if the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights now agrees to remove or dilute this essential part of the
operation's mandate.''
	   The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission
because of lack of coordination.
	   The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up
following the 1994 genocide, was due for review. Rwanda wants the
mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its
efforts to educating people about human rights.
	   The Amnesty statement said the Rwandan government has set a
deadline of July 27 for reaching agreement on the mission's
mandate, otherwise it will close down the operation.
	   ``The human rights situation in Rwanda is critical,'' the
Amnesty statement said. ``We receive almost daily reports about
killings and `disappearances,' and the UNHRFOR is indispensable for
investigating and documenting these cases on the ground.''
	   Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after
Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had
sponsored the genocide.
	   The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus dead.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled
among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only
in Nov. 1996.
	   Amnesty and the U.N. human rights agency have reported that
thousands of people have since been killed in attacks by Hutu
rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi military.
