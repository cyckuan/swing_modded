Amnesty International says Brazilian activist was unfairly tried

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A leader of Brazil's landless
movement, sentenced to 26 years for his part in two killings, did
not receive a fair trial, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
	   The human rights group called for an impartial retrial of Jose
Rainha Jr., one of the leaders of the Landless Rural Workers
Movement and said he was a potential prisoner of conscience, in a
report that was to be issued Wednesday.
	   Amnesty International uses the term ``prisoner of conscience,''
for people punished for their ideals rather than for criminal acts.
	   Rainha was found guilty last November of participating in the
1989 killings of a farmer and police officer that occurred when
movement members stormed a farm in Pedro Canario 370 miles (600
kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. He was sentenced to 26 years in
prison.
	   The landless movement promotes the takeover of land it considers
unproductive as a way to pressure the government into speeding up
its agrarian reform program.
	   Amnesty Internation's report was to call for stepped-up pressure
up against police violence and maintains that human rights
violations continue against Indians and the landless, Fiona
Macaulay, the organization's Brazilian researcher, said by
telephone from London.
	   The report, however, praised the government for creating a
National Human Rights Secretary. It also backed moves to protect
crime witnesses and reform the country's police and criminal
justice system.
	   Rainha remains free pending a retrial, which Brazilian law
grants anyone sentenced to more than 20 years for a single crime.
Rainha is due to be retried later this year in Vitoria, the capital
of Espirito Santo, a move that Amnesty International has backed.
	   Amnesty International has said in the past that there is
``compelling evidence'' that Rainha was falsely convicted of the
killings.
	   At the first trial, defense lawyers argued that 14 members of
the 21-member jury pool had links with local farmers, and three
were related to one of the shooting victims.
	   ``His trial did not meet international standards of
impartiality. If he is jailed under the same circumstances at his
retrial we will consider him a prisoner of conscience,'' Macaulay
said Tuesday.
