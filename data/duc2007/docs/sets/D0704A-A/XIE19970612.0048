<HEADLINE> Moi Accuses Amnesty of Applying Double Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has accused Amnesty International of applying double standard in
the assessment of human rights violation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on Wednesday at both the Kenyan International
Conference Center and the Kenya Science Teachers College during a
workshop of the stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The president wondered why government officers serving in the
police force were never regarded as victims of human rights
violation whenever they were murdered or injured during their
course of duty.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Head of State pointed out that Amnesty
International treated police officers as if they were not part of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
He wondered what standards were used to define human rights in
Africa as children carried guns in certain countries while mass
killings occurred in others yet no human rights action appear to
deter the trend.
</P>
<P>
President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was
far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International
were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more
serious in its work.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane,
Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them
on how to conduct their affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day
fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government
of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in response to the manefesto and press release
issued by Amnesty International, the Kenyan government said that
all allegations by the organization were calculated to incite
Kenyans against their government.
