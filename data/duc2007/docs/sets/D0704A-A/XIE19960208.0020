<HEADLINE> Amnesty International Warns Israel against Interrogation Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Amnesty International Pierre Sane warned today that Israel will
set a sinister precedent if it legalizes forms of torture against
Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Sane issued the warning during a meeting with Israeli Justice
Minister David Liba'i here, urging Israel to stop such legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Sane criticized
Israel's continued use of torture and other inhumane methods
in interrogating Palestinian detainees suspected of being
involved in violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the first visit ever by head of Amnesty International to
Israel in nine years, Sane said that he has come to the region to
ensure that human rights guarantees be respected by both Israel
and the Palestinians as the peace process advances.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that both Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) ban policies that violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
Israel must ban the use of torture against all the
detainees and revise open-fire guidelines established by the
military, he said, adding that administrative detention must
also be stopped and the Israeli authorities must ensure that the
trials are fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sane demanded that the PNA halt methods of torture
and put an end to arbitrary political arrests in the autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he made a request that the PNA stop unfair trials
and abolish death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sane and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with PNA President Yasser Arafat and four
Palestinian Council members in the Gaza Strip Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sane warned that human rights can not be
ignored in the rush to attain peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was concerned that human rights issues
are being pushed aside in favor of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the priorities of the various parties,
their priority is peace, not human rights," he said.
