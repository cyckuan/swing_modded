<HEADLINE> Amnesty International Accuses German Police of Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The human rights watchdog Amnesty
International accused German police of racism in a report issued
here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Butler, Amnesty's investigator responsible
for Germany, evidence collected since 1995, which listed 40 cases
involving police violence against non-Germans or German nationals
of foreign extraction, showed that police racism was part of a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
Butler also accused prosecutors of being dilatory over claims
of police violence and the courts of being partial to police in
dealing with such cases.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent
complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such
complaints.
</P>
<P>
The Amnesty report was immediately challenged by the interior
ministers of Germany's 16 states, who denied the police were
racist as a whole and noted that the misdeeds of individual
policemen were objectively and thoroughly investigated by
prosecutors and the courts.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, every state has its own police force.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International also complained of similar police
violence in Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Austria and
Switzerland.
