   When the federal government held its first summit meeting on
nutrition 31 years ago, the principal food problem was hunger, and
the proposed solutions were improvements in food stamps and the
establishment of the WIC program for infants, children, and
pregnant women. This week, the second national nutrition summit
found a twofold problem: hunger and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Combating the latter is complex, and Washington is doing less
than it could to improve American diets.
</P>
<P>
   In three decades, much progress has been made in getting food to
those who need it. Still, a combination of high housing costs, the
unevenness of the economic boom's benefits, and restrictions on
food stamps and other programs forces many Americans to ask for
help in finding their daily bread. In a survey of mayors last year,
85 percent reported that requests for emergency food assistance had
grown, by an average of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nation's other great nutrition problem is
obesity, now reaching epidemic proportions. One fifth of all
Americans are obese, raising their risk of heart disease, stroke,
and diabetes. Several sessions of this week's summit explore how
schools, employers, restaurants, and the media can change the
patterns of eating and inactivity that lead to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The summit took place just days after the government updated its
dietary guidelines, as it does every five years, and for the first
time specifically recommended exercise to help avoid obesity.
</P>
<P>
   But the government caved in to the sugar industry by rejecting
language favored by its own panel of scientists calling on
consumers to ``limit'' sugar intake. Instead, the guidelines say
Americans should ``moderate'' their sugar consumption. The wording
change followed a massive lobbying effort by the sugar processing
industry, which has contributed $1.2 million to senators since
1995. In March, 30 senators signed a letter making the
extraordinary argument that there is no proven link between sugar
and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Government was a public health leader in pointing to the obvious
relationship between cigarettes and cancer, when the tobacco
industry was raising bogus questions about scientific proof. Now,
government can't seem to connect a candy bar with an unhealthy
paunch.
