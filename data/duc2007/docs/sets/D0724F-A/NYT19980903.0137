   UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,''
and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half
of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
</P>
<P>
   The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into
obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings
linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including
heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine
public health threat,'' said University of Colorado obesity
researcher James O. Hill in the May issue of the journal
``Science.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's still a
medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are answers.
</P>
<P>
   What is known: Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of
environmental and genetic factors. Up until 20 years ago, obesity
was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony
and a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary
factor in most cases of obesity. But geneticists now are
recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the
area of obesity and genetics. For the past 30 years, the Gila River
Pimas have agreed to participate in generational studies on
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pimas, as a group, have an unusually high incidence of
obesity, which also has contributed to their highest recorded rates
of diabetes in the world. A Gila River Pima man has an 80 percent
chance of becoming diabetic before he's 55, according to Dr. David
Harrowe, a public health officer for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity researcher Dr. Eric Ravussin, formerly with the National
Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area, has studied the Pimas,
and was the focus of the February '98 ``New Yorker'' magazine
article ``The Pima Paradox.'' He believes the Pimas' plight is tied
closely to their genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As desert dwellers, the Pima evolved ``thrifty'' fat genes as
a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of
famine,'' Ravussin said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods
of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary
beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check
during normal times.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to
eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other
Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability. Their new
higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to
Ravussin.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of
pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not
exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, obviously, in every population there are people who have
more thrifty genes than other people,'' Brilliant said. ``If that
wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the
same weight.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to
hormonal irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity specialist Dr. Donald Robertson of the Southwest
Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz., said the consensus
among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine
organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called
leptin,'' Robertson said. ``Understanding how leptin works seems to
be a key in treating obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop
eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.
However, this signal does not get through properly in some
overweight people. Consequently, scientists have tried to inject
synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation
response.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone
leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Endocrinologist Dr. Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in
Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas
and obesity. His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that
obesity has a physiological basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that obesity is a
disease,'' Tataranni said. ``It's a matter of understanding how
hormones stimulate different areas of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected. A
London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   People who are overweight often say they don't understand their
weight gain because they ``practically eat nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically
underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the
high caloric, fatty foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,'' said
head researcher Dr. Berit Heitmann.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial
further impedes chances for weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate
factors have in the overall obesity package. But Harrowe, the Pima
public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control
does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want is people developing this attitude that
there's nothing they can do about it anyway,'' Harrowe said. ``You
have to focus on lifestyle changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat
epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that
places inordinate emphasis on quantity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming obese is a normal response to the American
environment,'' said obesity researcher Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit
at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for
fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food
available; social and work situations encourage overeating;
restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings;
64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce
bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health,
agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the
pathoenvironment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so
drastically, they would not be in their current condition,''
Ravussin said. ``But the same can be said for non-Pimas. Getting
food was hard work until 100 years ago. Now, it's available in
abundance without any activity required to obtain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said
he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity
and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the
largest soft drink under a buck. He said he'd also like restaurants
to be more responsible in the portions they serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a
normal meal and you get enough for three people,'' Robertson said.
``It's obscene. My wife and I now routinely order one entree and
split it.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out
of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts
weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers
believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and
exercise anyway. &QL;

 &QL; 
Are you obese? &QL; 
Obesity is defined clinically as being 20 percent heavier than your
ideal weight. &QL; 
Overwhelming research shows that the risks of heart disease, high
blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis and even some
forms of cancer start to climb when body-fat levels are above a
rating of 24 BMI (body mass index), but really soar above a BMI of
30. &QL; 
A rating of 25 is overweight; 30 obese; 40 severely obese. &QL; 
To calculate your own approximate body mass index: &QL; 
- Multiply your weight by 700. &QL; 
- Divide the answer by your height in inches. &QL; 
- Divide again by height in inches. &QL; 
It should be noted that these new government guidelines do not take
all factors into consideration, especially muscle weight, which is
heavier and generally more healthful than fat weight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
By the numbers &QL; 
- Fifty-four percent of all American adults are heavier than is
healthy, according to a recent study from the University of
Colorado. About one-third of American adults are obese, which is
defined as being 20 percent over your ideal weight. Twenty-five
percent of people under the age of 18 are considered obese also. &QL; 
- Instances of severe obesity _ not being able to fit in an airline
seat _ have ballooned 350 percent over the past 30 years. &QL; 
- The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the
second-leading cause (after smoking) of preventable death in the
United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease
costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care
expenses or in lost productivity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Slim-down plan &QL; 
Recommendations by obesity specialists for thinning up America: &QL; 
- Encourage physical exercise, perhaps even reward people with
reduced insurance premiums or additional vacation time. &QL; 
- Encourage restaurants not to use food portions as a competitive
issue. People generally will eat all that they are served. &QL; 
- Increase the sense of urgency about controlling obesity among the
public and health-care workers through government-sponsored
campaigns similar to the ones for anti-smoking. &QL; 
- Require schoolchildren to exercise vigorously at least 30 minutes
daily. &QL; 
- ncrease the availability of low-fat foods such as fruits,
vegetables and whole grains, and make processed low-fat foods as
tasty as high-fat versions. &QL;
