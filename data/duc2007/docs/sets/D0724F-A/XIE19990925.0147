<HEADLINE> Study Shows Obesity Rates Soar in California </HEADLINE>

LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A new study released
Friday shows that most California residents are choosing fast-food
over more nutritious choices -- and are paying for it with soaring
rates of obesity.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics accumulated by the California
Department of Health Services, nearly half of Californians who ate
out on an average day chose a fast-food restaurant, up from one-
third in 1989. And the number of Californians who are overweight
or obese jumped 50 percent between 1984 and 1997. What's more,
the rate of diabetes rose 25 percent during the same period.

<P>
Obesity is a known risk factor for adult-onset diabetes, heart
disease, and some types of cancer.

"In California, it's expected that approximately 35,000 people
will die this year from illnesses related to poor diet and
physical inactivity," Dr. James W. Stratton, a state health
officer, predicted
</P>
<P>
Most Californians polled blame aggressive television
advertising for their poor food choices, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The new study is based on two surveys. Dietary habits were
assessed by telephone surveys conducted every other year starting
in 1989, while information on weight and physical activity came
from a separate yearly report conducted every year since 1984.
