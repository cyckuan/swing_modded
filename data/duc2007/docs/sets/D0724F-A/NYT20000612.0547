&HT;     AMERICANS GROW FATTER, EXPERTS DEBATE BEST RESPONSE

   TROY, N.Y. _ Americans are getting fatter and health specialists
are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make it a priority in our culture to eat well,'' said
Anne Rogan, a professor of nutrition at the Sage Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why the number of overweight adult Americans
continues to grow. Today, more than half of all Americans are
considered too heavy, up from about 25 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Those alarming statistics set the stage two weeks ago for the
first Nutrition Summit in 31 years and the release of new federal
dietary guidelines. While no one is expecting any overnight
miracles, the goal is to focus attention on the problem of obesity
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the first nutrition summit, in 1969, was aimed at
reducing hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scales aren't lying. ... We have a serious weight
problem,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said
at the opening of this year's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about expanding waistlines is also at the heart of new
dietary guidelines published in May. Revised every five years, the
guidelines are meant to incorporate the latest advances in medical
and scientific research while giving the country a dietary
blueprint to follow.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the ``Food Guide Pyramid'' is the most
recognizable symbol of those guidelines, spelling out the
recommended number of daily servings of vegetables, dairy, grains,
meat and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the guidelines emphasize physical activity,
recommending at least 30 minutes of daily exercise for adults and
60 minutes for children.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie DiBacco, the assistant director of patient services at
the Albany Medical Center, especially likes those specific
suggestions, as well as new language in the guidelines about the
importance of eating whole grains, such as oatmeal, barley or brown
rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a far greater attempt this time to support whole
grains, fruits and vegetables,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet DiBacco, like most nutrition experts, is realistic. She
knows most people don't consult the guidelines before opening the
refrigerator door, especially those recommendations that call for
moderation in portion size and sugar intake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderation is such an ugly word for Americans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is happy with the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really aren't strong enough,'' said Patricia R. Bertron,
a New Jersey registered dietitian and a consultant with the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group
based in Washington that emphasizes preventive medicine and good
nutrition. ``Americans, as a whole, are in the worst shape they've
ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The group takes exception to the recommended daily servings of
dairy and meat. ``They're the primary sources of saturated fat and
cholesterol in the diet,'' she said. ``They really should be
pushing the health benefits of a plant-based diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although PCRM encourages a vegetarian diet, not everyone has to
make such a drastic change to reap the health benefits of eating
more grains, legumes and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to do that is to think of the 10 meals you make
most often in your home. Bertron proposes making at least three of
those meals vegetarian. For example, if you eat spaghetti with meat
sauce, make it just spaghetti with tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looking at three meals you can change, she also suggests
coming up with three new vegetarian recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, guidelines are only guidelines, and the daily
decision of what and how much to eat is an individual choice. If
anything, nutritionists hope people will think about those
decisions before a health problem, like heart disease or obesity,
comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have to hear the message over and over again,''
DiBacco said.
