	   BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists have discovered another genetic flaw
that seems to raise the risk of obesity.
	   Several genetic defects have already been found that increase
the tendency to put on weight. None of them, acting alone, appears
to be a frequent cause of obesity.
	   The latest was discovered by Dr. Michael Ristow and others from
the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. It was reported in Thursday's
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
	   The defective gene produces the protein for
peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2. It is involved
in one of the steps in the production of fat cells.
	   The researchers, working with scientists in Cologne, Germany,
looked for the defective gene in 358 German volunteers, 121 of whom
were overweight. Four of the obese people carried the mutated gene,
but none of the normal-size people had it.
	   The researchers concluded that the bad gene increases growth in
fat cells and contributes to obesity in some people.
