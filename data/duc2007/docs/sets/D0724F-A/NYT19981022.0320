FATTENING OF AMERICA: 55% NOW OVERWEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   _ The United States is now the fattest
nation on earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And if we keep on eating the way we do now, by 2030 everyone in
America will be obese.
</P>
<P>
   The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it
demands urgent attention by medical professionals, the government
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message repeated again and again this week by
experts at the American Dietetic Association's annual meeting in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   They came armed with statistics and a missionary zeal to enlist
dietitians as front-line fighters in the war against obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the fattest we've ever been,'' said Sachiko Tokunaga de
St. Jeor, director of the nutrition research and education program
at the University of Nevada. ``Obesity is the No. 1 malnutrition
problem in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese
has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55
percent today. The average man now weighs 25 pounds more than men
of his great-grandfather's generation.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture
of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast
food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with
advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables
we eat are french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American, particularly children, recognizes
`supersize' as a verb,'' said Yale University psychologist Kelly
Brownell, referring to the term for ordering larger portions of
french fries at McDonald's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects of obesity have been staggering. The
condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United
States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases
and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to
figures cited at the meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of treating obesity-related diseases adds up to $52
billion per year, according to estimates cited by the National
Institutes of Health. When indirect costs of obesity, such as lost
productivity, are added in, the sum approaches $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the past many doctors did not consider obesity a medical
problem and left its treatment to fad diet promoters, said Louis
Aronne, clinical professor of medicine at Cornell University
Medical College. He was one of the speakers at the Dietetic
Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency
of the epidemic have changed their perspective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in June the American Heart Association put obesity
alongside smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and
sedentary lifestyle on its list of major modifiable risk factors
for heart attack and coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity treatment ``has been on the fringe on the infomercials;
now it's moving into prime time,'' Aronne said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of diet drugs are being developed so that one day doctors
will be ``capable of controlling body weight completely,'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Until that time, however, doctors and their patients will have
to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard
bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss,
experts said.  &LR; brk:No quick cure  &LR; tx:Obesity is a chronic disease
that requires regular medical treatment and a lifelong commitment
by patients to control their weight. People who quickly lose large
amounts of weight typically gain it all back in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all tried to get (obese patients) down to skinny little
people, and that's impossible,'' said John Foreyt, a psychologist
at Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep patient expectations realistic....None of us is in the
business of cosmetics. We're in the business of helping patients
improve their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing 10 percent of one's weight is a realistic initial goal,
said F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the obesity research center
at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But even dropping five or 10 pounds can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small and achievable weight loss can have a major impact on
health risks,'' said Pi-Sunyer.
</P>
<P>
   Pi-Sunyer was chairman of a federal panel of experts that issued
guidelines in June on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the panel, people are considered overweight if
their body mass indexes, a comparison of weight to height, are 25
or over. Anyone with an index of 30 or higher is considered obese.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 164
pounds has an index of 25. If that person weighs 197 pounds, the
index is 30.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that moderately overweight people should
at least try to stabilize their weight. If they have other medical
conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, they should
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   For obese people, the report said, weight loss is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 20 and 60, we gain an average of half a
pound per year. But being overweight is afflicting people of all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of overweight children have a medical complication
such as elevated cholesterol, triglycerides or insulin levels, a
new study shows, said William Dietz of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Children have been losing opportunities for physical activity
because their parents are less likely to let them walk to school,
and schools are less likely to emphasize physical education, Dietz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The more television children watch, the more likely they are to
be obese, Dietz said. And the TV-obesity relationship has grown
stronger in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly also are joining the ranks of the obese in greater
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When many people think of elderly persons, they think of tiny,
frail people,'' said Gordon Jensen, associate professor of medicine
at Vanderbilt University. ``They're actually frail, big people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen is conducting research on more than 12,500 elderly
residents of rural Pennsylvania, about one third of whom are obese.
He has found that as their weight goes up, so does the likelihood
that the person has trouble walking or climbing stairs, or even
getting into and out of a car.
</P>
<P>
   These elderly, he said, ``are often trapped in their homes,
can't bathe themselves, can't dress themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   People who are obese in old age tended to be overweight and
sedentary in middle age as well and continued gaining weight into
their 50s and 60s, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess who's right behind them? The baby boomers. We're going
to be looking at greater and greater numbers of obese elderly
people,'' Jensen said. ``Vast numbers of older persons are going to
suffer the consequences of obesity.''  &LR; brk:Often overlooked
 &LR; tx:Just as the overweight often face social discrimination, they
also are slighted by government and by private health plans when
they seek medical help for their condition, said Judith Stern, a
nutrition professor at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health spends $100 million per year
on obesity research, she said. But that amount is dwarfed by the $1
billion spent on cardiovascular disease research and the $2 billion
spent on cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies often will not cover obesity treatment, she
said. In many cases doctors helping a patient lose weight may have
to seek reimbursement by treating the patient's obesity-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare and Medicaid do not cover obesity treatment, Stern
said. The armed services do not offer treatment for obesity, but
the condition can lead to a less-than-honorable discharge, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity treatment is one of just two categories of medical care
the Internal Revenue Service has ruled ineligible for tax
deductions, Stern said. The other category is cosmetic plastic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But however much medical treatment becomes available to
individual patients, it won't stop the obesity epidemic, Brownell
of Yale said. To do that, there must be social action to change the
country's ``toxic food environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This environment has been created by a food industry that
encourages people to eat too much of the wrong foods, Brownell
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fast food is being offered in school lunchrooms,
Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we do anything worse in our schools? This is second only
to having cigarette machines in our schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownell proposed changing America's eating habits by levying a
tax on junk food and offering fruit and vegetables at a government
subsidized discount.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for regulating food advertising, particularly to
children, the same way tobacco advertising is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think children should be exposed to Ronald McDonald
any more than to Joe Camel,'' he said.
