<HEADLINE> Obesity Is Soaring in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans are getting fatter, and the South --  
where meals are often finger-lickin' good and steamy summers lead 
to days of lounging inside -- is leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese -- 
defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight 
-- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that  
time frame. Georgia led the nation with a 101.8 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	While traditional Southern cooking -- fried chicken, potato  
salad, barbecue -- is often high in fat, experts say Southerners' 
diets are now not much different from those in the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The more likely reason for the increase in portliness below the  
Mason-Dixon line is a lack of exercise. Southerners are less likely 
to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a health club than their 
counterparts in the rest of the nation, according to Georgia's 
Division of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest obesity rates were in New England and in the West,  
where people are more active. Even there, though, obesity rates are 
on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot for  
people to get outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,''  
said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness 
center. ``They go in and find air conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, including Dr. William Dietz, one of the study's  
co-authors, blame the design of modern suburbs. Dietz points out 
that the sprawl around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars 
for hours, encourages them to eat greasy fast food and prevents 
them from having enough time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The period measured in the study coincides with a time of rapid  
population growth around Atlanta. In 1991, Georgia had one of the 
lowest obesity rates in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atlanta is not a walkable community,'' said Pam Wilson, a  
dietitian with Georgia's division of public health. ``We don't have 
sidewalks that lead anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC study, announced Tuesday at the AMA's annual Science  
Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 
100,000 participants each year between 1991 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics  
showed the most drastic increases. But the study found ``a steady 
increase'' in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races 
and educational levels; and regardless of smoking status. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United  
States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, 
according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was to be published in Wednesday's Journal of the  
American Medical Association, along with other studies on obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said a national strategy is  
needed to combat obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, restoring physical activity to our daily routines  
is critical,'' he said.
