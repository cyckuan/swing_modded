<P>
   It certainly is easy to get fat in America. Take the room
service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md. If you
order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels,
orange juice, a banana and strawberries _ a meal with at least
1,000 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of
the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average
number of calories year by year. And the percentage of adults who
claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991
to 1998, at about 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a
predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year. More
than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more
than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official
medical measure of fatness. (Overweight is defined as a body mass
index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30. Your body mass
index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of
your height in feet.)
</P>
<P>
   And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with
poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed
to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose
fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust. In a preliminary
study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little
or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually
gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future
could hold more bad news. Others say there may in fact be a magic
bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular
biology. And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective
obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that
has proved so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an
obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating. Every time it
seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more
weight. These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population
gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors
to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise. It also called for
a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths. If the nation can
mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for
obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity
prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and
environmental components analogous to those already in place for
tobacco use,'' the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a
new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat
people lose interest in eating to excess. Perhaps the drugs should
be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some
researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat
people who cannot control their weight.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of
leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as
part of a natural weight control system. As such, it has revealed
molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely
targeted weight loss drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my prediction,'' said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, who is
deputy director of the obesity research center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent
leptin study. ``We are going to be able to turn off appetite
completely _ eventually. The therapeutics will be sophisticated
enough to stop people from eating.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while there are certainly social and environmental
influences on body weight _ people who live in Southern states tend
to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter _ eventually obesity
will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels. Those who
cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a
pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this
lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of
willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people
were overweight,'' Heymsfield said. ``Seven or eight years ago, the
first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very
important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one
or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People
were shocked.'' That discovery came when scientists reported that
leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin. The
next year, the hormone was found in people.
</P>
<P>
   At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to
be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat
people and they will get thin. But it turned out that overweight
people make plenty of leptin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a
half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
These people eat voraciously _ one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000
calories at a sitting. When several of these people were treated
with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal
the brain that there is fat on the body.
