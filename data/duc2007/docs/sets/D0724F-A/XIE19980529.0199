LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than half of American
citizens are overweight and one out of four is obese, according to
the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence of overweight has risen dramatically over the
past two decades and, if this trend persists, the entire
U.S. adult population could be overweight within a few
generations," reported Dr. James Hill, director of the Colorado
Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, and Dr. John Peters of the
Procter and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
They said the root cause is a sedentary lifestyle combined with
the ready availability of tasty, calorie-and-fat-rich food. "This
is especially evident in the so-called fast food restaurants where
super sizing of menu items is commonplace," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that genetic factors are not to blame for
oversized Americans, saying that genes can not have changed
substantially in the last two generations.
</P>
<P>
They offered several options to prevent obesity.
</P>
<P>
First, obesity must be recognized as the serious public health
problem.
</P>
<P>
Second, consumers must be educated to eat foods low in fat,
such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains in restaurants and
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
Third, schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters,
and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat
foods too.
