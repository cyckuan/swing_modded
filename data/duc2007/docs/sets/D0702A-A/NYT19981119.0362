A VILLAGE WITH MUSIC IN THE FAMILY TAKES IT TO THE CLASSROOM

<P>
   While many public schools, struggling under budget constraints
and competing academic interests, are marginalizing arts programs,
if not eliminating them altogether, the opposite is happening in
the small village of Greenport at the tip of the North Fork on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, under the leadership of David Kapell, the mayor
of Greenport since 1994, a new program will bring classical music
to the 600 students in the town's single public school. Kapell's
support for classical music comes not just from his belief in the
value of the arts but also from his personal history. He is the son
of the pianist William Kapell, who died in a plane crash in 1953
when he was just 31 and at the peak of acclaim. At the time, David
Kapell was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kapell's mission has been aided by another Greenport resident,
John Serkin, also the son of a famous pianist. Serkin, the third of
Rudolf Serkin's six children and a onetime French horn player, is
now a piano technician and tuner and serves on the village's Arts
and Culture Committee. He was instrumental in working out the
details of the new arts program, which will bring students from the
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to classrooms in
Greenport, where they will discuss and perform music. Rudolf
Serkin, who died in 1991, was a longtime director of the Curtis
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for the program, Serkin has solicited the help of
his younger brother, the pianist Peter Serkin, who is to play a
benefit recital on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Greenport School
Auditorium. Serkin will perform on a grand piano provided by
Steinway &AMP; Sons in Manhattan. With this gesture, the company is
both supporting the educational initiative and honoring the memory
of two major pianists who were exclusive Steinway artists.
</P>
<P>
   The piano, valued at $50,000, is essentially being lent to the
school, though the term the company prefers is ``long-term
placement.'' It will be moved to the auditorium for Serkin's
recital but will be kept permanently in a new wing of the village's
Floyd Memorial Library, where the Curtis students will present
concerts in conjunction with their work in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't be more grateful,'' Kapell said recently, speaking
of the contributions from the Steinway company and Peter Serkin.
``The arts program in Greenport has been minimal, if anything. Our
kids were missing cultural expansion, which is a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefit recital should generate enough money to support the
music program for a full three years, John Serkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has two goals: nurturing aspiring musicians and
developing appreciation and audiences for the arts. The response,
Kapell said, is ``really surprising'' and ``very encouraging.'' The
hall, which seats more than 700, is sold out for Sunday's concert,
and the waiting list for tickets is approaching 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelmingly local people who are coming, people who
live within 10 miles of the village,'' Kapell said.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to benefactors who contributed $500 each, at least
150 seats will be occupied free by students from nearby school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor described Greenport as a ``true blue-collar town,
fundamentally,'' though this ``belies the broader demographics'' of
the area and its small, stable and diverse economy. Local
industries include fishing, wineries, retail and tourism. While the
population of the incorporated village is 2,100, the school serves
a district of 5,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   John Serkin has been tuning the piano and voicing it (adjusting
the density of the felt hammerheads for sound quality) in
preparation for his brother's recital.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the works he will play, Peter Serkin has devised a
substantive and varied program, including shorter pieces by Chopin,
Debussy and Messiaen; recent works by Gyorgy Kurtag and George
Benjamin; Schoenberg's Piano Suite, Op. 25 (a challenging 12-tone
work that Serkin plays vibrantly), and, in the second half,
Mozart's Sonata K. 332 and Beethoven's ``Les Adieu'' Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait,'' the mayor said. ``The students are excited.
You never know where the next great musician is going to come from.
It could be Greenport.''
