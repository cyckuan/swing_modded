   LOS ANGELES _ Merchant Street is a tattered row of produce
warehouses and auto body shops, its littered sidewalks and cracked
street home to the poor and to drug addicts. This is not a pretty
part of town, but here in the heart of what is known as skid row is
a jewel.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of an asphalt parking lot, in a wall decorated with
dancing colored letters, a door gives a view into a charming urban
courtyard. A cheerful ceramic fountain amid ripening orange trees
and palm trees is covered in hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers
and birds. Youngsters often clean their paintbrushes under the
spray. Running almost the length of the courtyard is the glass
front facade of a large, bow-trussed building. On any given day, a
circle of children sits inside, absorbed in painting
self-portraits.
</P>
<P>
   This is Inner City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an
enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where
education is embellished by architectural example. Inner City Arts,
founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and
English language instruction to students from public elementary
schools _ largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and
Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The school was founded by Bob Bates, an artist and teacher, and
Irwin Jaeger, a Beverly Hills real estate investor who decided
there had to be more to life, as he put it, ``than working, taking
vacations and going to charity dinners.'' Their aim was to fill a
void in arts education created by Proposition 13, a property tax
cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California
voters that slashed financing for public services and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following the passage, said Beth Tishler, the
school's executive director, virtually ``all arts curriculum was
eliminated from the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 200 nonprofit arts programs in Los
Angeles, many considered excellent, but Inner City Arts is rare in
that it boasts, in its converted 8,000-square-foot auto body shop,
an inspiring home, where the architecture elevates the social and
arts-education experiences. The building, officially called the
Mark Taper Center/Inner City Arts, was designed by Michael Maltzan
Architecture, in collaboration with Marmol &AMP; Radziner Architecture
and Construction.
</P>
<P>
   Maltzan, a protege of Frank Gehry and the project architect on
the Disney Concert Hall planned for downtown Los Angeles, said that
he felt compelled ``to do something'' after the city's 1992 riots
and that he did the work pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was my adopted city,'' he said. ``To see it rip itself
apart was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   At the school, what the architects accomplished is a building
that is expansive, airy _ with light pouring in through its vast
window wall _ and bold in its sculptural forms. The plan, described
by Maltzan as ``a village of objects'' around a central courtyard,
affords views from one area to another _ ``limitless horizons,''
Maltzan says _ as well as flexibility: spaces are constantly used
in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The design is also an object lesson in construction. Children
study the raw surfaces _ the unadorned brick walls, the timber
frame partly clad in plasterboard, the exposed trusses, the
industrial roll-up garage doors. They draw inspiration for their
own drawings and paintings from the strong, simple shapes. ``Kids
use the building as material for some of their art projects,'' Ms.
Tishler said. ``They talk about how the building was put together,
the ways in which they contribute to the changing and molding of
the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children live in lamentable conditions in apartments for
transients or in housing projects. ``I love it _ it's big''; ``it's
fun''; ``it has pictures all around,'' were some reactions of a
group of 7-year-olds on a recent visit. Nick Estrada, 18, a former
pupil and now a volunteer there, said, ``Inner City Arts is my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City
Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools
who attend classes twice a week for six weeks. More schools are
clamoring to be included. In 1994, the school moved from two
temporary bungalows to its current premises, at 720 South Kohler
Street (one entrance is off Merchant Street). It has bought two
adjacent industrial buildings and intends to triple in size, with
plans that include animation studios.
</P>
<P>
   The school _ now backed by an impressive list of donors, like
the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mark Taper Foundation,
which supports, among other things, social services and the arts _
has a unique relationship with the Los Angeles Unified School
District. The district provides transportation and security and has
helped the school create a program for teaching English through
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This private-public partnership is a national model,'' said
Leticia Quezada, a past president of the Los Angeles Board of
Education. ``The quality of the arts experience the children are
receiving is phenomenal, 400 percent better than it would be in the
school classroom. There's a sense of confidence in the arts
experience those children are getting, and we want to see it
extended to other schools.''
