EDUCATION COLUMN: EMPHASIS ON SCORES COMES AT A PRICE

   There is a national consensus that students need more competency
in reading, math, science and history. But Americans also want
schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.
When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do
they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
</P>
<P>
   When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers
inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills. Less easily
tested ones get shorter shrift. For example, it is simpler to test
vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may
dilute literacy, not enhance it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic
competencies. The public once trusted teachers and administrators
to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and
other activities. They may not always have gotten it right, but
today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good
balance either. If basic skills were undervalued before, they are
probably overemphasized now.
</P>
<P>
   Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives. Teachers
must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop
citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.
Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to
schedule the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas. Consider the
Academy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly
poor and minority students. It may be closed if scores do not
improve, so it now requires extra drills in basics. To find time,
teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth. It
has doubled math and English requirements for half its
ninth-graders because they cannot graduate without passing state
exams. To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an
elective, like fine arts or gym.
</P>
<P>
   And in the affluent Washington suburb of Waterford, Va., an
elementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans
for environmental studies because these cannot increase passing
rates on statewide exams.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the current math and science focus is working. More
high schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and
physics. Test scores are rising. But more teenagers have fatty
diets; physical education enrollment has plummeted. Adolescent
obesity has soared. Neither children nor our economy will prosper
if graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor
exercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior. Should
Charlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education
instead?
</P>
<P>
   Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills. But
pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative,
project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on
standardized exams.
</P>
<P>
   People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation,
not violence. But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly
accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do
more. A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public
wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take
responsibility.'' Only 39 percent say it should be academics. The
rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first''
in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth
for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community
service), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having
them ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps
Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if
that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.
Perhaps not. The public cannot debate these choices if schools are
accountable only for basic skills results.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests have improved many American schools.
Nonetheless, society pays a price for this progress. If Americans
do not equally demand accountability for less easily measured
outcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public
education.
