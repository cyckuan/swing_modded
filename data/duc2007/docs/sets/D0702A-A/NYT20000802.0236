   Never mind that Mozart's concertos strike peaceful chords in
music lovers. In academia, the battle lines are drawn, and the next
salvo in the Mozart wars is about to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are mustering data to counter those who are intent
on debunking the ``Mozart effect'' _ the theory that classical
music makes the brain work better _ and they have some high-profile
allies. President Clinton and the musician Billy Joel, for example,
spoke in June at a school in New York City's East Harlem that
received a donation of $5 million in musical instruments from VH1
Save the Music Foundation, in support of the notion that musical
education can provide a powerful intellectual stimulus.

   In May, Harold O. Levy, the chancellor of New York City's public
schools, surprised 43 school superintendents by arranging for them
to take a group violin lesson from Isaac Stern.

   Music educators have long claimed that music, one of
civilization's great gifts, bestows a bouquet of benefits upon
children. They say that music sharpens children's concentration and
makes them brighter and livelier.
</P>
<P>
   If music's beauty and mystery fail to impress cost-conscious
school boards, the thinking goes, then proving its ancillary
benefits might save music programs from the budgetary ax wielded by
those who regard music as an expensive luxury unrelated to reading,
writing and `rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   To help determine who is right, an array of scientists is
studying how music works in the brain. The researchers have
analyzed babies' responses to lullabies, as well as their awareness
of pitch and rhythm, showing, in some studies, that infants
experience music much as adults do. We arrive ready to join the
band, the scientists say, but too often the instruments have been
packed away by schools that no longer use them.
</P>
<P>
   A report that will appear in the fall issue of the Journal of
Aesthetic Education, published by the University of Illinois Press,
suggests that those instruments should be hauled out and tuned up.
According to the report, written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive
psychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed
by Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education,
something happens to young children when they are given keyboard
lessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts,
and for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on
spatial reasoning tests improves.
</P>
<P>
   That observation was the genesis of the term ``Mozart effect,''
which has been trademarked by the musician and author Don Campbell,
although his new book, ``The Mozart Effect For Children,'' to be
published in September by William Morrow, is unrelated to the study
that started the debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the original 1993 study, Gordon L. Shaw and Frances H.
Rauscher showed that a small group of college students performed
better on certain spatial-reasoning tests after listening to a
Mozart sonata. The so-called ``effect'' _ an increased ability to
``see'' the design of a snowflake, for example, after mentally
cutting and folding a piece of paper, or to rotate and compare
objects conceptually in space _ lasted only 10 to 15 minutes, but
the news was treated like a formula to get smart quick.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music seemed like the latest mega-vitamin: a little
hard to swallow, but so good for you. The theory, which made the
rounds of magazines in cover stories, quickly found its biggest
audience in the conscientious parents of young children and to the
parents of children-to-be, who hurried to buy specially packaged
music CDs so they could play Pachelbel's Canon to their babies in
utero.

   In Georgia, no purchase was necessary for newborns. Gov. Zell
Miller, citing the Mozart effect, proposed in 1998 providing the
parents of every Georgia newborn with a classical music cassette or
compact disc. Sony produced the albums free, and they were included
in gift packets at hospitals. The Mozart data was absorbed into
current views of cognitive development, and parents rushed to
improve those new brains.

   Some neuroscientists, however, cringed at the simplistic
scenario. So did Rauscher, who cautioned against distorting her
team's modest findings. The Mozart hype, especially in relation to
infants, was ripe for puncturing, and Dr. John Bruer obliged in his
book, ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' published last fall by
Free Press. Bruer, president of the McDonnell Foundation in St.
Louis, which finances research in neuroscience and cognition,
argued that no one need rush to program music or anything else into
babies' brains. The brain, he reassured parents, was most likely
malleable for life.
</P>
<P>
   Hetland, whose work addresses college students as well as
preschool and elementary-school children, conducted two
comprehensive analyses of all the known studies of the subject as
part of Project Zero's Reviewing Education in the Arts Project,
which she served as manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the first analysis, more than 2,000 college students
participating in 31 studies listened to several different kinds of
music, as well as to silence and to a vocal-relaxation tape. They
scored higher on spatial-reasoning tests after they heard Mozart,
Schubert and Mendelssohn than under any other conditions, including
listening to music by Philip Glass, Pearl Jam and other rock
groups. Music with a complex structure and rhythm won out over
repetitious, more predictable music, Hetland said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of music in the schools say that it is good, but not
enough, to sit children in an auditorium and present them with a
well-played rendition of ``Peter and the Wolf.'' For children to
benefit most, they need to make music themselves, those advocates
say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hetland's second analysis showed that. It involved 700
preschool and elementary school children who participated in 15
different studies. Some children received weekly 15-minute periods
of active music instruction, both individually and in groups. They
listened to music and moved to its rhythms, played percussion
instruments like triangles, rhythm sticks and cymbals, sang and
took piano lessons. The control groups received either passive
music instruction, computerized reading and arithmetic instruction
or no special instruction.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the before-and-after scores on spatial-reasoning
tests of the children who received active music instruction was
much greater than the gaps in the scores of the children in the
control groups, Hetland said. She defined spatial skill as the
ability to conceive of and understand the placement of objects and
images in two- or three-dimensional space. The test scores of
children who learned to read notes on a musical staff jumped
highest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does give music education advocates a lobbying tool, if
they want to justify a music program,'' Hetland said. Surgeons,
engineers and archaeologists need spatial skills. So do artists and
chess players. ``Spatial instruction is a great way to teach
math,'' she said. ``If you can enhance people's spatial ability
through a program of music instruction, we're not sure why, but
most kids would benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of an explanation for the demonstrated benefit of
music instruction keeps controversy bubbling in the overlapping
fields of cognitive science and early-childhood education. Does
music per se improve mental gymnastics? Or is the spatial-reasoning
effect a result of something else _ the spatial patterns made by
the black and white keys on the keyboard, perhaps, or a factor like
change of mood after participating in music?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Glenn Schellenberg, an associate professor of psychology
at the University of Toronto, is skeptical about the Project Zero
report. ``Just because there's an association doesn't mean it's
causal,'' he said. ``They've got to show that the effect is
specific to music. The right experiment has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Schellenberg has a $150,000 grant from the International
Foundation for Music Research in San Diego to give 36 weeks of free
arts lessons to 6-year-olds, beginning in September, randomly
assigning groups of children to keyboard, voice or drama classes.
``We'll be looking to see whether the two music groups show greater
levels of improvement on before-and-after-tests than the drama
groups,'' he said, ``and whether the two music groups differ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' he added, ``music could be special.''

   But some music teachers are impatient with the plodding
scientific approach. ``I don't need proof,'' said Lisha Papert
Lercari, director of the Music and the Brain Project of the 42nd
Street Development Fund in Manhattan, which has developed a
keyboard program that is now being taught in 23 schools ``The kids
are discovering form and patterns, and noticing things we never
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the keyboard training, which involves reading music,
also helped immigrant Hispanic children in Queens pick up English
unusually fast, a language effect she expects to document in a
nearly completed study.
</P>
<P>
   Educators like Lercari regard Rauscher, one of the original
Mozart-effect researchers, as their spokeswoman. Not surprisingly,
Rauscher was elated by the advance news of Hetland's report. ``I
think that to ignore these findings is really to do a disservice to
the children who can benefit most from them, especially
disadvantaged children,'' Rauscher said. ``These are kids whose
parents can't afford the time or the money to take them to piano
lessons. They really rely on the public schools for this, and a
prekindergarten program would be the ideal place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher, a former concert cellist who is now an assistant
professor of cognitive development at the University of Wisconsin
at Oshkosh, has conducted her own research since 1993 and
consistently found higher spatial-reasoning scores correlating with
keyboard and xylophone instruction for elementary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Singing also has its place in the new emphasis on musicmaking.
In White Plains, N.Y., which was recently named one of the top 10
communities in the country for music education in a survey
conducted by the American Music Conference, the National
Association for Music Education, the Music Teachers National
Association and the National School Boards Association, singing is
being integrated into prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Niss, coordinator of fine arts programs in the White
Plains schools, said that if kindergarten children are learning
about the letter ``S,'' for example, they may sing songs about
snakes and starfish. Musical counts help illustrate groups of
numbers, while songs sung in connection with pictures facilitate
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen changes in children's language development faster
than we normally would,'' she said. The district is 35 percent
Hispanic, and like Lercari, Niss said that Hispanic children
arriving in school without knowledge of English ``are acquiring the
language more quickly'' after their exposure to the music program.
</P>
<P>
   With a $100,000 three-year grant, provided by Texaco and the
Eastman School of Music through their Partnership Opportunities
program, the district recently extended its program to
prekindergarten students and brought Linda P. Neelly, an
early-childhood music consultant in Rochester, into the lower
grades to work with music teachers and classroom teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Neelly gathered kindergarten students in a
circle and asked them to take turns singing their names as she beat
the rhythm on a tambourine. Then, in a clear and melodious voice,
she repeated what each child had sung, enticing the children into a
musical conversation as they drew or worked on group activities.
When groups of children drifted over to a xylophone on the floor,
she used it to make up songs with them.
</P>
<P>
   The class illustrated Neelly's view that music should flow
naturally throughout the school day, much as the arts are taught
``through the curriculum'' in some middle and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen, classroom teachers must also become
musicmakers, and part of Neelly's job was to show them how. For
example, one technique was to ask the teachers to sing in a higher
key than normal so that children could replicate the sound.
``Children will sing in tune if they sing higher,'' Niss said.
</P>
<P>
   All the musical failures critics portray seemed to fall on the
small shoulders of Aifa, who was silent when it was her turn to
sing her name in a White Plains classroom. ``I don't know how to
sing,'' she said, crestfallen. Neelly moved on to the next child,
but when the group sang together later, Aifa joined in. No longer
in the spotlight, she found her natural voice, which, music
advocates say, is like finding herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child has innate musical capacity,'' Neelly said. ``If
we're not tapping in and finding ways to develop that ability,
we're not doing our job as educators.''
