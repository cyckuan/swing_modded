	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The two public university systems in  
the nation's most populous state have agreed to require the same 
high school course work for admission. 
</P>
<P>
	The two systems have different mandates. The more prestigious  
University of California schools consider only the top one-eighth 
of the state's high school seniors, while California State 
University, dubbed the ``people's university,'' takes the top 
one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	The systems also have had slightly different class requirements  
for admission. That often has forced students to choose which 
standards to satisfy or has made them take extra courses to meet 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new requirements, incoming CSU freshmen will be  
required to have an extra year of high school laboratory science 
and another of social science; UC will require a year of art, dance 
or music classes. 
</P>
<P>
	CSU's governing board unanimously approved the new plan on  
Wednesday. The University of California regents approved the 
guidelines in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The new requirements will begin with this year's crop of high  
school freshmen. The standards apply to all students who apply, 
whether they are from California or outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements include four years of English; three years of  
math; two years of social science; two years of lab science, two 
years of foreign language; one year of visual or performing arts 
and one year of electives.
