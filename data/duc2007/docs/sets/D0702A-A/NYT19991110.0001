   NEW YORK _ After a long morning of drills in reading,
third-graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent
an hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco
music. Their small hands spiraled and their sneakers thumped as a
professional dancer, Andrea Del Conte, guided them through stomps
and whirls in a classroom with mirrored walls and glossy floors.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750
students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative
writing. Poems paper the school walls, parents sew costumes for
special dance performances, and teachers gamely join students in
daily artistic experiments linked to the subjects they are
studying. Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and
language arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The school has developed a comprehensive arts program in
partnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural
institutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped
write the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach
students about different art forms.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have
increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and
theaters for lessons in art, music and dance. They began to do so
in the 1970s, when the city's near-bankruptcy eliminated hundreds
of arts instructors. Now, cultural institutions as large as the New
York Philharmonic and as small as neighborhood dance troupes have
become a permanent part of the city's educational landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the
institutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving
occasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping
schools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance
into every academic subject.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions are involved not just to improve arts
education, but out of self-interest: They want to cultivate future
audiences and impress potential donors at a time when improving
public education is considered an especially pressing and honorable
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training
teachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for
school children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city
for seven visits per class over a school year. The Roundabout
Theater sends teaching artists to 40 classrooms in the city for 10
visits each. Those artists teach students about reading, writing,
directing and acting in plays as part of their language arts and
social studies curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Artists from Lotus Music and Dance Studios in Chelsea work
intensively with six schools across the city, including Public
School 156, teaching students about the music and dance of
different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for such programs is striking at a time when city
schools are under intense pressure to prepare students for
increasingly rigorous standardized tests. While Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on
reading and math, they have also increased the arts education
budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and
music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every
classroom, but in this flush economy, private foundations are
joining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education
partnerships. Most notably, the philanthropist Walter Annenberg
pledged $12 million to New York City schools in 1993 for academic
offerings in the arts in a matching-fund program that is to total
$36 million. So far, 81 schools have received grants, most of them
$75,000 a year, to develop programs with nonprofit institutions.

   ``The question now is not whether to teach the arts, but how to
put them at the core of everything a school does,'' said Hollis
Headrick, executive director of the Center for Arts Education,
which oversees the Annenberg partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Even with the infusion of money and the enthusiasm of cultural
institutions, progress in arts education is slow. Some institutions
report tensions with teachers who say the programs occupy too much
time. So far, only the most motivated schools are truly integrating
the arts into their curriculums, a process that requires extra work
and money and a willingness to drastically change teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   This week, educators from 40 countries are discussing how to
speed the progress at the International Conference on the Future of
Arts Education, sponsored by the New York International Festival of
the Arts, at IBM's conference site in Palisades, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today
need an education that recognizes a much wider range of
intellectual abilities and ways of communicating,'' said Ken
Robinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts
education at the University of Warwick in England.
</P>
<P>
   Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their
expertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single
lecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom
visits and teacher training by several teaching artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so much extra work to start something like this,''
said Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and
Dance Studios, which Public School 156 is paying about $40,000 this
year to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 156 last week, the principal, Martha
Rodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who
were learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked
down the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems
about things that comfort them _ part of a project on Native
Americans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers
and Writers Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Dennis, let the ideas flow through you!'' she told a
boy who had put down his pencil after writing one line. She clapped
loudly when another student read a poem that began, ``Oh dresser
drawer, you smell so good with your aroma of fried chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at Public
School 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the
school won an Annenberg grant two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reading scores have improved every year, and I can say
that our children now enjoy writing,'' Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the
arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students
that they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and
science. After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last
week, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while
the rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her
favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do it, it's fun,'' she said. ``But my uncle told me
that if I study math I'll get a college degree.''

<P>
   One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they
value math is to measure student progress with traditional
assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by
introducing standards that outline what students should learn
through arts instruction. But Terry L. Baker, an education
consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the
Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess
a student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual''
subjects as music and painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be
held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he
said. ``But we are still some distance from figuring out the best
way to do that.''
