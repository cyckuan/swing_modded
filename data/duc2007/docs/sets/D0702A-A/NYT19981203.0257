 ARTS EDUCATION GETS A TECHNOLOGICAL BOOST

   Gift-giving seasons come and go, but gloomy reports about the
state of the educational system appear to be as eternal as a
holiday fruitcake. Fortunately, a slew of new online and off-line
arts-education resources has arrived to help alleviate the latest
slice of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of schoolchildren is close to being
arts-illiterate, according to a recent study by the National Center
for Education Statistics. The survey of eighth graders found that
fewer than one in four attend schools where dance or theater is
offered, and only 25 percent could pick out a Cubist work from
among four paintings. (The nation seems to be training a population
of bad guessers, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley said the study
``verifies that most American children are infrequently or never
given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music,
the arts or theater. That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What's right is that an increasing number of educators are using
technology to interest children in the arts, just as their
colleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics
of reading, writing and 'rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said last week that it
would spend $27 million to add a new children's center to its famed
Media Laboratory. Areas of research will include new digital
techniques for music, dance, storytelling and the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Arts education is important, and technology will be an essential
element in that educational process, said Mitchel Resnick, an
associate professor at MIT who is involved in planning for the
children's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the richest learning experiences come when people are
involved in designing, creating and expressing, and generally there
aren't enough of those experiences in the lives of children,'' he
said. ``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new
technologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with
those technologies than previous generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger
paints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited. We
want to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling
clay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of
expressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one intriguing program is already under development at
MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will
allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments
such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar.''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two
other high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already
opened their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Zeum, an art and technology center for children that
opened on Oct. 31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for
interactive art. Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot
structure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp -- a skateboarder's
dream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a
crew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using
visuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising. Ultimately, the
videos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of
recent creations can be accessed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila
Bergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and
indicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.
Already, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for
teens.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an
interactive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's
extensively renovated performance complex. In the A-Musing Room,
young visitors plug their hand-held ``instrument boxes'' into a
computer system that introduces them to such musical basics as
rhythm and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Many new digital arts-education resources can be experienced at
home. The composer Morton Subotnick has just premiered ``Making
More Music,'' a CD-ROM that provides more advanced exercises than
the fundamentals found in its highly regarded predecessor, ``Making
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   At the disk's core are two areas, ``Rhythm Band'' and ``Chamber
Music,'' that enable aspiring composers to draw marks on a page of
on-screen sheet music. The marks can then be converted into
standard musical notation and, more important, audible sounds.
Hearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of
photographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom. The disk's
graphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly
overcome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even
when a string of random marks is drawn on the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy
arts-education ventures. ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the
ever-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last
month and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying
teachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.
</P>
<P>
   But there is already much fun to be had. The student-activities
section of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth
of interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary
(``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated
(``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always know they're interested in the (art)
object,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director. ``One of the
things that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a
variety of life experiences. There's so many stories there, there's
so many opportunities to be charmed by discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but
similar program in the works. ``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be
launched Dec. 12, will provide interactive exercises like a
Java-enabled area for making collages. However, a recent addition
to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal
mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's
display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.
</P>
<P>
   Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an
educational vision. And that, said MIT's Resnick, is perhaps the
most essential element of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact of getting a lot of technology out there will
not necessarily do anything for the arts,'' he said. ``In fact,
without active effort, it won't be productive at all. You can put
all the finger paints in the world out there in kindergarten, and
that's not necessarily going to lead to great artists.''
