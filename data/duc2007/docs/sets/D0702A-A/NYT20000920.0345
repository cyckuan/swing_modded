HARVARD STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON `MOZART EFFECT'

   In findings that will dismay some arts advocates, a Harvard
study released Wednesday casts doubt on the link between the arts
and academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard
researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music
improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art
classes help students read better or score higher on tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying don't use the arts in presenting other
topics,'' said study co-author Lois Hetland, a psychologist
affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Education. ``We're
saying don't risk putting all your eggs in the basket that art will
raise math scores, because the evidence is not strong enough to
support that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has
written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea
that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the
connection between music and thinking defies measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create
different perceptions and sensations within different regions of
the brain,'' Campbell said. ``The Mozart effect is far more than
any one study can measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University
of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago. In that
study, a small group of college students did better on certain
spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a
piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata
for Two Pianos in D Major.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings from the Wisconsin researchers not to read too
much into the results, the study spawned a cottage industry of
classical music videotapes and CD's designed to help infants, or
even fetuses, think better. Georgia and a handful of other states
even began handing out classical music CD's to new mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, advocates for school art and music classes, trying to
reverse decades of budget cuts by cost-conscious school boards,
began pointing to the Wisconsin study and others like it to bolster
their arguments. Given the national obsession with high-stakes
tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music
classes as a way to boost test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study suggests they should take a different tack.
Hetland and co-author, Ellen Winner, discovered a connection
between music and spatial thinking and between drama and verbal
skills such as reading, writing, and oral understanding. But they
didn't find any solid evidence that music, art and dance improve
reading, or that classes in the arts improve test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Hetland says she's a strong supporter of art and music classes,
but that they deserve a place in the curriculum on their own
merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask history to justify itself on the basis of whether
it raises English scores. It's valuable on its own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Rose of the Creative Movement and Arts Center near Boston,
has been introducing children to music and dance for 20 years. She
said music has a developmental impact, if not a direct academic
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music really enhances the learning experience, even if it
doesn't necessarily spawn geniuses or people who excel in
particular areas,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can
affect overall student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Aprill of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education said
expanding the arts in Chicago schools has improved students'
attitudes toward other subjects, spurred parents to get more
involved, and even raised test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the arts become integrated into the curriculum they are
an important part of whole school improvement that shouldn't be
ignored,'' Aprill said.
