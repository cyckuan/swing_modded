   NEW YORK _ As a young girl in Trinidad, Cynthia Leveine used to
peek from her windows to catch a glimpse of the steel bands,
defying her parents, who forbade her to listen to the popular
street music that was tapped out on refurbished 55-gallon metal
drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dared not ask about it,'' said Ms. Leveine, who is now in
her 50s and lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. ``It was the music
for the people who lived on the other side of the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Leveine, who immigrated to New York 30 years ago, vowed
that her children would not only listen to the soothing sound; they
would also learn to play the steel drum, or pan, as it is commonly
called. And to her joy, Ms. Leveine's 22-year-old daughter,
Jacquii, a music major at City College, has been playing the steel
drum for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The drumming of Jacquii Leveine is part of a rising sound of the
pan in those New York City neighborhoods transformed by the large
influx of Caribbean immigrants. Reflecting a growing appreciation
for steel drums in the Caribbean and around the world, the drum has
even taken a place next to the trumpet and clarinet as a musical
option for students at some city schools. Its popularity has been
increased immeasurably by the annual West Indian American Day
Carnival, the sprawling pageant that showcases the artistry of the
steel drum.
</P>
<P>
   This is all a bit of a passage for the pan, which was once
burdened by its image as an instrument of rabble-rousers _ an image
promoted earlier this century by Trinidad's British rulers, who saw
the music as a magnet for subversive gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way the world turns,'' said the elder Ms. Leveine.
``Parents are realizing the value of the instrument. Music is music
no matter how and who plays it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, many public schools now offer
steel drum classes as part of their music education programs, and
professional pan players who migrated from Trinidad and other
islands are offering private lessons. Many bands that take part in
the Carnival celebration are also conducting classes for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments, which were once fashioned crudely out of used
oil drums, are now custom-made at several storefronts in Brooklyn
where entrepreneurs make a living carving, tuning and painting
drums for sale. They sell for about $500 to $900, said William
Jones, a steel drum aficionado from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, who now form the core of many steel bands in
Brooklyn, hold jam sessions in so-called pan yards, a term borrowed
from the outdoor sites where steel drums are played in the
Caribbean. They are drawn to the pan yards by camaraderie and by
the sound of the drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's like another language,'' said Horace Moore, 17, of
East Flatbush, who was at a steel drum jam session on a recent
night at the St. Francis of Assisi Church on the edge of Crown
Heights in Brooklyn. ``At its highest, the steel drum has a crisp,
straight sound with no aftereffect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole McCarthy, 17, who was playing a double drum set nearby,
chimed in: ``It's really soothing. It's like you're in this groove
and you're making a sound unlike anything we're used to here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy's friend Sandra Thompson, 17, pointed to Ms.
McCarthy and said: ``I started playing because of her. I used to go
to her house, and her father and her played it and it sounded good.
So now I'm into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel drum is trimmed with chisels and tuned with sledge
hammers. It produces muted, bell-like tones. As a solo instrument,
the steel drum does not compare well with some other instruments
like the guitar. But in an orchestra, it produces a full, melodic
sound. A typical steel band ranges in size from about 10 to 140
members, each playing drum in tenor, soprano, baritone and bass.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The origin of the steel drum as an instrument is credited to
Winston Simon, a popular Trinidadian musician who recognized in the
1930s that a dented section of a barrel head produced a tone. The
instrument was assailed by the British colonials, who ruled
Trinidad from 1797 to 1962, as a tool for popular uprising and
banned its playing. The British view of steel drums took hold in
the upper reaches of Trinidad's society.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967, however, the drum's stigma had begun to lift. Now the
steel drum, which carries the full chromatic range of notes and
produces just about any type of music from classical to calypso,
has become as much an icon of the region as a swaying palm.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200 professional steel bands throughout
Trinidad, and steel drum is taught side by side with mathematics
and science in most schools. Nearly every school has a steel band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steel pan is a natural art form,'' said William Jones, founder
and executive director of the Caribbean American Sports and
Cultural Youth Movement, which runs one of the largest steel bands
in New York, a perennial winner of the Carnival's band contest.
``It comes out of the black poor of the island. It is spontaneous
and at the same time formal.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of the instrument is also drawing non-Caribbean,
particularly black American, youngsters looking for a different
music than the blues, jazz or hip-hop that dominate their musical
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never explored this sound before,'' said William
Johnson, 19, a psychology major at Medgar Evers College in Crown
Heights, who is not of Caribbean ancestry. ``I wanted to try it.
It's a delicate instrument; you have to hit the notes just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel drum has gained momentum in the city's public schools,
which received $25 million last September from the administration
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to restore arts and music programs that
were cut several years ago. Schools like George W. Wingate High
School in Brooklyn have used some of the money to buy more steel
drums and to expand steel drum classes.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Morgano, the school board's director of arts education for
Brooklyn, said that having steel drum classes helps ease the
transition for newly arrived Caribbean students.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it opens American-born students to something
different. ``I see it growing,'' Morgano said of steel drum classes
in the public schools. ``I think you will see that instrument
introduced in a more avant-garde sort of way by blending it with
other instruments.''
