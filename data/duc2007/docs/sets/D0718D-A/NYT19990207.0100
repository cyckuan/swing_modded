A NEW MAGAZINE, BY WAY OF STARBUCKS 
 (DW)

   NEW YORK _ Time Inc. has joined forces with Starbucks, the
coffeehouse giant responsible for caffeinating seven million
Americans every week. The two companies will start publication this
summer of Joe, a cultural review that will be sold in the 2,000
Starbucks stores sprinkled across the United States and Canada as
liberally as the chocolate powder on top of a double-mocha
cappuccino grande.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his
editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one
encounters in a coffeehouse. To that end, the magazine's subtitle
will be ``Life is Interesting. Discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds similar to the subtitle for Tina Brown's Talk _
hers is ``The American Conversation'' _ it is purely coincidental,
Mowbray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't inviting comparisons to anyone,'' he said. ``It's
going to be a cultural magazine, but not in the gray sense, not in
the review sense.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 copies of the first 84-page issue, which will cost
$3, will arrive in Starbucks stores in June. Three bimonthly issues
are planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said:
``Starbucks has emerged as the third place, between home and work,
in America. It is the true extension of people's front porch. What
people do inside Starbucks is talk, and coffee has been the
centerpiece of conversation for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Long, president of media sales and marketing at Time
Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc., is not as interested in
conversation as he is in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can sell a copy and a half a day in each of their
stores, we'll make a bunch of money,'' Long said, adding that
producing a magazine for a chain that already provides distribution
eliminates all the costs of building circulation. ``Our
distribution costs are zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Starbucks already has alliances with United Airlines,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and the Starwood hotel chain, Joe has natural
advertisers. General Motors, which is not affiliated, has signed up
for several pages of advertising in the first issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz would not say what writers already had delivered pieces
for Joe, but he said he had spoken to Garry Trudeau and Nora Ephron
about contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see `You've Got Mail'?'' he asked, referring to the
movie Ms. Ephron wrote and directed. ``She used Starbucks almost
like a character in the movie. It was incredible.''
