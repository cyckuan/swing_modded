 _ SF CHRON  
 Kitchenware Giant Rejects Takeover Bid  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; Unlike its fancy blenders and armchairs, Williams-Sonoma Inc.
apparently is not for sale.
<P>
   The San Francisco kitchen and housewares merchant, which owns
the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores and catalogs, spurned a
takeover offer in an emergency board meeting earlier this month,
according to sources close to the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHoward Lester
declined yesterday to discuss the situation, saying, ``Nothing is
going on now. From time to time, people have discussions, but we
don't comment on those.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma is considered a ripe takeover target. It is a
well-run company with a bright future on the Web and a relatively
low valuation, said industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   With its stock trading at about $29, the company's current
market capitalization is $1.62 billion. Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, values it at closer to $3 billion,
or $41 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, several sources named Starbucks Corp., the Seattle
coffee giant, as the likely suitor. A Starbucks spokesman declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma seem an odd match at
first blush, it makes sense when their Internet strategies are
factored in, said analysts and other observers.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Oxygen
Media to develop a lifestyle-oriented portal and cable television
business targeting upscale women. Williams-Sonoma, which has just
begun rolling out a series of cyber gift registries and online
stores, would be the perfect e-commerce addition, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starbucks customer is 55 percent women, well educated,
over $75,000 median income, and over 70 percent of them use the
Net,'' said Tonneson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same people who shop at Williams-Sonoma and the ideal
demographic for patronizing cooking and epicureal type stuff on the
Web,'' Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williams-Sonoma's larger stores would be good
locales for small Starbucks coffee bars, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma is a particularly attractive Web partner because
of its strong stable of brand names, including Hold Everything and
Chambers; its decades of direct-to-consumer experience; and its
technological infrastructure, which includes a strong Web operation
and a large, sophisticated distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williams-Sonoma's valuable customer database of 20
million names, addresses and buying histories will be an even more
powerful tool when the company is able to mesh the list with e-mail
addresses, said an industry analyst who declined to be identified
by name.

 &QL; 
 &LR;  So a lifestyle portal deal does make sense for Williams-Sonoma _
but the company decided to pursue just such an opportunity with a
different set of partners, not Starbucks and Oxygen, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, just three days after the weekend board meeting
at which Williams-Sonoma's directors voted to remain independent,
the retailer announced that it is talking to CondeNet, an affiliate
of Conde Nast magazines, about joining a CondeNet-Time Warner cable
and Web business targeting high-income women. Williams-Sonoma has
already arranged to start selling kitchen wares over CondeNet's
Epicurious.com site.
</P>
<P>
   So it looks like Williams-Sonoma will go it alone for now,
although there is nothing to stop future bids. ``Something's going
to happen there,'' said one industry executive. ``Eventually,
somebody's going to have too much money to leave them alone.''
