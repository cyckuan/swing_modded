COFFEE, TEA MARRIAGE LOOKS SWEET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE - The nation's tea industry has seen its great, shining
hope - and thinks it might be Starbucks Coffee Co.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet aroma of opportunity wafted through the tea business
Tuesday as it absorbed the stunning news that Seattle's gigantic
java retailer plans to purchase the highly respected, quirky tea
maker Tazo, of Portland, Ore., for an undisclosed amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this marriage is gigantic for the world of
specialty tea,'' said Joe Simerini, president of the Tea
Association, a New York-based trade group. ``What it pretty much
tells you is Starbucks has made up their mind that they want to be
in the world of the specialty tea business, and they want to be in
it in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks remained largely mum on its plans this week, saying
only that it planned to develop new products under the Tazo name
and possibly create a new retail format around the brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the universe of tea brewing, that's practically cause for
celebration. U.S. tea makers have spent most of the 1990s watching
themselves get almost totally eclipsed by their highly caffeinated
brethren. While Americans slowly clued in to the joys of herbal
infusions and the fine nuances of specialty tea blends, they
embraced espresso drinks with an enthusiasm that left the quietly
prospering tea market looking like an also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo was born five years ago in the midst of America's
blossoming love affair with lattes. Founder Steven Smith, formerly
of Portland-based Stash Teas, drew on years of experience in the
industry to create a line of high-quality, high-priced products
that stood out both for their funky marketing (names like Awake and
Om) and distinct flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially thought we needed to change the way people
perceived tea,'' Smith said in a telephone interview Monday
afternoon. ``We bet on the fact that the tea category was not price
sensitive. We thought if we made better products, people would buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand quickly became one of the major players in the
specialty tea market, which the Tea Association describes as one
that emphasizes the quality and integrity of the ingredients. Other
specialty tea makers, according to the association, include
Bigelow, Twinings and the Republic of Tea.
</P>
<P>
   Of an overall annual tea market of $4.5 billion, specialty tea
sales accounted for about $500 million last year, Simrany said.
That's double the figures of a decade ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks alone reported $1.1 billion in retail sales for fiscal
1998. Tea sales made up only 1 percent of that total, chief
executive Howard Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo's impending sale to Starbucks - the deal is set to close at
the end of this month - catapults the niche tea maker into the
realms of such household names as Lipton and Celestial Seasonings,
said Brian Keating, owner of the Teacup, a retail teahouse and shop
on Queen Anne Hill and publisher of ``U.S. Tea Is `Hot,''' an
annual report on the tea industry.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also gives Starbucks the foothold it has sought
for years in the specialty tea market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks has been floundering,'' Keating said, testing out a
slew of items from chai tea to the iced blended drink Tiazzi this
summer to various takes on its in-house hot tea brand called
Infusia, all to mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Tazo gives the company a proven brand with a built-in cache.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business analysis standpoint, I couldn't think of a
better marriage,'' Keating said of the Starbucks-Tazo deal. ``It
was like two people you wanted to introduce and never thought about
introducing them to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Rasmussen, executive director of the Long Beach,
Calif.-based American Premium Tea Institute, was a bit more
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on this purchase and it's absolutely fabulous news for
my industry or it's really sad news,'' she said. ``It's not one of
those gray things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starbucks is going to take a mover and a shaker in my industry
and either really, finally do something with tea - or Tazo's going
to become this dusty, back-of-the-shelf product in Starbucks
stores, and that's going to be a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impetus for Starbucks to take the Tazo purchase
seriously must be pretty strong, given recent trends in the
specialty coffee business, Rasmussen said.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Specialty Coffee Association trade show, for
instance, Rasmussen noted, at least 50 percent of the vendors
devoted half their exhibit space to tea products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have reached their limit with coffee in terms
of their experience with it,'' she said. ``It's `What's the next
thing?' I don't want to say they're bored. But they are looking for
the next new beverage.''
