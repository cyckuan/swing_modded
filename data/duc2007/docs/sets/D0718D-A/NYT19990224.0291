 &HT;    Starbucks expansion plans stick with big cities

   Ask for a skinny decaf grande Espresso Macchiato in Marfa and
you might get some strange looks. Forget about getting a hot cup of
Guatamala Antigua in Goldthwaite.

<P>
   Don't look for that to change anytime soon.

<P>
   That's because while Starbucks Coffee, maker of the big-named
bean juices like those, is adding 500 stores this year, most are
planned for big cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood
before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the
company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest
of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 2,000 stores worldwide, including 106 stores in
Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston. Not even El
Paso has made the cut.

   In downtown Austin, where you can hardly hurl a stone without
hitting a Starbucks or some other java joint _ in some circles the
capital city has rapidly become the cappuccino city _ Starbucks is
opening at least one new store this year in mid-March at 24th and
Nueces streets just west of the University of Texas campus. The
Seattle-based company has opened nine Austin locations since coming
to town four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When determining where to place a new Starbucks, the company
looks at a number of demographic factors, including average age,
average income and whether a city's residents have been ordering
coffee from the company's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   While Starbucks may never make it to the Panhandle or the small
towns of East Texas, its presence still may be felt there. The
company tapped Pepsi-Cola Co. to sell its Frappuccino blended
coffee beverage, which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category,
said Schultz. Starbucks also joined Kraft Foods, Inc. in a
licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at
supermarkets around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in
America,'' said Schultz. ``We are going to have much, much more
than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise
you.''
