<HEADLINE> Starbucks To Acquire Tea Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired  
to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Starbucks hopes that with Tazo it can attract new  
customers. The company will discontinue its in-house Infusia brand 
of tea, which currently accounts for just 1 percent of Starbucks' 
$1.3 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tea will drive more people into our stores, and I think this  
is the highest-quality tea in the nation,'' said Howard Schultz, 
Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer. ``It's a much-loved 
brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo should be available in Starbucks stores by the end of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo calls itself ``The Reincarnation of Tea'' on its labels and  
cultivates a quirky image. The ingredients listing, for example, 
says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified 
tea shaman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tazo is sold in tea bags, in leaves and bottled as iced tea. Its  
blends include minty Refresh, chamomile-based Calm, citrus Wild 
Sweet Orange, and Passion, billed as a blend of hibiscus and other 
tropical flowers and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith, who founded Tazo in 1994, would not disclose what  
Starbucks paid for Tazo.
