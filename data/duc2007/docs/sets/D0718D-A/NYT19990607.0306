   Who better to write about heroes than heroes? That was the
thinking behind Time's ($3.95) ``Person of the Century'' project.
In the final installment of 20 nominees, Henry Aaron writes about
Jackie Robinson, and avid soccer fan Henry Kissinger offers his
views on Pele.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say certain people are bigger than life,'' Aaron writes,
``but Jackie Robinson is the only man I've known who truly was.''
</P>
<P>
   How was the list of nominees compiled? Time's editors say they
looked at people who liberated a segment of society. ``Jackie
Robinson broke the color line in baseball; Helen Keller demolished
old notions about the blind and deaf; Harvey Milk dared to put
himself on the ballot as an openly gay candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the old standby heroes such as Charles
Lindbergh, Muhammad Ali, Mother Teresa, Anne Frank and America's
GIs.

   &QR;  EYE-OPENER: When director Stanley Kubrick asked Frederic
Raphael to work with him on a script in 1994, the screenwriter for
``Darling'' and ``Two for the Road'' jumped at the chance.
Basically, Kubrick wanted to adapt an Austrian novel about a
devoted couple whose lives spin off into an erotic nightmare at a
masquerade ball in which they are separately propositioned.
Raphael, who describes his experiences with the temperamental
director in The New Yorker ($3), soon found himself in his own
nightmare. Kubrick wanted the script for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to be
unmistakably his, and he wanted to move the action from
turn-of-the-century Vienna to contemporary New York. Hadn't many
things changed since then, Raphael asked, including relations
between men and women? ``Think so?'' Kubrick said. ``I don't think
so.''

   &QR;  SHAGADELIC: The publicity machine for ``The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' is cranked and running at full speed, with Mike Meyers gracing
the covers of Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) and GQ ($3) this week.
Not surprisingly, the Entertainment Weekly article is little more
than an unabashed plug for the film. The more balanced GQ profile
delves into Meyers' background as the son of an Encyclopaedia
Brittanica salesman who died tragically after being diagnosed with
Alzheimer's. The elder Meyers was a major influence on his son's
sense of humor, writes John Brodie. ``He loved ... Peter Sellers,
Beyond the Fringe, Monty Python and the early `Saturday Night
Live.'''

   &QR;  COFFEE BREAK: Joe ($3), a magazine sold exclusively in
Starbucks stores, debuts June 16 with an impressive lineup of
articles, including a quirky essay by author Joy Williams about the
Unabomber's cabin. Produced under a joint agreement with Starbucks
and Time Inc., the magazine is slick and obviously aimed at a young
upscale audience. Much of the premiere issue takes an edgy look at
trust in human relationships. ``It is not a magazine about
coffee,'' says Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz, ``but it is
certainly inspired by the idea of coffeehouse culture.''

   &QR;  JUNGLE JANE: Robyn Burnham leads a swinging life, literally,
as a paleobotanist whose specialty is studying vines of the South
American rain forest. In an intriguing profile in the second issue
of Women Outside ($3.95), Kent Black follows the 42-year-old
Burnham deep into Ecuador's heart of darkness in search of
medicinal plants.

   &QR;  UNDER PRESSURE: Stress is a common complaint, but it's more
than an annoying byproduct of a frantic lifestyle. It can be a
killer, experts say in a Newsweek ($3.50) cover story. Scientists
acknowledge that living a stress-free life is not a realistic goal,
but there are ways to deal with tension. Suggested treatments
include meditation, massage, exercise and structured group support.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  QUICK READS: The readers of Jane ($2.95) voted the Rolling
Stones' ``No Security Tour'' as worst of 1999 in the magazine's
second annual entertainment poll. Second was Lilith Fair, followed
by the Spice Girls. ... Jezebel ($3.95) profiles superstar Shania
Twain and drag supermodel RuPaul in the June issue.
