<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Turkey's EU Membership </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISTANBUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said here Monday that Greece has no intention of
preventing Turkey from being admitted into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting
opening Monday morning in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul,
Pangalos said that Turkey is an European nation and its efforts
for full EU membership should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has always supported the European orientation of
Turkey. Greece is opposed to the view that the European Union is
limited by historic or religious traditions," Panglos said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Today's reality is different. Participation of
Turkey in the European Conference can be a successful first
step."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's
efforts for EU membership, but the charge is rejected by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Ankara halted its political dialog with the EU last December
when the EU Luxembourg summit excluded Turkey from the ranks of
candidates for its enlargement process, saying that the European
body made this decision on the basis of "a discriminative
attitude " toward the Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Regional security, such as the Kosovo issue, and economic
cooperation will be taken up at the two-day foreign ministerial
meeting of the Balkan countries.
