BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The east and central European
countries applying for European Union membership are requested to
inform their citizens about their move and the consequence.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, requested the applicant countries to improve public
knowledge and understanding of the union, to explain the
implications of accession into the union, and to explain the link
between the pace of preparations for membership and the progress
of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The request was put forward in a communication strategy made
public here on Thursday by the commission.

"The accession to the European Union of the central and eastern
European countries gives rise to expectations as well as fears,"
said EU education commissioner Viviane Reding. "The information
and communication campaign launched by the commission aims to
inform the European citizen, in an objective and reasoned way, of
the stakes and the challenges of enlargement."
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged EU member states to communicate the
reasons for enlargement to their citizens as well, to promote
dialogue at all levels of society between policy-makers and the
public on issues related to enlargement and to provide information
about the candidate countries to promote general understanding.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement awareness campaign will run from 2000 to 2006
with a budget of nearly 150 million euro (139 million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
EU enlargement commissioner Gunter Verheugen said on Thursday
that the year 2005 is the latest to see the enlargement process
complete. He added that 10 of the 12 applicant countries are
preparing for that date while two others are preparing for later
dates, though he would not be specific on the dates the applicant
countries would be admitted into the union.
