   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Turkey made the right choice in deferring the execution of
Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, until the European Court
of Human Rights hears his appeal. The decision took political
courage in a country where passions against Ocalan run high. But it
will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may
permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing
internal problem. Turkey is not obliged to follow the court's
ruling, but has obeyed its decisions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was seized in Kenya last February, brought to Turkey and
tried for the murder of the more than 30,000 people killed in the
Kurdish insurgency. He was convicted and sentenced to death last
June. Ocalan has tried to bargain for his life by offering to
broker an end to the 15-year-long Kurdish conflict. He has also
ordered his followers to withdraw from battle. As a result Kurdish
violence inside Turkey has sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Others with terrorist pasts, like Yasser Arafat of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and Gerry Adams of the Irish Republican
Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, have swapped violence for
political bargaining and contributed to peacemaking. Istanbul
should give Ocalan a chance to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about
Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death
penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished.
Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984. Ending that moratorium
would be a mistake. Turkey should not just postpone Ocalan's
hanging, but cancel it.  &QL;
