<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Strategy to Improve Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy
for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Commission Wednesday made the proposal in a bid to improve
its badly soured relations with Turkey over Ankara's frustrated
efforts to be accepted as a candidate for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
It urged the EU members to release a fund of some 375 million
ECUs (around 400 million U.S. dollars) to finance the strategy,
which includes a broader customs union and cooperation in
industry, services and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The European strategy which we proposed for Turkey will lead
to a deepening of our relations. This will be to the benefit of
all our citizens," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den
Broek said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Turkey's democratic institutions and human
rights records must be improved in order to prepare itself for the
eventual EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have made clear what we expect from Turkey and what
we have to offer for Turkey," said the commissioner, who also said
that Ankara was now not interested in political dialogue with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
In a second report to the European Parliament, the Commission
said the Turkish government's program for improving the human
rights situation and democratization "has not yet had sufficient
impact on the situation."
