<HEADLINE> Turkey Vexed Over Exclusion From EU-led Defense Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is angry over the European
Union (EU)'s decision to exclude it from a European defense
mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities in Turkey for
EU-led operations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday that Ankara was "not
satisfied with" the EU decision made Tuesday at the EU summit in
Portugal to exclude non-EU members from the so-called European
Security and Defense Identity (ESDI).
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry called on EU members to
reverse its decision at its next summit in Nice, France, in
December.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ESDI envisages the establishment of a decision-
making structure over defense under the EU, which would be
independent of the United States-led NATO and would exclude non-EU
members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member and EU candidate, has endeavoured to join
the European defense mechanism with the support of the U.S., who
fears the ESDI will take the place of the NATO and reduce
Washington's role in the European security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turkish defense officials said Ankara has been an active
contributor, within the framework of NATO, to European security
since the Cold War and should not be excluded from a European
security and defense architecture.
</P>
<P>
When Javier Solana, commissioner for EU foreign and security
affairs, visited Ankara early this month, Turkey voiced objections
to the ESDI on the grounds that non-EU members, like itself, would
be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insisted that it wants to be involved in the decision-
making, rather than the decision-implementing, process.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had also sent a diplomatic note of warning at the end of
May to 11 EU countries which are also NATO members over their
approach to the ESDI.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which did not want to see its role reduced in the
European security with the evolving structure of the ESDI, stressed
that it was not like other non-EU NATO members and had contributed
much to European security both in the Cold War and post-Cold War
eras.
