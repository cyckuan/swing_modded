<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Will React Strongly for Releasing EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece threatened Thursday to
react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a
155- million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved
by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas attributed the commission's decision to
"expediencies." Greece's reaction would be without delay, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Greece would increase its bilateral
contacts in order to promote the country's national interests in
the most effective way.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's proposal for the release of the EU
funds to Turkey, which was raised by External Affairs Commissioner
Hans Van Den Broek, was approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission's plan will prevent Greece from exercising its
right to veto by introducing a new regulation terming Turkey a
developing country, which requires only a special majority for
approval by the EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Greece blocked an aid package worth 450 million
dollars accompanying the EU-Turkey customs union.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Greece warned that it would refer the
European Commission to the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but
Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations
with Athens.
