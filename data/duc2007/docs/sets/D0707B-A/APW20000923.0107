<HEADLINE> Turkey Rights Activist Released  </HEADLINE>

   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's leading human rights activist was
released from prison Saturday and said he hoped to be the last
person jailed in Turkey under laws curbing freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Akin Birdal, former president of the independent Human Rights
Association, served 10 months in prison. He was convicted of
inciting racial hatred for urging an end to Turkey's 16-year war
against Kurdish rebels in the largely Kurdish southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope and wish is to be the last person imprisoned because
of writing and voicing ideas,'' Birdal said outside an Ankara
prison where he was greeted by 100 human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal said Turkey had not made concrete steps to improve its
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't the Turkish people deserve democratization?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is often criticized for its poor human rights record.
Europe and the United States have called on Turkey to crack down on
torture in police stations and reform its laws curbing freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal, 51, is still recovering from an assassination attempt in
May 1998, when two assailants shot him six times. Eleven members of
a far-right nationalist group were convicted and sentenced in
December 1998 to up to 19 months in prison for attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   He was released for health reasons last year after serving three
months, but was jailed again in March.
</P>
<P>
   Both the European Union and the United States criticized Turkey
for jailing Birdal. Scores of activists and writers have been
sentenced to prison terms in Turkey for writings and speeches seen
as sympathetic to Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 cases are still pending against Birdal for his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as a minority and
has rejected a cease-fire announced by the rebels last year. The
European Union, which Ankara wants to join, is pressing Turkey to
find a peaceful solution to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in fighting
since 1984.
