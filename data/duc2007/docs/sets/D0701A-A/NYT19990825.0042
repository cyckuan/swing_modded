 By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law
Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore
chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel ``The
Turner Diaries,'' much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was
overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists.
 &HT;    Now, with increasing numbers of white males targeting and
gunning down members of minority groups, Dees' failed book-banning
campaign _ although still unreasonable to most Americans, myself
included, on First Amendment grounds _ is not as unpalatable as it
once was.
 &HT;    The reason is that ``The Turner Diaries'' serves as a bible for
killers such as Tim McVeigh and Ben Smith and L.A. day camp
shooting suspect Buford Furrow.
 &HT;    Published in 1978 and set in the 1990s, the novel depicts
Armageddon between select whites and everyone else _ blacks, Jews,
government officials, journalists, cops, military personnel.
 &HT;    At this time, called the ``Day of the Rope,'' tens of thousands
of blacks and Jews are exterminated. This also is when the
``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms
of compassion.
 &HT;    Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts
and, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''
Even more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have
read it.
 &HT;    The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers
a glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for
inspiration:
 &HT;    ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.
Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile. It is the
world view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the
spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who
cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge,
pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the
lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''
 &HT;    ``One day we will have a truly American press in this country,
but a lot of editors' throats will have to be cut first.''
 &HT;    ```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out
during the last three decades of the Old Era. Women affected by it
denied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not
`women.'''
 &HT;    ``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan
outlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to
Jewish spiritual corruption.''
 &HT;    ``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and
resentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are
really at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to
behold.''
 &HT;    ``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every
neighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out
the majority of the population and reorienting their thinking. In
fact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary. The
people require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of
thought.''
 &HT;    ``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning. We must look at our
situation collectively, in a race-wide sense. We must understand
that our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery
in order to save his life. There is no sense in asking whether the
tissue being cut out is `innocent' or not. That is no more
reasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad
ones _ or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still
insist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of
their race.''
 &HT;    ``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the
last of Satan's spawn.''
 &HT;    After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons,
the ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It (is) no longer
sufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one (has) to be
judged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''
 &HT;    After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald,
who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in
Oregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner
Diaries.'''
 &HT;    An understatement, for sure. As head of the Neo-Nazi National
Alliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide,
Pierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls
``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the
Hillboro, W.Va., headquarters. There, the future stalwarts, who
mistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art
of hatred.
 &HT;    The main training manual? ``The Turner Diaries.'' Besides these
100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many
others, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own
way and re-enact its graphic mayhem.
