<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Guards Testify  </HEADLINE>

   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- One of two men convicted of
assaulting a woman and her son outside the headquarters of the
Aryan Nations denied being a member of the white supremacist group
Thursday during testimony in a civil rights case filed against
them, the Aryan Nations and the group's founder, Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center who is representing Victoria Keenan and her son, Jason,
introduced letters, photographs and depositions to contradict the
men's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards compensatory and punitive damages, the
Keenans could demand the Aryan Nations' assets, mainly the 20-acre
compound and the sect's buildings. Dees has publicly said he hopes
to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Keenan's lawyers described Jesse Warfield,
43, as a former Aryan Nations security chief and John Yeager, 21,
as former guard for the group. Both men are serving prison
sentences for the 1998 assaults, and another security guard, Shane
Wright, is a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield testified that he wasn't a member of the group when he,
Yeager and Wright jumped into his pickup with an assault rifle and
chased the Keenans' car after hearing a loud noise outside the
group's compound, north of Coeur D'Alene.
</P>
<P>
   He said he only chased the Keenans, who are part-white and
part-American Indian, to try to find out who had paid them to shoot
at the compound. No weapon was found in the Keenans' car, and
authorities theorize the guards mistook a car backfire for a
gunshot. Warfield said he ''always acted as if I was security
chief, even though I wasn't appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said he was drunk and didn't recall shooting an assault
rifle at the Keenans' car.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are representing themselves and testified that the
atmosphere surrounding the Aryan Nations compound in the months
leading up to a 1998 Aryan parade through town was one of
increasing paranoia that others would try to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The two denied lying to protect Butler, whom they consider to be
the protector of the white race.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, 82, has also said the men acted on their own. Edgar
Steele, a lawyer representing Butler and the corporation that
controls Aryan assets, has said he fears the Aryans' beliefs will
be scrutinized by the jury rather than the evidence. The lawyers
for the Ayran Nations have not begun calling witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kootenai County Justice Building, security has been
tight since the trial began Monday. SWAT team members scan the
crowd with binoculars from atop the building, visitors must pass
through a metal detector and there is a daily lottery for courtroom
passes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, federal agents were posing as journalists in the
crowd to photograph neo-Nazi skinheads who had been rallying
outside the courthouse. The sheriff's department on Wednesday
revoked the agents' false credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Capt. Ben Wolfinger admitted he initially directed
seven agents to obtain media passes so they could blend in better
with photographers covering the trial. I was surprised it became an
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the news media said it is dangerous for law
officers to pose as journalists. Such deceptions could lead to
physical threats against reporters, who are not armed, said Kyle
Niederpruem, national president of the Society of Professional
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials did not immediately return messages for comment.
