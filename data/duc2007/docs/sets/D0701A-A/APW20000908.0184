<HEADLINE> Idaho's Racist Image May Change  </HEADLINE>

   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Northern Idaho, predominantly white
and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist
Aryan Nations. It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for
hate.
</P>
<P>
   But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday
against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his
followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be
the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for
Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and
business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate.' I see it
as being very, very positive,'' Mend said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery, Ala., and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs,
said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the
Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.
</P>
<P>
   He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound
into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees
has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and
the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has
studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but
their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said,
adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of
individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.
</P>
<P>
   New technology, especially the Internet, also has allowed
extremists to reach a much larger audience at less cost. Some
organizations also have their own wealthy patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In Butler's case, Vincent Bertollini, a self-styled evangelist
in the anti-Semitic 11th Hour Remnant Messenger of Sandpoint,
offered to pick up the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bertollini reportedly made millions in California's Silicon
Valley before moving to northern Idaho to found his sect, which
pays for mass mailings of Christian Identity tracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is nothing. It's the idea,'' Bertollini said after
the verdict. ''What we are sending is a message. I can do it in any
city in the country. The message is separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, in fact, appeared confident after the verdict. Outside
the courtroom, the 82-year-old Butler said Idaho's Panhandle would
continue to be a haven for racists.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he applied for a parade permit to march in downtown
Coeur d'Alene either Oct. 15 or Oct. 28, said Julia Aho, deputy
city clerk. The application will be reviewed by police, who will
consider security issues, and then turned over to city leaders for
possible approval.
</P>
<P>
   The group's parade in 1998 attracted about 100 followers and
many more counter-demonstrators. In 1999, fewer than two dozen
marched.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County has about 220 blacks in an estimated population
of more than 100,000, Mend said. He downplayed Butler's claims,
saying only about 100 Aryan Nations members lived in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group
has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot
that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including
armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan
Berg in Denver. Most of the group's followers are in jail and its
leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's case, jurors found that Butler, his organization
and its corporate entity were negligent in the selecting and
overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans were chased, shot at and assaulted after they
stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the
Aryan Nations' compound. Jurors set $6 million as the punitive
award.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to bury the whole Aryan Nations,'' Judy Jacobson
said of her fellow jurors. The 45-year-old carpet layer said she
and two other jurors prevented the panel from awarding a much
higher judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to get the Aryan Nations out of the country,'' she
said. ''I'm not going to force this guy out of his property and his
home, just because you don't believe in his beliefs.''
