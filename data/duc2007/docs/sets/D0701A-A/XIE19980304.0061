<HEADLINE> Report: Hate Groups Growing in United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of organized hate
groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new
chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern
Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The research group based in Mongomery, Alabama, said 474 hate
groups and their chapters engaged in some form of racist behavior
in 1997, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The center used a different methodology to count the groups so
previous numbers cannot be directly compared. But if the old
methodology had been used, the latest figures would represent a 20
percent increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a
growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan
and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose
followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
</P>
<P>
The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and
rock music touting white power and advocating violence against
minorities, the report said. It said there are 163 Web sites that
advocate racial hatred; less than three years ago, there was one.
</P>
<P>
The report said one chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, the American
Knights, expanded from one to 12 chapters last year and that
racist and neo-Nazi Skinheads made a violent comeback in Denver,
Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in the 1970s
to battle racial bias, won major legal fights against the Ku Klux
Klan and other white supremacist groups. More recently it has been
tracking hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations across
the United States.
