   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ A federal grand jury has been hearing
evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed
four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs
in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently
began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mississippi, a white man pleaded guilty this summer, and
three others are to go on trial this week, in the 1970 killing of a
black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river.
</P>
<P>
   Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated
killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new
scrutiny. This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago
killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years,
was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging
white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil
rights leader Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had
complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and
the lesser-known of these cases. But recently their urgings have
been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the
South's political, social and legal climate has changed
significantly since the era of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for
these cases to be heard before today's racially diverse juries. At
the same time, more witnesses, perhaps with less fear of
retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden, are
coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an
urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is
realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in
the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we now have a black constituency that has
political clout, and a white constituency that is not against these
hatemongers being brought to justice,'' said David Sansing,
professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi.
``And the black constituency, emboldened by new-found political
power, is saying, `Justice delayed is justice denied, so let's quit
denying this justice.' Surprisingly, they are being met with
sympathy from district attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being
re-examined in the South. A few are before grand juries or are
being prosecuted. But some have only just begun to be
reinvestigated and have had little national attention.
</P>
<P>
   The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and
mostly white. Most are in their mid-40s to early 50s. A few have
childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the
Ku Klux Klan to school integration and black voter registration.
But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still
a stumbling block to the South's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prosecutors,'' Sansing said, ``are realizing that
they've got to do it now, rather than leave it unsettled forever.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, 45, a Birmingham native,
was 9 when Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, a center for
civil rights activity in the 1960s, was bombed, killing the four
girls. As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to
watch Bill Baxley, who was the Alabama attorney general,
successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time, in
the hope that better cases could be developed against them later.
When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997, he pushed for the
current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as
suspects in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to get back and reopen the case, and let the
community know that it's not forgotten, that's important for
everybody,'' Jones said. ``If you can bring it to closure, everyone
can finish the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases
today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated
some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it
was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.
Edgar Hoover, who was then the FBI director, prevented bureau
agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous
evidence they had collected. Now it is the bureau that is leading
the new investigation, along with Jones' office.
</P>
<P>
   The re-examination of the Birmingham bombing was a result of
meetings between local black religious and community leaders and
local bureau officials in the mid-1990s. Officials close to the
case now would not discuss specific evidence, but have said there
are no new suspects, only new information. Still, there are hints
at the direction in which the case is going.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three other suspects named in the original FBI report,
two are living: Tommy Blanton Jr. in Birmingham and Bobby Frank
Cherry in Texas. According to a book on the bombing, ``Until
Justice Rolls Down,'' by a Birmingham News reporter, Frank Sikora,
witnesses quoted in FBI files had named Cherry as the one who
placed the bomb at the church. Blanton was said to have owned a car
linked to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have maintained their innocence. The bureau interviewed
Cherry recently and some members of his family have appeared before
the grand jury hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing before the grand jury this summer were two white
supremacists J.B. Stoner and Robert Shelton. Stoner was convicted
in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell
with Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a
few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of
limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as
well as in all the other cases from that time.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law
with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite
in the bombing. He said there is also a possibility of using state
murder charges, which have no statute of limitations, as was done
in 1977 against Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994
in Jackson, Miss., of the former Klansman, Byron De La Beckwith,
who shot to death Evers, the field secretary of the Mississippi
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, . The
conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in
mistrials in the 1960s. The case inspired the film ``Ghosts of
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam,'' said Dees of
the law center, which keeps track of hate crimes and first called
attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links.
``It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope.''

</P>
<P>
   That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham
case. It also prompted the family of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi
to push for a trial in his 1966 killing. In 1998, a former Klan
leader, Sam Bowers, was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of
Dahmer, the Hattiesburg NAACP president.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by those successes, other families have begun pushing
in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known, long-ago
slayings linked to race. ``The South is still in the process of a
cleansing moment with these cases,'' said Myrlie Evers-Williams,
66, widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP.
``I'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice
as we did have moved forth. To see that pebble dropped in the water
and the ripples go out says something about justice in this
country. There is still hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the
public spotlight. Many prosecutors said they had been asked over
and over why they wanted to stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hear it from white people on the golf course,'' said Bob
Helfrich, 45, the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who
prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble, another man
charged in the Dahmer case, next spring. ``They say, `Haven't we
spent enough money on this?' I have blacks tell me not to mess with
this, too. It is costly. But you can't put a price on justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church
commemorating the victims of the bombing, police officers stood
guard outside. The church's pastor, the Rev. Christopher Hamlin,
said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued
to receive bomb threats, especially in the three years since the
case was reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the church, on a recent sunny day, Ronald
Roscoe, 47, a heating and air-conditioning technician, who is
black, was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park, near the
church's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing. A city
gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from
three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the
park to disperse civil rights protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the reopening of the bombing case, Roscoe said:
``It's a waste of time. I wish them luck, but after all this time I
don't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be
convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Shane Buggay, 32, an orthopedic surgeon, who is white,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get them, then those men should pay,'' Buggay
said. ``Time has nothing to do with it. They are still trying to
convict Nazis for war crimes from World War II. It is just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the recently resurrected cases in the South have
resulted in convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Belzoni, Miss., this summer one suspect was acquitted in the
1970 slaying of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper. Another man,
Joe Oliver Watson, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case this
summer and is awaiting sentencing. Three others are set to go on
trial Wednesday on charges of murdering Pool.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, earlier this year, a grand jury failed to indict
two suspects, both former Klansmen, in the 1957 slaying of Willie
Edwards Jr., a black truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Philadelphia, Miss., despite urging from the
families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are
investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18
men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of
three civil rights workers there in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including
Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the
Philadelphia killings.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the
Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he
encountered 20 years ago still exist. For instance, he said his
main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a
frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worried me,'' Baxley said, ``that they would look at him
and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody. So we had
to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or
uncle. They had to see the evil in this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging
witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already
died. In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no
transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in
better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the
Philadelphia, Miss., rights workers and the Birmingham church
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people
remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan. Two major witnesses,
whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in
the bombing, refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less
potent. In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's
five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that
Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all people remain the same all through their lives,'' said
Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which
has been investigating the case since 1996. ``When they are getting
close to their final days, they may say, `Well, it's time to clear
my conscience before I meet my maker.' That's what you hope for in
cases like this.''
