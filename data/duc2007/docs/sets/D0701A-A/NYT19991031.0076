   LOS ANGELES _ A judge has declined to order a reporter to
provide prosecutors and defense lawyers with notes and tape
recordings of an interview with a defendant in a racially charged
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent testified that the reporter told him that the
defendant, Randall Lee Rojas, had admitted committing a murder in
1995. He identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for
Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala. Lawyers for two of Rojas'
co-defendants, Ritch Bryant and Jessica Colwell, sought the
material as evidence that their clients had no hand in the Nov. 25,
1995, beating death of a black man, Milton Walker Jr.

<P>
   In a hearing on Oct. 27, Judge Lance A. Ito of the Los Angeles
Superior Court said the interview contained ``nothing close to
being exculpatory'' for the defense. He noted the material would
assist the prosecution's case, but found the evidence was available
through other means and that there was no need to pierce
California's shield law, which essentially protects reporters from
being compelled to provide evidence to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups, and
Intelligence Report covers right-wing extremists. Rojas' lawyer,
Donald Calabria, questioned how Ms. O'Kane had entered the Los
Angeles County Jail without filling out required media forms and
had interviewed his client without his knowledge. Judge Ito noted
that a Los Angeles sheriff's department investigator helped arrange
the interview and even participated, posing questions for Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Kane disclosed a portion of the interview to an FBI agent
about a month later, though her editor, Mark Potok, said in an
interview that the disclosure was inadvertent and that the
magazine's reporters do not collaborate with law enforcement
authorities.
