   HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho _ At 81, Richard Girnt Butler knows he's in
his twilight days. He hopes the rest of the world is too.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years, Butler has preached about ``the great race war''
from his swastika- and crucifix-adorned pulpit here in the Selkirk
Mountain foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the end-time period. I'd like to see the
final conclusion, but that's up to my Father,'' says Butler,
tromping across the United Nations and Israeli flags he uses as
doormats at the entrance to his chapel.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of creating a ``white homeland,'' the founder of
the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, Butler
has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism.
</P>
<P>
   Buford R. Furrow Jr., a former Aryan Nations security guard
charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five
in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler
disciple to make news for racist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Catholic priest sodomizes an altar boy _ and they've had
a whole string of them _ do you blame the church for it? The
pope?'' he asked in an interview at his office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While offering a safehouse for neo-Nazi pilgrims, Butler's
20-acre compound has also fostered disciples who engaged in murder,
robbery and racial assaults.
</P>
<P>
   According to civil rights groups, those with ties to Butler
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Members of The Order, who robbed armored cars and assassinated
Denver radio host Alan Berg in the 1980s;
</P>
<P>
   _Colville native Chevie Kehoe, convicted recently on homicide
charges;
</P>
<P>
   _Mark Thomas, Butler's former Pennsylvania state leader, who
robbed banks to fund a white revolution;
</P>
<P>
   _Nathan Thill, a skinhead and former Butler organizer in Denver,
who last November confessed to killing a man because the victim had
black skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over what people do,'' Butler says. ``I
don't espouse violence at all, but it happens. I'm not violent, but
I failed Hypocrisy 101 in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Furrow's alleged day-care assault, he says, ``I don't
favor hurting children, but I can't get worked up about the
wounding of some of my enemies, even though they're children.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he changes the subject. ``I do get worked up about
white girls being assaulted and raped'' in violent crimes by
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups that have fought Butler over the decades now
wonder about the future of his organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler, hoping to
bankrupt him in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in
Coeur d'Alene in January.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on behalf of Victoria Keenan, a Seattle
woman, and her son, Jason, who were shot at near the compound in
July 1998 by Aryan Nations security guards.
</P>
<P>
   In police reports, Keenan said the guards mistook her car's
backfire for gunfire after she stopped on the roadway and restarted
the car. The guards, according to police reports, barreled out of
the compound after her in a pickup truck, chased her two miles down
the road and shot at her car with assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County sheriff's deputies documented bullet holes in
her car. Butler's security chief, Edward ``Jesse'' Warfield,
pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced in May to as many as
five years in prison. Two other guards remain fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok of the SPLC said the group is refraining from
comments about Butler pending a trial. In the past, the SPLC has
said Butler and his group did more to foment modern racism
nationwide, and to tarnish the Northwest in the process, than any
other neo-Nazi group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews and I are at war,'' Butler says. And he believes the
lawsuit is part of that war.
</P>
<P>
   The SPLC, headed by Morris Dees in Alabama, is known for having
used civil law to break the back of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harassment. The sole purpose is to bankrupt me,''
complains Butler, who says a less well-financed Aryan Nations legal
defense fund has been set up for him. ``I've had to spend $55,000
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Keenan, Butler would say only that ``allegedly, she
was shooting at our sign out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler bought the land off Rimrock Road about 10 miles north of
Coeur d'Alene for his compound back in 1972, when he was in
California working for Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   The road winds over hills, past horse farms, fields of fresh-cut
alfalfa and creeks where kids fish, a sea of tranquility
interrupted by the jarring red, white and blue Aryan Nations sign
at the foot of Butler's property.
</P>
<P>
   Passing beneath the two flags at the entrance, one the
Confederate stars and bars, the other a 13-star U.S. flag, the
driveway climbs past a meadow of flowers until it rounds a corner,
where a ``whites only'' sign precedes an empty guardhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds resemble any of the other small retirement ranches
nearby, except for the big brown stage in the middle of the
compound, and a big Nazi swastika on a corrugated roof.
</P>
<P>
   In Butler's Aryan heyday, the compound was a popular mecca for
racist sympathizers from around the world who assailed whole groups
of people, seeking to unify neo-Nazi forces.
</P>
<P>
   A ``who's who of the hate movement'' visited the place over the
years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war
called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City
bomber Timothy McVeigh; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam; and
Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and
possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, only seven or eight people were living on or
visiting the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Butler holds court at his desk, piled with papers, in a small
office next to the church. Gifts and framed documents hang on his
office walls, including several pictures of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his desk, his 5-year-old purebred German shepherd,
Fritz, instinctively growls at strangers. Fritz follows Butler
everywhere, sometimes joining another German shepherd, Eva, roaming
the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of a sharp-featured Hitler peers across the doorway at
a softer, glowing rendition of a Jesus with European features.
There are lots of swastikas, one made by a follower in prison from
folded Camel cigarette filters; another crocheted, and another made
of folded chewing-gum wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite gifts is a line of carved ``little
Klansmen.'' Behind his chair, above a whip sent by an admirer and a
Nazi helmet, is a tot's drawing, orange silhouettes of a Klansman
pasted on yellow paper, with blue crayon scribbling.
</P>
<P>
   It was made by the daughter of Christian, his receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even teach her that,'' Christian says proudly, ``she
just did it. It was pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his idol Hitler, Butler likes kids. A school once operated
on the property but no more, though kids sometimes attend church
with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Race is a religion with Butler. The 150-year-old ideology known
as Christian Identity, which has the hallmarks of a conspiracy
theory through which he believes that he and others of white
northern European descent are the true Israelites tricked out of
their birthright by Jews, and forced to live with other races.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can understand the message of his race-based
Christian Identity religion, Butler says. White people are like
radio receivers in their ability to hear the message, says Butler.
``Jesus said let those who have ears hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Butler's more startling hypotheses: Whites, not American
Indians, were the first in the Americas. And Albert Einstein was
brilliant only because he was taught by Germans.
</P>
<P>
   He dislikes televangelists and spits out the word
``Judeo-Christian'' to describe the followers of mainstream
Christian faiths. Even followers of the World Wide Church of the
Creator, white separatists, are heretics in that they have compiled
their own Bible instead of relying on the original, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How would Butler explain his reverence for Hitler and the
swastika to those thousands of World War II veterans lying in
Normandy graveyards, who died fighting what those symbols stood
for?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of World War II soldiers now realize the war was a war
against the white race and the white race lost,'' Butler asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, born in Bennett, Colo., on Feb. 23, 1918, is proud of
his own German extraction, and says the war should never have been
fought on the European theater.
</P>
<P>
   A profile of Butler by the SPLC says his father, Clarence, a
German-English machinist, did not hide his dislike for Jews or
communists from his son. When the family moved to East Los Angeles
after the Depression, Butler studied aeronautical engineering and
science at a city college. He then got a part-time job at 25 cents
an hour at an aircraft company that sent him to Bangalore, India,
to overhaul planes for the Royal Indian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and his wife, Betty, who died in December 1995, were
married in 1941. During the war, Butler said he enlisted in the
Army Air Corps and taught aircraft hydraulics to mechnics in the
China-Burma theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he never agreed with fighting Germany, and was
invigorated by newsreels of marching Germans. His racial activism,
he said, began after returning from the war when ``things just
didn't seem right'' and he became an admirer of Sen. Joe McCarthy's
movement about communism.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's activism was galvanized during a signature campaign to
expose communist teachers, when he met William Potter Gale, a
retired Army colonel who had served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
staff, who introduced Butler to Christian Identity. Butler also met
George Lincoln Rockwell, a former Navy pilot who founded the
American Nazi Party.
</P>
<P>
   Through Gale, Butler said he met and studied under ``my
mentor,'' Dr. Wesley Swift, pastor of the Anglo-Saxon Christian
Congregation in Lancaster, Calif., whose Christian Identity
preaches that Eve mated with the devil, begetting Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Now Butler is preparing to pass the torch, but not in the
heavily mentored fashion in which he was ordained. Butler last year
appointed an heir apparent, Newman Britton, a longtime Aryan
follower from Escondido, Calif., and the latest in a string of
annointed successors who faded away over the years in philosophical
differences.
</P>
<P>
   His compound could disappear even without the lawsuit. In
January, one of Butler's two daughters, who don't share his
neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs, said she and her husband
would sell the 19-acre site, worth about $200,000, upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought the compound in 1972, Butler hoped it would be
the genesis of a white homeland, something his Christian Identity
beliefs claim white people have been denied. Even if the compound
doesn't survive, he's confident in his racist religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all pre-ordained. There's no way you can jump off of a
cliff and not proceed to the judgment that you will hit the ground.
You can't stop halfway.''
