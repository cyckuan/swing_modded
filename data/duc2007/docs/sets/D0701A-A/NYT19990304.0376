 &HT;    Neo-Nazis next target of lawyer who broke Klan
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon
sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could
carry him. A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball. Two
days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of
Macedonia Baptist Church. A skull and crossbones on the white paper
illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would torch a house of God, not even the Klan, Mouzon
thought. By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of
fire swirled from the middle of the church roof. Before sunrise,
Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American
church fires investigated in the South since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   An uneasiness prevailed. ``You were constantly looking over your
shoulder,'' said Mouzon, a shift supervisor for a security company.
</P>
<P>
   So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the
Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees
has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial
assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat,
burn and kill. He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized
hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank
account. Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations, a
white supremacist group in Idaho. On Jan. 25, the Montgomery,
Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son
who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi
members. The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the
Klan: seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, a group he said recruited throughout the
Carolinas. Eventually, leaders of the Christian Knights were
convicted of civil conspiracy _ inciting the fire that destroyed
Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By the next summer, Macedonia stood again. Tucked away in one of
South Carolina's poorest counties, the church took out a $100,000
loan, built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for
the first time in Mouzon's 13 years as pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Dees said he could win a multimillion-dollar civil judgment that
would put the South Carolina Klan out of business. Dees explained
how he had won money damages against the Klan before _ one for $7
million in Mobile, Ala., another for $1 million in Forsyth County,
Ga. He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from
Klan intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not this enormous person that you read about. He was
one of you,'' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church, its
floors covered by carpet as red as Santa's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia signed on. As he does in all his cases, Dees charged
the church nothing. Last summer, his litigators and investigators
secured a $37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of
Ku Klux Klan. Even after a court reduced the damages to $20
million, it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed
against a hate group.
</P>
<P>
   The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the
dollar for every successful civil judgment. All money realized from
settlements is given to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   What the lawsuits have done, even some Klan leaders have
conceded, is make extremist activity a bad investment, diminishing
the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups. In most of
the cases pursued by Dees, the defendants also have lost what
little property they held.
</P>
<P>
   SWAYED BY RECORD
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders, Dees told them about
Beulah Mae Donald, the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael
Donald, who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981. Then
64, the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United
Klans of America.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted neither vengeance nor money. She wanted justice for
Michael. Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan. Bank records
showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30
states. Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts
designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters
in Tuscaloosa. Former Klan members testified that UKA President
Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy trial lasted four days. An all-white jury of six
found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $7
million to Beulah Mae Donald. The UKA as a machine of hatred had
been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan of yesteryear is dead,'' Shelton said in a 1995
interview. ``Society's changing. You can't have parades with
Klansmen in robes anymore. ... The public won't go along with it.
The Klan is gone. It will never return.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald received the deed to the Klan faction's $125,000
Tuscaloosa headquarters _ the closest she ever got to the $7
million awarded by the jury. She sold the property for half its
appraised value and bought her first house. Donald died in 1988, a
year after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ASSETS UNDER ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Using civil suits, the Southern Poverty Law Center seizes
whatever assets the targeted hate group owns _ although it never
amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines. In
military terms, Dees goes after command and control centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon's church eventually may get only $200,000, if that, the
law center said, from the Christian Knights and Horace King, the
South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of
the Macedonia Baptist Church. That's only a penny on the dollar.
But it will put King on the street and, theoretically, the Klan out
of business. Hate groups are paying attention to Dees' tactics. One
white supremacist group, fearful of being sued by Dees, transferred
its assets to another organization. A federal court ruled in 1996
against the attempted evasion, and the law center now is trying to
collect an $85,000 judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 edition of the ``Florida InterKlan Report,'' a
publication ``serving the Florida Klan cartel,'' focused on Dees'
efforts in Manning. The advice: disband immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan will always be around under one name or another,''
the newsletter said. ``Don't appeal for defense funds. Close your
bank accounts. Forget about lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL LINK
</P>
<P>
   But proving organized hate isn't as easy as showing pictures of
flaming crosses to a jury. Newsletters, and Web sites stewing in
fiery rhetoric aren't enough for conviction. The convincing tie-in
comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan,
linking rhetoric to violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of King, the South Carolina grand dragon, the law
center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in
Washington. In the tape, shown to jurors, King talks about blacks
and yells, ``If we had this garbage in South Carolina, we would
burn the bastards out!''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to
burn black churches. King postponed one church fire, fearing the
Klan would be suspected.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorney, Gary White of Columbia, S.C., relied on a First
Amendment defense: Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an easy pitch to a jury,'' White said. ``It was
ugly and inflammatory, but that's what the First Amendment is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial
impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only ``a couple of
acres and a small, run-down house on it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not
the kind of thing he would just shrug off,'' Cohen said. ``That's
the kind of thing that has a lasting impact. When you're going off
to the Klan rally and you're saying goodbye to your wife, she's not
real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these
people you may lose your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactics questioned
</P>
<P>
   Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut
conspiracies costs a bundle. Dees estimates the Manning
investigation cost nearly $100,000 _ $500,000 if attorney time had
been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, it raised $102 million, according to its
federal tax filings. Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came
from more than 300,000 private contributors. During the same time,
the group spent $15 million on fund-raising _ more than 22 cents of
every dollar consumed by total expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the law center started with an endowment of $72,775.
Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission
of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the endowment topped $90 million _ $89.6 million of it
invested in equity securities. The organization's net assets
exceeded $97 million.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which
was once pastored by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the law
center will begin construction next month of a $10 million,
six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Dees drew a $205,339 salary in 1996 as the center's chief trial
counsel and chairman of its executive committee. He contributed
$19,458 to the employee benefit plan, according to the center's
1996 federal tax form.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for
South Carolina attorney general last November, helped Dees get in
touch with Macedonia Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris loves to raise money,'' said Turnipseed, a distant
relative of Dees'. ``Some of his gimmicks are just so transparent _
but they're good. He knows how to get people to give him the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent fund-raising letter, Turnipseed said, his return
envelope came with ``about six different stamps. It was like they
had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller civil rights groups, like the Center for Democratic
Renewal in Atlanta, which started as the Anti-Klan Network, wonder
why the law center needs so much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they're just sitting on it. The community doesn't
see the product,'' said Chris Freeman, a Center for Democratic
Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery
group. ``But the question is: Where are the funds going? Their
research is geared to groups like us, but there's nothing in the
com- munity.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders, who lob their
bombast in newsletters and on the Internet. Tom Metzger, head of
the White Aryan Resistance, lost a $12.5 million suit in 1990 to
Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant. He
pays $845 a month to the victim's estate. Less than affectionately,
Metzger calls his nemesis ``Morris Sleaze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due,'' Metzger
once wrote. ``He has compiled the largest direct mail financial
sucker list in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the law center's program is ``Teaching Tolerance,''
a classroom program started in 1991. A magazine that promotes
``interracial and intercultural understanding'' goes to more than
400,000 teachers. The program features books, videos and posters
costing up to $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   The law center also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights
litigation program in Georgia. The program is designed to stem
federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal
assistance to poor people in civil actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon, the Macedonia pastor, said he doesn't begrudge the law
center one cent. ``Not at all,'' he said, ``because we know
firsthand what they do. He knew we didn't have any money to accept
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY TEND TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young's
Country Mart near Manning, pallet makers from a nearby mill buy
quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter. ``Maybe a few
of them graduated from high school,'' said Jesse Young, a trustee
at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the
convenience store. One of the regulars is Romeo Haley. His brother
is Arthur, a Klansman who testified against the real big shots _
Horace King and Virgil Griffin, the main defendants in the
Macedonia fire.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders, Romeo Haley says
race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit. ``I don't
think it's changed except that people have hid themselves and run.
Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan.'' Haley said
he ``never had no use'' for the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause,''
he said. ``They're fed up with the federal government, but they'll
get scared and run in a minute. There are people who planted the
tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit, they ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the civil verdict, a healing spirit has touched Macedonia.
Mouzon plans a church picnic for his country community. Timothy
Welch, one of those convicted for setting the blaze, grew up in the
area, climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing
with church members' kids.
</P>
<P>
   Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown
to hate him. Welch's mother, Wanda, has attended recent Sunday
services. Each time, she apologized to the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need, Mouzon said. All is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move past it,'' he said. ``It comes up
occasionally. But we're trying to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   FINANCING LAWSUITS FOR THE POOR
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in
recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have
assets totaling around $100 million. But the civil rights
organization still spends most of its money on programs to help
poor people. (Figures below are in millions).
