<HEADLINE> Woman To Testify in Gingrich Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge ruled Thursday that a congressional aide  
linked romantically with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must 
testify in his divorce case. 
</P>
<P>
	Callista Bisek had tried to block the subpoena that called for  
her to be deposed by lawyers for Gingrich's wife, Marianne. 
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge found her 
arguments ``without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bisek argued that her constitutional right to privacy would  
be violated by allowing Mrs. Gingrich's attorneys ``to rummage 
through every aspect'' of her personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bisek also said she should not be required to testify about  
her relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition 
against self-incrimination, since adultery is a crime in the 
District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, separated from his wife of 18 years in May and  
filed for divorce in July. Since then, lawyers for Mrs. Gingrich 
have attempted to probe his finances, business dealings and his 
relationship with Ms. Bisek. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the former Speaker released a temporary financial  
agreement he and his wife signed last month that pays each about 
$10,000 a month. The agreement gives Mrs. Gingrich the couple's 
house in Marietta, Ga., and Gingrich their Washington apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial agreement was submitted as part of a motion  
Gingrich filed a day earlier asking a judge to force his wife to 
turn over money he says she's hoarding.
