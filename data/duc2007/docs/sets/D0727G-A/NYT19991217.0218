 &HT;    Gingriches reach settlement, avoid
 &HT;    high-profile trial

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys for former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and his soon-to-be ex-wife expect a judge to approve the couple's
divorce within a month.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a
settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report
Friday, saying the couple came to a ``full settlement'' early that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal
standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial.
The couple have agreed to keep the terms of the agreement
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very intense negotiation,'' said Gingrich's business attorney,
Randy Evans. ``I think both parties worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement closes five months of bitter legal wrangling in
the case, culminating with Gingrich's admission last month that
he's had a romantic relationship with a Washington congressional
aide for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh attention to his private life had begun to affect
Gingrich's standing as one of the national Republican's primary
ideologists and fund-raisers. Several GOP members of Congress had
raised objections to Gingrich's attendance at ceremonies in
Washington this fall marking the fifth anniversary of the
Republican takeover of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 56, resigned as speaker just over a year ago, after
severe losses in the November 1998 elections. He maintains that his
affair with 33-year-old Callista Bisek, a scheduler and secretary
for the House Agriculture Committee, was not a factor in his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawyers in the case wouldn't say so, divorce lawyers
across the country speculated that Gingrich's future earnings were
probably a major issue in the discussions. While his finances were
limited as a leader of Congress, as a private citizen Gingrich had
begun to snag speaking fees and corporate positions. Gingrich is
now a political commentator for Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday's mediation, Gingrich said he was willing to
pay his wife alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement lays out how the Gingriches will split their
property, money and other assets. It came during a grueling
court-ordered mediation session which began at 1:30 p.m. Thursday
and ended exactly 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches, who hadn't seen each other in person since June,
spent much of the session in separate rooms at the Cobb County law
offices of John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney. The couple
communicated through their $100-an-hour mediator, who was selected
by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers wouldn't say whether the couple met face-to-face,
but the Gingriches could be seen briefly mingling in the hall once
or twice. At one point, the couple's lawyers left the Gingriches
alone and took a walk.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the deal, the Gingriches and their attorneys
boarded an elevator together for the trip 22 floors down to the
parking lot. Gingrich shooed away several television cameramen that
tried to get on with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's over,'' he said, declining to comment about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, her eyes bloodshot, said she was exhausted.
When asked if she was happy with the settlement, the 48-year-old
Ohio native would say only, ``It's been a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue answered the same question with raised eyebrows and an
affirmative nod, although his words were more diplomatic: ``It's
fair to everybody. We're pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Mayoue summed up his feelings this way: ``It's not
exhilaration. It's more a sense that this fight, that Marianne
never wanted, is being put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Newt Gingrich who filed for divorce July 29, although
Marianne Gingrich subsequently asked for a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C., judge had also granted her the right to
question Bisek under oath; that will not take place now.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said the
divorce settlement will likely make it easier for Gingrich to
return to the public eye in a political setting.
</P>
<P>
   Clay said there are no plans for Gingrich to get involved with
the state GOP, but that the party won't shut him out if he wants to
lend his influence. ``Are there places that I could see utilizing
Newt Gingrich in some capacity? Yes,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Clay was pleased to hear Gingrich's divorce
was over. ``It's always both a relief and it's certainly the
beginning of a healing process, to settle a case rather than drag
it out in a public forum.''
