 &HT;    Divorce mediator meets with Gingriches today

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich will try to reach
a divorce settlement today in their first face-to-face meeting
since theirsplit.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is scheduled to appear for a court-ordered mediation
session in Cobb County, Ga. The meeting will be held at the offices
of Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement today may be a lot to ask, however.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has yet to question under oath her estranged
husband's admitted girlfriend, Callista Bisek. Marianne Gingrich
and Mayoue have considered the deposition a key element of their
case. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich
has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Washington judge ordered Bisek to answer questions
under oath for Marianne Gingrich and provide documents related to
her affair with Gingrich. The documents include cards, phone
records and bank statements dating back to 1995, when Newt Gingrich
became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Gingrich and
Bisek, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, have
admitted they've been seeing each other for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has begun turning over the documents to Marianne Gingrich,
but the two sides have been unable to agree on a deposition date.
It's uncertain now whether Bisek's deposition will be taken at all
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he needs time to examine Bisek's documents, although
he originally demanded only that Bisek bring the documents to the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue has not returned phone messages left at his office for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said this week that Gingrich is prepared to split the
couple's marital assets and pay his wife alimony. He said he wasn't
sure whether a settlement could actually be reached today, but he
said Gingrich is going into the mediation with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   A standing judicial order in Cobb Superior Court requires all
civil cases to be taken to mediation before they can be granted a
trial date. The Gingriches elected to use a mediator chosen by the
court's Alternative Dispute Resolution division, so there would be
no complaints later about how a mediator was selected.
</P>
<P>
   After today's session, the mediator will report to the court
whether the Gingriches have hit an impasse, reached a settlement or
made progress toward a divorce agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Said Evans: ``I would be surprised if the judge didn't order at
least one more mediation session before it goes to trial.''
