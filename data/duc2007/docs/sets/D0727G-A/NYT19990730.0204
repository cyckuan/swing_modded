   Washington _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed for
divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is
``irretrievably broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed papers Thursday in the Superior Court of Cobb
County, Ga., stating that he and Marianne Gingrich have been
separated since May 10th and are working on a divorce agreement
that would ``resolve all matters and controversies between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers, filed by Gingrich's personal attorney J. Randolph
Evans, stated little else other than Gingrich has reserved his
right to ``set forth additional grounds for divorce'' if the
parties can not reach an amicable conclusion to the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A hint that the divorce was not desired by both Gingriches came
by way of a one-sentence statement from Marianne Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne is saddened and disappointed at Newt's decision,''
said Victoria Toensing, her personal attorney based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is Gingrich's second marriage. He divorced his first wife,
Jackie, two years after his 1978 election to Congress. Attempts to
reach the former speaker were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the couple say there have been problems in the
marriage dating back to Gingrich's unexpected resignation as
speaker of the House last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is best known leading the Republican Party's takeover
of the House in 1994. During that so-called Republican Revolution,
Gingrich emphasized that ``family values'' should be a core pillar
in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Georgia and Washington expressed sorrow, suggesting
that the years in the spotlight might have been the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, but it's a fact of life and a high price to pay
(for being in public life),'' said Rich Galen, a longtime aide to
Gingrich in Washington. ``The stresses of public life that
occasionally become overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am heartbroken that this has happened,'' said former Georgia
State Rep. Matt Towery, a former campaign manager who has known
both Gingriches for two decades. ``All I hope is that they will be
able to resolve and end this relationship with the degree of
privacy and discretion of anyone who is in private life.''
