<HEADLINE> Gingrich Wants Money From Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is  
asking a judge to force his estranged wife to turn over money he 
says she is hoarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in  
Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced 
to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days. It 
threatens a contempt action if she refuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple agreed last month to set up the joint account and  
transfer assets into it until their divorce is final. Evans said he 
believes Mrs. Gingrich still owes the account tens of thousands of 
dollars. Gingrich has turned over about $35,000, while Mrs. 
Gingrich has turned over only several thousand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, has denied the  
allegations. Harvey Cohen, the accountant hired to manage the joint 
account, said he was not aware of any improprieties by either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's motion was one of a series filed by Gingrich this  
week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has 
sought to force him to face formal questioning about his personal 
and financial affairs. Mrs. Gingrich also wants to question 
Callista Bisek, a congressional aide to whom Gingrich has been 
romantically linked. 
</P>

	Gingrich separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed  
for divorce in July.
