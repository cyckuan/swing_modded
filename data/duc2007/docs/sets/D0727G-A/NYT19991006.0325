 &HT;    Joint account latest duel item in Gingrich divorce
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

   ATLANTA _ As promised, Newt Gingrich kept the pressure on his
estranged wife Wednesday by asking a judge to force her to turn
over money he says she's hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked
a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to
a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their
divorce is final. The motion threatens a contempt action if
Marianne Gingrich continues to stall.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich still
owes the joint account tens of thousands of dollars, by his
estimation. So far she has deposited only several thousand, Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has signed a sworn statement saying his wife
controls most of their money, has turned over about $35,000 he has
been paid for sitting on several boards.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, could not be reached
for comment Wednesday, but he has previously denied the
allegations. The CPA managing the account for the Gingriches said
both sides have acted in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's motion was among several filed by Gingrich this week
in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has
aggressively sought to question him about personal and financial
matters outside their marriage. Marianne Gingrich also wants to
depose Callista Bisek, a congressional aide with whom the former
U.S. House speaker has a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Gingrich's new attack stance will continue through
the week. Coming motions will probe financial aspects of the
divorce case. Next week, Gingrich's motions will focus on what part
Marianne Gingrich played in the breakdown of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a most enlightening week,'' Evans predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's latest motion centers on a Sept. 10 agreement he and
his wife signed that was supposed to temporarily resolve monetary
issues between the divorcing couple. Marianne Gingrich had accused
her husband of attempting to transfer money before filing his July
29 divorce petition. Gingrich had responded by saying his wife
depleted a substantial portion of the accounts she controlled.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ensuing agreement, ``All existing amounts as
well as any accumulated compensation earned since the parties'
separation, irrespective of location, in any account of any kind
... shall be transferred immediately into the account.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's motion accuses Marianne Gingrich of waiting 20 days
to begin transferring her portion of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the CPA managing the joint account, says some of
Gingrich's speech money is still tied up in a business he and his
wife own together. Cohen expects to get that money once the
necessary transfer paperwork is completed.
