 &HT;    Settlement of Gingrich divorce may hinge on lover's deposition
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's estranged wife hopes today will
resolve a months-long quest for answers from her husband's lover.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge is set to
hear arguments this morning about what gifts, records and other
documents Gingrich's girlfriend, Callista Bisek, must turn over in
his Cobb County, Ga., divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the records requested by Gingrich's wife, Marianne, date
back to January 1995, when Gingrich was sworn in a speaker of the
U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge also must decide how soon Bisek, a Virginia resident and
scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, will have to sit for
questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney. They have asked that a
deposition be held within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich says she'll attend the hearing. Efforts to
contact Bisek and her attorney have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing is significant because Marianne Gingrich, 48,
and her attorney appear intent on taking Bisek's deposition before
they will talk settlement. The Bisek deposition is among several
disputes that have marked the contentious case since the
twice-married Newt Gingrich filed for divorce in July. Gingrich and
Marianne have been married 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek, a scheduler for the Agriculture Committee, has already
testified under oath for Gingrich's attorneys that her affair with
the former Georgia congressman began six years ago. Attorneys for
Gingrich, 56, also have admitted that he had an ``intimate
relationship'' with Bisek, 33.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bisek still refuses to answer Marianne Gingrich's
questions under oath or respond to certain document requests. Both
areas could contain evidence that might be used during a divorce
trial or to leverage a more favorable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has argued that many of Marianne Gingrich's questions are
either too broad or vague. Bisek has also expressed concerns that
some of the questions infringe upon her constitutional right not to
incriminate herself. Adultery is a crime in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hedge ordered lawyers for the Gingriches to try to
reach a compromise on the subpoena. While they agreed on certain
items, they reached an impasse on others.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has agreed to reveal several gifts Gingrich gave her,
including a pearl ring and a set of Callaway Golf clubs. Bisek also
is prepared to reveal money Gingrich has spent on her, or trips
she's taken at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   There's much more Bisek still refuses to turn over, including
phone records for the past five years, correspondence between her
and Gingrich, as well as photos, videotapes or audiotapes of them
together.
