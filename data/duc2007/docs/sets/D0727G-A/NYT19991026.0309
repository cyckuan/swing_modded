 &HT;    Gingrich lawyer to question aide
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his
own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice filed Tuesday in Cobb County Superior Court,
Gingrich announced he will question Callista Bisek under oath Nov.
9. The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife
Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together
since the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives filed
for divorce in July.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which an opposing attorney called ``unique,'' comes
weeks into an unresolved legal contest between Bisek and Marianne
Gingrich over the same deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's
subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with
the former speaker. The subpoena also asks for documents, such as
letters, phone records and gift receipts, that could link the two
romantically. The judge's ruling is expected any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea of us hiding the ball, I want to get rid of
that real quick,'' Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Tuesday.
``We're not hiding anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, characterized
Gingrich's deposition notice as ``peculiar'' and pointed out that
Bisek has not withdrawn her objections to Mayoue's request for a
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   While Bisek could conceivably object to questioning by
Gingrich's attorneys, Evans said she has agreed to participate. In
fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in
Washington, according to Tuesday's filing. Bisek's attorney, Pamela
Bresnahan, did not return a phone message seeking confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's notice also instructs Bisek to bring with her records
of any money he has spent on her, gifts he's purchased for her, and
travel she's taken at his expense since he became speaker. They are
all documents Bisek already has agreed to turn over in the
deposition dispute between her and Marianne Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   According to divorce experts, Gingrich wants to make it clear to
the public and to the court that Bisek is an independent witness
who is not under his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to show the court that they are not trying to
hide her,'' Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than as a public relations tool, Gingrich's move to depose
Bisek offers little tactical benefit, Edlin said. In a deposition,
both sides are allowed to question the witness.
</P>
<P>
   While Evans has scheduled Bisek's deposition for Nov. 9, his
notice left open the possibility that a new date could be
negotiated. On Nov. 11, the Gingriches are due to appear before
Judge Dorothy Robinson in Cobb Superior Court as their lawyers
argue several discovery motions still in contention. Both sides say
they intend to follow through with the hearing. Said Evans: ``We
want to get this case resolved or tried.''
