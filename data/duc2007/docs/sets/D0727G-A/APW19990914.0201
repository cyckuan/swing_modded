<HEADLINE> Report: Gingrich's Have Divorce Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an  
agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of 
their divorce proceedings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The confidential agreement on who owns what between Gingrich and  
his wife, Marianne, was reached Monday and ``gives them both 
support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, told the newspaper that  
an agreement was reached, but would give no details. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was  
expected to attract national media, especially after the disclosure 
of Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, 
Callista Bisek of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year  
marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made 
against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing Gingrich of  
trying to transfer assets before the divorce filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich, 56, said in a separate filing that Mrs. Gingrich held  
all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated. He 
further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Gingrich's office and Mrs. Gingrich's house went  
unanswered late Monday.
