 &HT;    Gingriches go to court
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   Newt Gingrich's divorce moves to a courtroom for the first time
today as lawyers argue whether 32 questions is really just 32
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Gingrich say he will skip today's hearing. His
estranged wife, Marianne, plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has asked Judge Dorothy Robinson to force
Gingrich to answer pages of questions designed to uncover evidence
that can be used at trial. Most of the questions concern the former
U.S. House speaker's finances and his admitted affair with Callista
Bisek, 33, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich contends his wife's multiple-part questions actually
amount to as many as 150 questions. Georgia law allows just
one-third that many, so Gingrich wants his wife to pare them down.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious divorce has been full of unusual turns,
including Gingrich's deposition Tuesday in Virginia of Bisek, who
admitted the two have carried on a six-year affair. Such moves have
left divorce attorneys outside the case shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bisek has refused to answer a Washington subpoena
that requires her to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's
attorney. The subpoena also requires Bisek to produce gifts and
other documents that evidence her affair with Gingrich. A
Washington judge will decide that dispute after a Nov. 23 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce in July, just days before the
couple's 18th wedding anniversary. Months earlier, Gingrich had
called his wife at her childhood home in Ohio to say he wanted out
of the marriage and that he was having an affair with Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Marianne Gingrich has said of that day. ``I
had no idea about any of it.''
