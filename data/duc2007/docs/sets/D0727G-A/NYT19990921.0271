 &HT;    Marianne Gingrich's attorney asks for depositions of estranged
husbands' friends
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's closest associate could become part of
his divorce case as Marianne Gingrich attempts to drag out and nail
down any personal and financial secrets her estranged husband is
keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney has asked a Cobb County judge for permission to
depose Joe Gaylord, whom Gingrich once described as an advisor ``on
all aspects of my life and career'' and one of his ``closest
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord has worked closely with Gingrich and his campaigns since
the early 1980s, and he served for a time as executive director of
GOPAC. Newt Gingrich used the powerful political action committee
to train Republican candidates for Congress in his long effort to
win a GOP majority in the U.S. House, and he credits Gaylord for
helping him do it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to motions released Tuesday, Marianne Gingrich's
attorney, John Mayoue, also wants to take a deposition from unnamed
representatives of GOPAC and the Friends of Newt Gingrich campaign
committee, for which Gaylord also worked.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth request among those filed late Monday asks to depose an
unnamed representative from Private Enterprise Partners in
Washington. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said he knows
only that Private Enterprise Partners was an entity set up by
Gaylord.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord was reached at a Washington number for Private
Enterprise Partners on Tuesday, but declined to comment on the
request for his depositions. He also declined to say what the
company's purpose is. ``I'm not a part of this story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue won't comment on the organization either, and he won't
say what information he hopes to learn from the depositions. Mayoue
needs Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson's permission to take
the depositions because the subjects live out of state, in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best guess is they're just trying to pin down the finance
pieces,'' said Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Gingriches have decided how to temporarily split
their assets until their contentious divorce is final, lawyers for
both sides have been freed up to concentrate on the next phase of
the case _ discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Ain, a Washington, D.C.-based divorce lawyer who makes a
specialty of representing high-profile politicians, said
depositions are particularly useful in the information-gathering
phase of a divorce case, especially when it comes to assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really trying to find out is how much money and
where it is,'' Ain said.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions also allow lawyers to confirm information they
already have, and force witnesses to commit to testimony they would
give at trial. Tactically, the threat of a deposition can increase
``pressure to come to a settlement,'' Ain added.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has already won permission to take at least
one deposition that could help pressure a settlement. On Sept. 29,
33-year-old congressional aid Callista Bisek is scheduled to answer
questions under oath about her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
