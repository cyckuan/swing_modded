 &HT;    Gingrich wraps up his official duties

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in the mid-1980s, well before he was House
speaker, Newt Gingrich used to take long walks around the National
Mall, the great public square that ties together all of
Washington's grand monuments. The walks, which became less frequent
with his rise to power, helped relieve bouts of early morning
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never get further than the Washington Monument without
becoming an optimist,'' Gingrich said last week. ``I would argue to
anybody in this city, if you just get out and walk down the Mall
you would be a healthier human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich left his office twice to walk the Mall, once
with a close aide and once with his wife, Marianne. The walks, he
said, were dedicated to thinking about ``the future, thinking about
how I'm going to organize my life for the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, is already moving on. He remains on the job until
the new Congress formally elects a new speaker Jan. 6. But Gingrich
already has become speaker in name only. This past week, beginning
with his return to Washington after the Nov. 3 elections and ending
with an address to new members, was effectively his last in power.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's power began slipping the instant he announced 10 days
ago that he would not stand for re-election as speaker and would
resign the House seat he has held since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gingrich arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday to a
bittersweet welcome party organized by staff, House Republicans
already had shifted their allegiance to Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-La.), the lanky chairman of the House Appropriations Committee
who will be named speaker by his colleagues on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members proclaimed their affection with posters saying,
``I love Newt.'' Across America, the post-election issue of
Newsweek hit newsstands, featuring a vaguely anguished close-up of
Gingrich and captioned simply, ``The Loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which power shifts in Washington is both
breathtaking and cruel. In Livingston's office adjacent to the
Capitol, it was standing room only as reporters, lobbyists and
staff competed to get Livingston's attention. Members trying to
reach Livingston by phone got constant busy signals and were forced
to walk to his office to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston emerged from a meeting with Gingrich Tuesday
afternoon, noting there were ``just a jillion tasks, a jillion
things to do.'' In contrast, Gingrich's office was quiet most of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries to Gingrich's press office, which typically average
100 to 150 calls a day, dropped to fewer than 30. There were no
events to plan, no agenda to set. Gingrich himself was busy
planning his private, not public, life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the reality of this town,'' said Robert Walker, a former
House member from Pennsylvania and a close friend of Gingrich's.
``This town flows toward power.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategy for a new life
</P>
<P>
   For Gingrich, the emotional high of last week may have been
Monday night when he addressed the biggest contributors of GOPAC,
the political action committee he once led and the vehicle of his
accession to power. The ovations were frequent and thunderous, even
though the remarks themselves were little changed from his stock
campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich seemed as if a ``great burden had been lifted from his
shoulders,'' said Matt Glavin, director of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation in Atlanta, who spoke to Gingrich the night he announced
that he would not run for speaker and who was present at the Monday
dinner speech.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment of the evening came not from what Gingrich
said, but from what he did. Before the speech, he embraced
Livingston warmly, conferring his blessing on the next speaker for
all to see.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, Gingrich's staff member were already adjusting to
their new roles. Gingrich himself set the tone, coming in to work
after lunch with Marianne and daughters Jackie Sue Cushman and
Kathy Gingrich-Lubbers at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a Washington
institution near the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich padded around his office, appearing unhurried and
relaxed. Midafternoon he bumped into Casey Weldon, the third-string
quarterback for the Washington Redskins, who was getting a tour of
the Capitol. The Redskins, 1-8 for the season, are having their
most disastrous year of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to hang in there, that it's been a rough year for
all of us,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gingrich met with Livingston for more than an hour, the
first formal meeting between the two men since Livingston announced
he would run for speaker the Friday after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just couldn't be more gracious and helpful,'' Livingston
said. Gingrich was already ``strategizing his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich doesn't think small thoughts,'' Livingston said.
``He thinks large and wide. He's an incredibly gifted person.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne popped in and out of Gingrich's office all day Tuesday,
appearing positively serene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes occur,'' she said. ``You say, `OK, what next?' We
weren't expecting this, but now this is an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who Gingrich once hoped would be his majority whip
instead of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), ate dinner with the Gingriches
Wednesday night at the Capital Grille, another Washington
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never known him to be happier, and I certainly have
never known Marianne to be happier,'' Walker said. ``This is going
to give them an opportunity to plan their lives together in ways
that are going to be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich hasn't said specifically what he will do when
he leaves office, Walker and others are betting that he will take
his place on the lucrative lecture circuit. The occupation will
continue to give Gingrich visibility, and allow him to discuss
ideas without the chore of trying to translate them into
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be one of the hottest names on the lecture circuit for
some time to come,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   King of a different hill
</P>
<P>
   Mel Steely, an old buddy of Gingrich's from West Georgia
College, dropped in to see the speaker last week and also wasn't
surprised to find Gingrich in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still king of the hill, it's just a different hill,''
Steely said. ``In Newt's mind, he's always king of the hill. That's
what you guys don't understand about him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gingrich received some retirement advice from
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be around a while,'' Dole said, leaving Gingrich's
office. ``At 55, he's got a lot ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich wasn't getting much attention inside the Capitol
last week, outside the building was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   When he took his late afternoon walk around the Mall Wednesday
with Steve Wesbrook, his operations manager, Gingrich was
recognized by virtually everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Striding past the National Gallery of Art, Gingrich shook the
outstretched hand of a tourist who said, ``Nice to see you, Mr.
Speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of Gingrich's earshot, an associate of the tourist turned to
his walking partner and said, ``Nice to see you? Nice to see you
go!''
</P>
<P>
   More typical was the response of Joe Domenico, who wanted his
picture taken with Gingrich. ``Thank you for everything,'' Domenico
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln Memorial, Gingrich was nearly tackled by a
breathless student from the University of Maryland who said she was
studying Gingrich in college. Holding a copy of ``To Renew
America,'' Gingrich's 1995 book, the woman begged Gingrich to sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a library book,'' Gingrich exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know,'' said Rebekah Mayer. ``I'm going to buy it
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Rebekah, you have to buy this book,'' Gingrich said after
signing it. ``I don't want to hear later that you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich walked the Mall again Thursday, this time with
Marianne. Holding hands, fewer people seemed to notice the speaker,
who was dressed in black slacks, white shoes and brown leather
jacket. ``Good luck, Newt!'' shouted a man from a passing car, his
fist clenched.
</P>
<P>
   Before he returned to Georgia on Friday, Gingrich performed
perhaps his most meaningful official duty of the week, giving the
opening greeting to the 40 newly elected members of the House at
freshmen orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the official welcome, Gingrich breakfasted with the
freshmen members in the ``family room,'' a large wood-paneled room
just off the House floor reserved for members and their guests.
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast, Gingrich told the new members that service in
the House was a strain on home life, and he urged them to make a
special effort to spend time with their families. He told them that
House service was an honor, but that they should also have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois state Rep. Judy Biggert, a Republican elected from the
Chicago suburbs, recalled how Gingrich had come to her district
before the election and energized her supporters ``by what he had
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's remarks Friday were inspirational, Biggert said, but
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of bittersweet,'' she said as she hurried into her
first orientation meeting. ``I think he will be really missed.
