 &HT;    Gingriches kept apart as divorce mediation begins

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich spent Thursday
afternoon with a mediator in their first attempt to resolve their
bitter divorce.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether they were making any real progress.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the first two hours of the court-ordered session,
the Gingriches remained in separate rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each party is in a conference room, and the mediator goes back
and forth between each group,'' said Tom Browning, Newt Gingrich's
divorce attorney. ``I call it Henry Kissinger shuttle diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Browning said mediation generally includes a face-to-face
meeting at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the split would be settled Thursday, Browning said he
was hopeful: ``You know, it's to their benefit. Those who are able
to settle their cases are going to save a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, also offered few
hints about the mediation, which was being conducted in his law
offices near Cumberland Mall in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily complex and difficult case. It's
fraught with a lot of emotions,'' Mayoue said. ``We're using our
best efforts today to get this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediation is required of most civil cases in Cobb County
Superior Court, where Gingrich filed for divorce in July. The
couple has been married 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans, said the former
U.S. House speaker is ready to split all current assets with his
wife and pay her alimony. Marianne Gingrich hasn't said what her
terms for settlement would be. But she has been adamant about
deposing Callista Bisek, the House employee with whom Gingrich has
had a relationship for six years. That deposition probably will be
put off until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich divorce so far has included a number of smaller
fights over money, information and the testimony of Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   The couple nearly went to court over a joint account set up to
protect their assets while the divorce is being sought. Much of the
money was earned this year, after Gingrich left Congress in
January. That dispute settled on whether Marianne Gingrich had
deposited all the funds from a joint company the couple had set up
this year before their split.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, Marianne Gingrich took her husband's lawyers to a
Cobb County courtroom and successfully asked a judge to order him
to answer 32 questions intended to dig up evidence about finances
and infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, Marianne Gingrich again went to court, this time in
Washington. There, a judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under
oath and provide records that might document her relationship with
Gingrich.
