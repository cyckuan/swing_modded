	   LAS NUEVAS CLARITAS, Venezuela (AP) _ ``Guarico'' is lounging in
a hammock near gigantic Amazonian gold deposits where he has spent
11 years searching for his jackpot.
	   But far from counting his riches, he's ticking off the days
before he quits this one-time boom town that's going bust.
	   ``I'm not doing anything. I've been defeated,'' says the
25-year-old gold hunter.
	   The Amazon rain forests of eastern Venezuela used to be a place
where a poor man with a pick and shovel could strike it rich _ or
at least dream of it.
	   But now the government is chasing illegal miners off some of the
best land to make way for international companies that have
concessions to mine for gold.
	   That has environmentalists worried that miners are moving to
untapped lands where they will leave more paths of destruction.
	   The miners ``may cause even worse damage if they aren't located
in areas where they can be controlled,'' said Jorge Padron, head of
the National Ecological and Social Union.
	   Thousands of miners flooded into the Imataca rain forest in the
1980s. They searched for gold that over the centuries has attracted
explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh, who sought the legendary golden
city of ``El Dorado.''
	   In Imataca they built a frontier town called Las Claritas on top
of what is believed to be the richest gold deposit in Latin
America. The town grew to 10,000 people, including entire families.
They came from as far as Colombia, Brazil and the Dominican
Republic and built houses out of plastic sheets and wooden poles.
	   Each day they dug out rocks, put them into sacks and trudged to
a mill where gold was separated from dirt. Everyone had good days
and bad. Yet during the boom, miners earned as much as dlrs 5,000 a
month at a time when the average worker in Venezuela made about
dlrs 200.
	   At the center of Las Claritas they erected a statue of a miner
with a pick in his hand and a dog at his side. In their minds they
were pioneers, like the men and women who conquered the Wild West
in the United States.
	   But ecologists said the miners destroyed the environment with
mercury and high-pressure water hoses used to uproot trees.
Government officials complained it was impossible to collect taxes
or control the miners, whose village was rife with drugs, violence
and prostitution.
	   Several years ago, authorities forced Las Claritas' residents to
relocate a few miles (kilometers) away. The new town _ Las Nuevas
Claritas _ prospered at first. But then the government sold rights
to the prized mining site to Canada's Placer Dome and other mining
companies.
	   Today, Las Nuevas Claritas is fading. It used to boast a couple
dozen ore mills. Now there are two.
	   One of them, where Guarico works, used to operate 24 hours a
day. Now it cranks up no more than six hours. The amount of gold
sacks processed is down from 600 a day to 50. The town's population
has dwindled to 3,000.
	   Falling international gold prices have contributed to the hard
times.
	   ``Before it was a situation of bonanza. There was lots of gold
and it was easy,'' said miner Juan Tremeria. ``Now we have a
situation where people are going hungry.''
	   Few miners have fortunes stashed away from gold's heyday.
	   Most blew their money on alcohol, prostitutes and wild parties
in the remote jungle village, where goods were expensive. The gold
diggers, like the rest of Venezuela that was experiencing an oil
boom, neglected to save for a rainy day.
	   Nowadays, a miner is lucky if he makes dlrs 400- dlrs 500 a
month.
	   Officials say bringing in dozens of companies to the mining
areas will provide thousands of jobs and decrease ecological
damage. The companies use sophisticated technology and will run
programs to teach illegal miners better techniques, they argue.
	   Environmentalists contend the companies will overwhelm the
forest. And they question the government's claims about jobs and
training programs.
	   Some miners are already heading to new sites not sold to the
mining companies, such as the fragile areas around the river
headwaters that feed the Guri Dam, one of the world's largest
hydroelectric plants.
	   Padron and other environmentalists charge that National
Guardsmen are collecting bribes from illegal miners to allow them
to operate in the new areas. Officials don't deny the allegation
and say they are working to curb corruption.
	   The invasion of new territories may leave another ``disaster in
the middle of the pristine forest,'' said Clemencia Rodner of the
Audubon Society.
