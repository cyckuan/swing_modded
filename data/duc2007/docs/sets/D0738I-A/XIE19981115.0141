<HEADLINE> Venezuela Expects Drastic Rise in Gold Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's gold production is
expected to grow rapidly in the next few years thanks to massive
investment growth by national and foreign private investors, the
Energy and Mines Ministry said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is expected to attract between 1999 and 2003 4.4
billion U.S. dollars in private capital to boost the mining of
gold, coal, iron, nickel and bauxite.
</P>
<P>
To encourage investment, the government plans, among other
incentives, to cut the current minimum income tax rate of 34
percent by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated that out of the 4.4 billion-dollar
investment, 2.04 billion dollars, which will mainly take the form
of strategic associations with foreign companies, will be used to
raise the country's annual gold output to more than 33 tons after
the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's gold output varies between 1.0 and 1.2 tons a
year. Its gold ore reserves are estimated at 10,000 to 12,000
tons, representing 10 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela boasts approximately 3 million hectares of land with
gold prospection potentials, of which about 1.5 million hectares
have already been assigned.
