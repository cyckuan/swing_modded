<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Peru will rank seventh largest gold
producer this year, an official from the Mining, Oil and Energy
National Society said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peru's gold output will amount to 140 tons this year, up ten
tons compared with that of last year, said Guillermo Albareda.
</P>
<P>
The output could sharply grow in a not too long period if the
great potential of many gold projects under construction are taken
into account, he added.
</P>
<P>
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350
million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
</P>
<P>
"We are working in long-term investments as hard as we have
worked during the last ten years," said Carlos Galvez, president
of the Gold Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura
company.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the exports of gold earned Peru about 1.2 billion
dollars.
