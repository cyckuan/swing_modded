BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Thai Chamber of
Commerce will meet Peru's gold industry leaders to discuss
possible joint ventures to mine Peruvian gold, the Bangkok post
reported today.

Patima Srichoomsiri, director of the Chamber's committee on
small and medium-sized enterprises, will visit the Peruvian
capital Lima at the head of a delegation next week and attend
Peru's Second International Gold Symposium there.

A press release from the Peruvian Embassy in Bangkok said the
gold mining industry has grown by leaps and bounds in recent
years, prompting Peru's National Mining and Petroleum Society to
organize the first international gold symposium in 1994. That
meeting drew more than 800 participants.

Next week's symposium will highlight the current state of gold
resources in the country and promote new investment in the
industry.
