	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Refugees from Guatemala's civil war  
returned to their homeland from Mexico on Thursday, marking the 
final chapter of an international effort to resettle them. 
</P>
<P>
	United Nations officials called the return of 294 Guatemalans a  
successful example of resettlement efforts. With Thursday's return, 
a total of 41,633 Guatemalans have been helped home. 
</P>
<P>
	About 13,000 Guatemalan refugees remain in 60 camps in the  
southern Mexican state Chiapas. They will either return 
individually or stay in Mexico under a nationalization program 
offered by that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees were welcomed with religious services and music  
Thursday in the town square of Coatepeque, 125 miles west of 
Guatemala. They are the last group to be resettled under a 
U.N.-supervised program in which the Guatemalan government offered 
them low-interest loans to buy farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fled to Mexico and the United  
States beginning in 1981 amid violence from the country's civil 
war.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Striking bus drivers blocked streets and  
many businesses closed their doors Thursday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
largest city, in a one-day strike against the government's economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the businesses in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest  
of Quito, closed to protest President Jamil Mahuad's proposal to 
raise taxes to reduce the small South American nation's $1.2 
billion budget deficit. Bus drivers blocked roads with their 
vehicles to protest the planned gasoline price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal workers demanding a greater share of the nation's  
budget for cities also joined the strike, placing city trucks and 
construction equipment across roads to strengthen the blockades. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was largely peaceful. Guayaquil police reported  
arresting 25 striking drivers for causing disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight months in office, Mahuad has faced two national strikes  
and repeated street protests as he tries to reform Ecuador's 
bankrupt economy and drag it from its worst economic crisis in 
decades.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaraguan troops surrounded Managua's  
Sandino International Airport on Thursday to stop reported plans by 
student protesters to seize the facility and press their demands 
for higher funding for public universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came one day after a 21-year-old law student killed by  
a rubber bullet fired by police Tuesday was buried in an emotional 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials have warned protesters they might begin using  
regular ammunition if demonstrators continue to attack public 
buildings and police lines with rocks and mortars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students backed by the leftist Sandinista party have been  
demonstrating for three weeks to demand that the center-right 
government of Arnoldo Aleman increase budgets for universities. The 
students barricaded access roads to the airport Tuesday and some 
said they planned to seize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police officers and students have been injured in the  
clashes, and 70 protesters have been arrested since the 
disturbances began.

	CHILANGUERA, El Salvador (AP) -- U.S. army reserve members  
started work Thursday on a joint project with the Salvadoran army 
to rebuild bridges and public facilities destroyed by Hurricane 
Mitch in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The 350 reservists -- mainly from the 81st regional support  
command based in Birmingham, Ala., but including reserve members 
from 15 other states -- will work for the next four months 
rebuilding highways, bridges, roads, schools and health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in this hamlet 100 miles southeast of San  
Salvador, U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson said the projects are 
aimed at ``preventing another disaster like the one that occurred 
during the recent hurricane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people in Central America  
and caused billions of dollar in damage in October and November.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Indians clad in loincloths and smeared  
with warpaint on Thursday protested President Hugo Chavez's failure 
to halt gold mining in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former coup leader who took office in February,  
promised during his campaign to reverse a 1997 decree that 
legalized gold and diamond mining in the pristine Imataca rain 
forest in southeast Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez  
has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the 
site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 Indians protested outside Congress Thursday, including  
two Yanomamis who walked into Congress to present legislators with 
a letter outlining their complaints. The Yanomamis are one of the 
last Stone Age tribes on earth, though their culture has been hurt 
in recent years by contact with modernity.
