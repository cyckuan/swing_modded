<HEADLINE> Peru's Gold Industry Seeks Thai Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Peru, with its resurgent gold
industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to
develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries,
according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Peru will sharpen its promotional focus among Thai investors
during the Second International Gold Symposium in Lima from May
7-10, Maurtua was quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will cover all aspects of gold mining, financing
and technological processes. It will be an ideal forum for Thai
investors to find out the strong potential Peru offers, he said.
</P>
<P>
With abundant supplies of gold in Peru, Thai manufacturers
could set up joint ventures there to produce jewelry, Maurtua
said.
</P>
<P>
Thais would find even greater opportunities in gold mining,
which has proved to be very profitable in recent years, and the
recent conclusion of a bilateral agreement for protection of
investments gave Thai investors another strong incentive to look
at Peru, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay
Viravan during his visit to Peru in January.
