   WASHINGTON _ Jerry Jones, the flamboyant Dallas Cowboys owner
best known in the rough and tumble worlds of sports and business,
made a foray into the intellectual world on Wednesday with a $1
million gift to honor Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his wife, Gene, gave the money to the Library of
Congress to replace volumes in the third president's personal
library that were destroyed in a fire in the Capitol in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be on the team in this way,'' Jones said,
speaking at a news conference in the ornate office of James
Billington, librarian of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a display of some of Jefferson's original books,
Jones called them ``treasures of our past'' and said he wanted
students learning about Jefferson ``to feel the roar of the crowd,
so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Also evoking sports imagery, Billington said: ``The generosity
of this gift is, in itself, remarkable. But in the heart of
Washington Redskins territory, it is particularly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones kicked off the library's plan to celebrate its 200th
anniversary next year by giving Billington a duplicate of a grammar
book purchased by Jefferson in 1785. The book, published in 1765
with the title ``Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry Concerning
Universal Grammar,'' was written by James Harris, an English
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress plans to use the gift from Jones to
recreate Jefferson's original collection of 6,400 books by
replacing 987 destroyed or missing volumes with rare duplicates
from other libraries, private collections or antiquarian
booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare himself with Jefferson, the Cowboys' owner at
first demurred, saying that the author of the Declaration of
Independence ``is an example to us all.'' Then he added: ``I'd like
to think he was a sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, the library's expert on Jefferson, curator Gerard
Gawalt, stepped forward to speak about Jefferson's love of horse
racing and hunting. ``The fit between Mr. Jones and Mr. Jefferson
is a lot closer than one would think at first glance,'' Gawalt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take that,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson had a direct connection to the Library of Congress.
His books were purchased by Congress to be the core of the library
after British invaders burned the Capitol in 1814 during the War of
1812, which ended with a peace treaty signed Dec. 24, 1814, in
Ghent, Belgium. The Library of Congress was first housed in the
Capitol; it is now directly across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The second fire, in 1851, started in a faulty chimney flue in
the Capitol and destroyed two-thirds of the collection. Jefferson's
catalogue survived the flames, enabling curators to rebuild the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Billington described it Wednesday as a ``universal collection''
that reflected the diverse interests ``of this universal man.''
Among the items that the Library of Congress' experts will be
seeking are a pamphlet on pomegranates and a book on pasta
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has a collection of more than 115
million items, including the diaries of aviation pioneers Orville
and Wilbur Wright, the music of George and Ira Gershwin and Leonard
Bernstein. It is now digitizing many of its collections to make
them accessible on the Internet.
