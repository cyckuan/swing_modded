	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $1.5 million public-private project to  
preserve hundreds of movies, such as Paul Robeson's ``The Emperor 
Jones'' and Frank Capra's World War II series ``Why We Fight,'' is 
being organized by a federally authorized foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials on Tuesday announced the millennium program, called  
Treasures of American Film Archives. The coordinators are the 
National Film Preservation Foundation, set up by Congress, and the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia is making a $200,000  
contribution on the heels of a $500,000 NEA grant in February. The 
American Film Institute and other industry groups have also 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 17 separate archives will take part, including five  
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of movies, some only a few minutes long, will be copied  
onto modern film stocks. Workers will preserve a master copy, from 
which viewing copies will be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Library of Congress will work on ``The Emperor Jones'' and a  
collection from the laboratories of inventor Thomas A. Edison. It 
will also preserve footage taken in the field by anthropologist 
Margaret Mead, author of the landmark ``Coming of Age in Samoa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies made before the 1950s were on highly flammable nitrate  
film, library officials say. Since then, newer and safer film stock 
has been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Archives will do the seven-film Capra series,  
commissioned by the War Department to overcome the isolationist 
feeling strong in the United States before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Ellington's baritone saxophonist for 35 years, Harry  
Carney, took pictures of the orchestra between 1938 and 1941. The 
National Museum of American History will be in charge of those, and 
of shorts on communications technology that Western Union started 
more than 70 years ago.
