<HEADLINE> Library of Congress Faces Problems  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are
presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving
the nation's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest library -- over 119 million items -- has
high-quality housings for its collection of cardboard baseball
cards going back more than 100 years, including one that shows Ty
Cobb stealing third base.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too hot, not too cold; not too moist, not too dry,''
curator Harry Katz describes the conditions for assuring they don't
deteriorate into paper mache or dust. ''It's the same problem as
preserving the Gutenberg Bible or Ansel Adams photos, though the
parameters are different, depending on the materials.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new digital trading cards on three-inch CD-ROMs will
require also preserving what will inevitably become antique
computer technology to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ''One problem is the hardware,'' Katz said. ''Technology moves
so fast that in a few years today's computers may be obsolete. No
use keeping the disks if they can't be read. How much equipment do
we have to preserve, too?''
</P>
<P>
   As society becomes more digitalized, the library is increasingly
looking at computer capacity as much as warehouse space in planning
its future needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many gigabytes should you have?'' Katz asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many archives now exist only on the Internet, and it's not just
archives.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of artists -- increasingly -- don't work on paper. Their
work is just images you can see on a monitor,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the Library of Congress gets two copies of books and
other printed materials that are copyrighted. It doesn't keep all
of them because it doesn't have the warehouse space.
</P>
<P>
   It now faces the same problem with cyberspace: which artists and
which works to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to identify the best people and the work we want to
keep,'' Katz said. ''We've been bandying a lot of names around, but
we don't have a list yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Roosa, chief of the library's conservation division,
divides the problem into two areas: material that is ''born
digital'' and information that is ''reborn digital.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''born digital'' includes art, electronic books, scientific
journals, music and multi-media presentations. ''For instance, some
of the music never resides in any format unless the end user
decides to do it,'' said Roosa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reborn digital'' material is taken from crumbling paper
documents, wax cylinders like those Thomas Edison used for the
first recordings, early television programs recorded on two-inch
videotapes that can only be read by a few remaining pieces of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 80 or 90 different formats for videotapes,'' Roosa
said, ''You can't get the manufacturers to go back to old
technologies and make the spare parts. We have to be sure when we
get information in new forms that we can migrate it forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The library has a lot of conservation problems.
</P>
<P>
   Microfilm, a relatively low-tech device, has been preserving
newspapers for decades. Not satisfied with that, the library wanted
to keep the actual pages of The New York Times special supplement
of April 28, 1912, on the sinking of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The ZFB Co. in Leipzig, Germany, had an experimental
paper-splitting process. It smoothed each page, covered it gently
with a transparent tissue attached by a gelatin adhesive and
inserted a sheet of acid-free paper between them. The acid in
newsprint makes it crumble in a few decades. Then the experts
encapsulated each page in a polyester film.
