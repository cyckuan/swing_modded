<P>
   Boston was threatened by smallpox, and from his nearby
headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., George Washington ordered his
troops to stay out of the city. It was March 19, 1776, and the
orders were written by hand.
</P>
<P>
   This letter and hundreds of others in their original form can be
read on the Internet at the American Memory site of the Library of
Congress, one of the libraries leading the way in a quiet
revolution that is changing the way knowledge is shared around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   From papyri to Civil War letters and diaries, from old baseball
cards to photographs of Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull, millions of
unique items in libraries, archives and museums are being digitized
and made available in facsimile on the Internet to anyone, not just
scholars with the time and money to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Many items can be located through an automated system of finding
aids developed over the last five years by a group that has
included university librarians, the Society of American Archivists
and the Library of Congress. Finding aids describe what is in the
folders and boxes in which libraries and archives keep their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is going to change the whole organization of
knowledge,'' said Timothy Hoyer, head of technical services at the
Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley, which
has been in on the cutting edge of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers involved are huge: The Library of Congress, which
has 117 million items in its archives, hopes to have 4 million
items digitized and accessible on the World Wide Web by the turn of
the century. The Denver Public Library expects to put 95,000
photographs of the old West online. California has linked 35
universities and museums into one online archive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Public Records Office in London, archivists are creating
a catalog of all British public records dating to the Domesday Book
of the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   With help from experts at New York University, the New-York
Historical Society is trying to digitize one of the great American
history collections.
</P>
<P>
   No one place is available online where Web users can search the
finding aids for all these collections. But the Research Libraries
Group, an international alliance of 160 institutions, including
universities, libraries, archives and museums, has set up an
Archival Resources service that is moving toward this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision goes back to the Enlightenment,'' said Daniel
Pitti, project director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
the Humanities at the University of Virginia. ``It was the dream of
the scholar to go to one place and find out what exists, where it
is, and what they need to get access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illusion to think we'll digitize everything out there
_ we're talking about hundreds of millions of items,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of items that have been digitized have occasionally been
more interesting than the originals. A digitized photo of the San
Francisco earthquake of 1906, for example, can be manipulated to
see paintings on the walls of buildings that cannot be seen in the
original photograph. A piece of papyrus, enlarged on a computer,
does not have to be viewed under a microscope. It was papyrus that
led some archivists to think of constructing digitized collections
so that valuable, fragile materials would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1,500 pieces of papyri dating back to 4,000 B.C.,''
said Steven Hensen, director of planning and project development in
the rare book, manuscript and special collections library at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke was photographing and cataloguing its collection, he
said, ``the World Wide Web burst upon the scene, and we had this
flash: Why make photos? Why not scan them and see if we can put
them up on the Web and make them accessible worldwide?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Bagnall, professor of classics and history at Columbia
University, is heading an effort by Duke, Columbia, the University
of Michigan, Berkeley, Yale and Princeton to build a virtual
collection of 50,000 pieces of papyri that could eventually be
linked to collections in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, ultimately, going to have translations for everything
that's actually been read,'' Bagnall said, ``and anything with a
Greek text will also have an English text.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened in papyrus could happen with other unique
collections, said Stephen Griffin, head of the division of
information and intelligent systems at the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of photographs, maps and texts at a University of
Virginia Web site called ``The Valley of the Shadow,'' an archive
of two communities, Staunton, Va., and Chambersburg, Pa., on
opposite sides of the Mason-Dixon line during the Civil War, has
been visited by 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell the story of the Civil War on a human
level,'' said Edward Ayres, a history professor who first thought
of the project. First on a computer and then on the Internet, he
and a colleague, William Thomas, tried to see ``if we could put out
all the raw materials out of which historians construct the past in
ways people who are not historians could explore,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is that you'll slowly see, in your own mind, a
three-dimensional world emerge,'' he said. ``If you read the census
entries and see that a soldier is 48 and has left three young
children at home, and he's a widower, all of a sudden the lines in
his letters have a different meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Humanities has supported this and
other projects throughout the country to make cultural resources
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would gain the country little if we spent millions to
preserve materials and no one knew where they were, or if we spent
millions to gain access to materials that couldn't be seen because
they were too fragile,'' said George Farr, director of the division
of preservation and access at the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   At the Library of Congress, the manuscript division is closed to
high school students and most university undergraduates. Even
scholars can only look at presidential manuscripts on microfiche.
But at the American Memory site, the Washington letters can be seen
in their original form. The site gets 10 million to 12 million
visits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we have clients who couldn't come through our
doors,'' said Hoyer, who helps direct the online archive of the
California Digital Library.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Yesson, manager of the California Heritage project at the
Berkeley library, has been helping elementary school teachers use
the California Heritage Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fourth-grade class in Oakland did a unit on the gold rush
and went to Sutter's Fort,'' she said. ``Then they went to the
California Heritage site to see what it looked like back in the
gold rush.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected result, she said, was the students' relationship
with the university. Once teachers explained what an archive was,
the students wanted to come to campus to see the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few times that archivists have found
themselves leading the parade,'' Hensen said. ``We're used to
sweeping up behind the elephants.''
