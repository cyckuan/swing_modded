<HEADLINE> Libraries Superior to Internet, Research Finds </HEADLINE>

JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Libraries are still a more
accurate source of information than the Internet, thus students
should not confine their research only to the Net, according to a
Bar-Ilan University researcher in Israel.
</P>
<P>
David Schwartz, a researcher of the university's school of
business administration, compared materials on various subjects
found in the world's three major libraries, the U.S. Library of
Congress, the New York Public Library, and the British Royal
Library, to Internet researches he carried out on the same topics.
</P>
<P>
In each case, Schwartz said, the representation of the topics
on the Internet was inferior to that in the three libraries.
</P>
<P>
Many Internet sites are profit-oriented, so one can not always
trust the information provided by vested interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has opened up a treasure of information for
researchers and seekers of knowledge throughout the world, and it
has become common practice to turn to the Internet as a convenient
source of information," he said.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the effectiveness of Internet int is presenting
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
It is a foregone conclusion that the Internet will become the
infrastructure for a global digital library, he continued, "but
this is still years away from happening."
