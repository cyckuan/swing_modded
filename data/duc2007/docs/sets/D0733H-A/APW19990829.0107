	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond  
met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need 
only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by 
the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map shows just where Tom Sawyer whitewashed his famous  
fence. Still another points out the spot at which Paul Bunyan's ox 
Babe, trying to catch a field mouse, dug the Mammoth Cave. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful World of Oz'' is charted.  
Illustrator Dick Martin located the Shifting Sands and Deadly 
Desert, with Emerald City and Gunda's Palace smack in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yellow Brick Road is there too, though it's not clearly  
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literary maps depict ideas as much as places,'' wrote  
co-author Martha Hopkins in the book's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Most literary maps, Hopkins notes, are not drawn to scale and  
contain little detailed information on topography, geology, towns, 
rivers or roads. They ``present a world in which authors and books 
are the dominant features,'' she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the places are real enough. Author Ian Fleming  
made his James Bond stories credible by searching out authentic 
settings for what the library calls his ``assignments and 
assignations.'' Only ``Agent 007'' himself and his exploits sprang 
from Fleming's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	J.R.R. Tolkien's completely imaginary ``Middle Earth'' rates  
three highly detailed maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between reality and imagination lies Mark Twain's St.  
Petersburg, the home of Tom Sawyer, modeled on Hannibal, Mo. That's 
where the young Sam Clemens lived before he went piloting on the 
Mississippi, where he got his pen-name. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-whitewashed fence is on St. Petersburg's Hill Street,  
just across from Becky Thatcher's house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a  
place that a book has talked about,'' Twain quotes Tom as saying in 
later life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Language of the Land'' describes and reproduces the fantastic  
maps, along with many others covering the literary landscape. It 
was compiled by Hopkins of the library's Interpretive Programs 
Office and Michael Buscher of the Geography and Map Division. 
</P>
<P>
	The maps mostly cover English-speaking countries -- Canada and  
Australia have maps that illustrate their best-known books. Even 
one for Paris gives a large space to Oscar Wilde and American 
writer Gertrude Stein, whom the French do not see as important to 
their literature. There's also a bright map, shaped and colored 
like a parrot -- written in English -- devoted to Latin American 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Maps from days when Latin and Greek got more intensive study  
show the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas. Even troubled Balkan 
politics gets touched on -- unintentionally. A map on places in 
Hungarian literature includes portions of Romania which once 
belonged to Hungary, and which many Hungarians would dearly like to 
get back.
