 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In October the Library of Congress opens the doors of its Thomas
Jefferson Building for the largest exhibit ever assembled on the
life and work of Sigmund Freud.
 &HT;    If the Library's estimates are correct, by the time the show
closes on Jan. 16, more than a quarter million people will have
inspected Freud's handwritten case notes on immortal patients such
as the Rat Man, the famous letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess in
which Freud renounces the so-called seduction theory and dozens of
other manuscripts and first editions from the library's vast
collection of Freudiana.
 &HT;    Visitors will see the actual chair Dr. Freud used in his
examining room, the actual kilim rug that draped the iconic couch,
his actual spectacles and a phalanx of the antiquities Freud
collected and arrayed with fetishistic precision on his desk.
 &HT;    What makes this exhibit remarkable, however, is not so much the
objects in it as the fact that it is happening at all. In the
jagged cardiogram that is the history of Freud's reputation, 1998
is not, after all, a peak. Managed care has been notoriously
inhospitable to long-term psychotherapy and notoriously hospitable
to the quicker, cheaper fixes of behavior mod and Prozac.
 &HT;    The steady drip-drip of Freud criticism over the past decade _
attacks on his personal character, his originality, his therapeutic
models and his scientific status _ has corroded the cultural
prestige psychoanalysis once enjoyed among American intellectuals.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud show could just as easily have been doomed
by the increasingly contentious politics of museum curatorship as
by the anti-Freudian zeitgeist _ and for a time it looked as if it
would be.
 &HT;    Museums _ especially history museums _ are now subject, in
unprecedented degree, to the scrutiny and pressure tactics of
interest groups, many of which insist on being heard at the
earliest planning stages of a show and, more and more successfully,
on getting their point of view incorporated into exhibits.
 &HT;    Witness the fate of the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian's
National Air and Space museum, drastically altered after veterans
complained that it portrayed the Japanese as victims and failed to
credit the bombing of Hiroshima with ending the war.
 &HT;    Or the exhibit of 19th- and 20th-century photographs called
``Back of the Big House: The Cultural Landscape of the
Plantation,'' scheduled by the Library of Congress to open two
years ago but canceled entirely after a group of African-American
library staff members complained that the images it contained _ of
slaves and slave quarters _ were offensive.
 &HT;    Or the recent Smithsonian exhibit on the history of sweatshops,
which drew indignant protests from clothing industry lobbyists.
They didn't like the fact that the mock-up of a sweatshop featured
in the show happened to be one that made not cigars or trinkets but
apparel. The dust-up over ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture''
came just after the Enola Gay and ``Big House'' protests, and
seemed to presage a similar end.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, about a year after the library appointed
a guest curator and scheduled the exhibit, an independent
researcher and irrepressible Freud skeptic named Peter Swales
rallied about 50 other scholars, most of whom had published work
critical of Freud, to sign a petition. The show's planning
committee, the petitioners complained, was stacked with
psychoanalytic apologists and its goal, as one of the signatories
put it in an interview, was simply ``to polish up the tarnished
image of a business'' _ psychoanalysis _ ``that's heading into
Chapter 11.''
 &HT;    The petition said nothing about canceling or even postponing the
exhibit. But in December of that year, when the library suddenly
announced that it was delaying the show indefinitely, the decision
was widely perceived as a capitulation to the petitioners and to
the threat of controversy. The library's own explanation _ that it
had run short of funds _ convinced virtually no one writing about
the story at the time.
 &HT;    ``Underlying the attempt to block the Freud exhibit was a
particularly dangerous notion: that an institution owned by the
government should avoid doing anything controversial,'' wrote the
New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis. In the pages of The New
Republic, the sociologist Todd Gitlin declared that, just as it had
in the case of the ``Back of the Big House'' show, the library had
``chosen suppression over exhibition, silencing over debate.''
 &HT;    It now looks as if the library did delay the exhibit primarily
for financial reasons _ it was $350,000 shy of the $900,000 budget
projected for the exhibit, and this was not the first or last time
that it had postponed shows for lack of funds.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud petitioners had not mobilized the support of
members of Congress, as the Enola Gay protesters had, nor did their
objections pivot on racial sensitivities, patriotism or the kind of
populist, defense-of-decency politics that drove the disputes over
art-museum shows _ such as the one devoted to Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs. For these reasons, the library could afford not to
yield to them.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, it was the assumption that it was caving in to
pressure that allowed the library to raise the extra money it
needed for the show. Members of the American Psychoanalytic
Association organized a letter-writing campaign. Subsequently, the
Discovery Channel made a gift of $125,000 and the Jewish Museum in
New York signed on as a new venue to which the exhibit would
travel. A number of individuals made small, unsolicited donations,
often tucked into letters decrying Freud-bashing or censorship or
both.
 &HT;    And yet it will be difficult for anyone who sees ``Freud'' and
who remembers the squall over it to judge it without some of the
criteria of the anti-Freudians in mind. Welcome to the era of
preemptive-strike criticism.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when library officials chose the Freud show's
guest curator, they selected, rather cannily, a young cultural
historian named Michael S. Roth. Roth, who was then at the
Claremont Graduate School and is now at the Getty Research
Institute in Los Angeles, was only 38 at the time.
 &HT;    And despite the fact that he had written a book called
``Psycho-Analysis as History: Negation and Freedom in Freud,''
Freudian theory wasn't really his specialty or obsession _ he had
published just as much about Hegel. His intellectual preoccupation
is with memory (``how people make sense of the past and what
happens when they can't or won't,'' as he puts it), which might be
thought of as a Freudian theme, but which clearly isn't exclusively
one.
 &HT;    For a time it seemed that even the petitioners were willing to
see Roth as a well-meaning sort, at worst a dupe of the older and
more orthodox members of the show's planning committee _ the
historian Peter Gay and the analyst Harold Blum, for instance.
 &HT;    ``It seems so odd to talk of a significant cultural figure in
terms of he's great or he's bad,'' Roth told me in an interview one
rainy evening this past summer. ``Historians don't talk that way.
It's almost hubris to talk that way.''
 &HT;    Yet in the saga of this exhibit, there was Roth, with his wry,
agnostic, historian's turn of mind, called upon to negotiate with
Freud critics for whom there was really only one salient question:
Was Freud right? and one answer: No.
 &HT;    ``It was so strange. I was used to the atmosphere of a small
college,'' Roth said, shaking his head. ``And then this petition
came up and the postponing of the show and all the press coverage
of it, and suddenly friends were calling me from France saying, 'My
God, Michael, we hear you're being burned in effigy over there.'''
 &HT;    The Library of Congress owns the pre-eminent Freud collection in
the world, but much of the material in it had arrived with
restrictions imposed by the organization that had assembled it, the
Sigmund Freud Archives.
 &HT;    In recent years, however, the library had engineered a
compromise with the archives' director, Blum, to make some sealed
papers available if the names of patients were blacked out by
reviewers chosen by the archives. In the year 2000, almost all of
the previously restricted material was at last due to be opened
anyway.
 &HT;    The exhibit, then, was to be for the collection a sort of early
and symbolic ``coming-out party,'' as the Librarian of Congress,
James Billington, took to calling it.
 &HT;    Then Swales entered the picture. Among the loose assembly of
Freud skeptics, Swales is the anti-Freudians' anti-Freudian. This
is not only because of his research over the last 25 years,
revealing the true identities of several early patients of Freud's
who had been known only by their pseudonyms, but because of his
appetite for provocation.
 &HT;    Swales is 50 now but still something of an enfant terrible. He
grew up in rural Wales, ran away from high school and home at 17
and spent much of his early career toiling in the British pop
industry, mainly as a personal assistant to the Rolling Stones.
Freud studies was something Swales fell into in the early '70s,
while working in New York with Stonehill Publishing, which brought
out the first thorough study of Freud's early infatuation with
cocaine.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, when Swales began circulating a letter of
protest about the library's Freud exhibition, it didn't take him
long to collect nearly 50 names. Some of them were obvious choices
_ for example, Frederick Crews, the literary critic turned
Freud-loathing polemicist who holds Freud responsible for
everything from ``egocentric and prurient encouragement to look for
low motives in everyone'' to the excesses of the recovered-memory
movement.
 &HT;    Gloria Steinem, a Freud disser from way back, added a glint of
celebrity to the campaign. And some of the signatories were rather
surprising _ the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, for one, who
had never made common cause with the anti-Freudians. (Sacks later
distanced himself from the affair, telling Psychiatric News that
``No one who knows me could imagine me as an anti-Freudian.'')
 &HT;    Apart from its rather mild language, the letter made one odd
request _ namely, that a man named Henry Cohen, an attorney at the
Congressional Research Service who was friendly with some of the
petitioners, sit in on committee meetings ``to keep all of us
apprised of the deliberations and developments.''
 &HT;    Roth would not have it: ``I remember being really disturbed by
the idea that we would have this guy who was not a Freud scholar
and who happened to be a lawyer monitoring us,'' he says.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, in the fall of 1995, Roth made a number of
overtures to the petitioners. He felt they deserved a serious
response and he clearly hated the idea of being construed as a
propagandist.
 &HT;    In October, he sent the petitioners each a ``Dear Scholar''
letter in which he said that they had ``alerted me to the dangers
that the exhibit might unwittingly contain a partisan defense of
Freud, or that we might not have paid sufficient attention to the
recent historical and philosophical critiques of psychoanalysis.''
 &HT;    That fall (and indeed over the next two years), Roth grappled
with the question of how an exhibit whose fundamental purpose was
to showcase manuscripts in Freud's own hand and to explicate for
the widest possible audience the ideas they contained could, at the
same time, do justice to the contemporary critique of Freud.
 &HT;    ``Some people wanted an exhibit that said that Freud was wrong,
that he was a bad person, that, as one critic put it, we should
have the moral courage to condemn him,'' Roth says. ``Well, that's
just not what this particular show is about.''
 &HT;    It turns out that in the end, some of the critics are
represented in a series of quotes that wrap around the display
panels and amplify or refute the arguments of the manuscripts
below. They are a little too sound-bite-y, though, to convey much
sense of their authors' objections.
 &HT;    And they are surrounded by quotes from earlier critics _
Wittgenstein, Nabokov, Germaine Greer _ which tend to make the
contemporaries seem like merely the latest and tinniest voices in a
long and clamorous parade of Freud detractors. Freud has always
generated resentment, this cacophony of commentary seems to say,
and yet, look: He's still with us.
 &HT;    For a while, Roth wanted to end the show with a section called
``Contested Legacies,'' which would have highlighted the continuing
debate over Freudian theory. He liked the idea of introducing this
section with ``two very simple, direct questions about
psychoanalysis: Is it true? and Does it work?''
 &HT;    But the other advisers worried that they were in danger of
accentuating the conflict over Freud at the expense of what they
saw as their first duty: setting out his ideas. Besides, they
concluded, the average museumgoer might well be alienated by an
exhibit that seemed preoccupied with what was essentially a debate
among scholars.
 &HT;    Now what viewers will see near the end of the exhibit, bracketed
by photos of Nazi book-burnings and of Freud's four sisters who
perished in concentration camps, are the manuscripts of ``A Word
about Anti-Semitism,'' ``Why War?'' and ``Civilization and its
Discontents.''
 &HT;    It is curious that the Freud show protests _ and all the new
museum protests _ seem to share the notion, or fear, that every
museumgoer will interpret an exhibit in exactly the same way and
indeed, exactly as its planners intended.
 &HT;    ``The premise behind all these protests,'' says Steven Conn, a
museum historian at Ohio State University, ``is that all museum
exhibits come heavily laden with political and interpretive baggage
_ and there is only one way to read them. The audience is
essentially a passive receptacle.''
 &HT;    But why should that be so? ``No one thinks of texts that way
anymore,'' as Conn points out. ``No one would argue that there is
only one way to read 'Hamlet.'''
 &HT;    On the one hand, the interest groups that protest museum shows
take a skeptical, post-modern view of exhibits. They maintain that
neutrality and objectivity are flimsy veils for the inescapably
ideological agendas of curators. And on the other hand, they take a
rather old-fashioned, not to say condescending, view of the
audience for those exhibits: They will think what they are being
told what to think.
 &HT;    The question is: Why should the rest of us accept that premise?
