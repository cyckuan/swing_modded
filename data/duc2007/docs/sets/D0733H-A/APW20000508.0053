   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legendary entertainer Bob Hope is in
Washington to attend the opening of the permanent Bob Hope Gallery
of American Entertainment in the Library of Congress.

   ''He's anxious to be here,'' Hope publicist Ward Grant said
today. ''We're anxious to get him here and get some photographs at
the exhibit.''

   Hope and wife, Delores, arrived Saturday, Grant said. Hope is
scheduled to attend a private reception Tuesday evening at the
library.

   Hope's son Anthony, daughter Linda, and singer Connie Stevens
spoke at a press preview of the exhibit today.

   ''I'm looking forward to going through this collection myself
and reliving and resharing those times and I hope the public feels
the same way,'' Anthony Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Stevens, ''He taught me more than anything to make the
stage my home and the audience my family.''

   The exhibit includes 88,000 pages of jokes given to the library
by Hope as well as countless other letters, photos, videos and
other momentos.

   ''His career pretty much parallels the history of American
entertainment. He excelled in all the mediums,'' said Library of
Congress spokesman Craig D'Ooge. ''It's both a history of Bob Hope
and a history of American entertainment.''

   The Hope family has donated $3.5 million for the upkeep of the
items.
