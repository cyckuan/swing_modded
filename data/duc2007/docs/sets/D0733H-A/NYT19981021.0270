   The Library of Congress, the world's most voluminous library,
grew by the equivalent of 2 million books on a single day last
week. But rather than build thousands of new stacks to accommodate
the growth, the library could fit the new addition into a small
filing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the latest donation to the library came in the
form of computer disks _ 44 of them, each carrying 40 gigabytes of
information. The disks include a snapshot of the entire contents of
the World Wide Web during the first two months of 1997, including
each of the millions of individual Web sites _ the good, the bad,
and even the smutty stuff Congress does not want kids to see.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was gathered, stored and donated by Alexa
Internet of San Francisco, which has developed a tool bar that
makes it easy to view Web-site background information like where
the site is located, whether it has a privacy policy, or if it has
won third-party endorsements or awards. The company's president,
Brewster Kahle, said the donation preserves a moment in the life of
the ever-evolving Web and can become a resource for sociologists
and, eventually, historians who want to understand our era.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, while the disks are on display at the library _ as part of
an interactive sculpture _ their contents are not _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a laboratory experiment for us,'' said Guy
Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library of Congress, noting that
some of the material was not suitable for the collections, and the
library was still working out copyright issues. ``We will be using
it to explore how to preserve digital materials, and how to provide
access to these materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahle, who also oversees the non-profit organization Internet
Archive, said the Web is growing at a rate of 1.5 million pages a
day. Sounds as if the Library of Congress, in planning for future
donations, had better set aside a large file cabinet.

   Videophone Call-Ins On a Cable TV Channel
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has made it possible to perform all sorts of tasks
without leaving the house _ banking, working, even dating. Credit
ZDTV, a fledgling 24-hour cable channel with programming focused on
computer issues, for using the Net to make a virtual community out
of yet another group: the studio audience. The San Francisco-based
network urges viewers to call in to its programs using
Internet-based videophones, which transmit not just voices, but
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry King says, `We'll go to Altoona, Pa., for our next
call,' '' said Greg Derbin, senior vice president for programming
and production at the network, ``and you'll hear the caller. With
ZDTV, you'll see the caller.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage wider participation, ZDTV will give away up to
10,000 videophones, called Netcams because they transmit their
audio and video signals over the Internet. From Oct. 26 to 31, it
plans to give away one videophone every hour, on its Web site,
Drebin said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lingering questions like whether viewers want to
see each other in the slow-motion video that comes across a
videophone with a modem connection. Then again, there may not be
too many viewers to complain. ZDTV, which is owned by Ziff-Davis
and began broadcasting in May, reaches only 8 million homes, a
strong start, but a far cry from a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   Survey Will Track Internet Audiences
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether people are tuning in to radio
programs over the Internet _ they are, albeit not in mass numbers.
The question is whether the listeners count.
</P>
<P>
   As radio stations decide whether to spend money to stream their
audio content over their Web sites, many are struggling with the
business model. They want to be able to measure the size of their
Internet audience _ and, in turn, market it to advertisers _ before
they make the investment in audio streaming.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, The Arbitron Co., which measures traditional
radio audiences in local markets, last week announced plans to
modify its surveys to track which of the stations' listeners tune
in over the Internet. The new plan is a joint effort between
Arbitron NewMedia and RadioWave.com Inc., the interactive radio
subsidiary of Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,708 radio stations worldwide that stream audio, up
from 763 a year ago, said BRS Media, an Internet radio consulting
agency. But thousands of others _ among them, CBS Corp., which owns
about 160 radio stations and has a policy against streaming audio _
have abstained, in part because they want to be able to accurately
measure the audiences.

   Volunteers Answer Questions Via Internet
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The copious information available on the Net is all
well and good, as far as Steve Gordon, a New York lawyer is
concerned, except that Gordon figures that people spend hours
trying to find the one bit of expertise they are looking for. So he
decided to put a bunch of the experts in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon recently launched Allexperts (www.allexperts.com), a Web
site that allows visitors to question 2,000 e-mail volunteers on
topics like entertainment, computers, and medicine and get a free
reply.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the volunteers are not exactly experts _ the television
and music volunteers are entertainment fanatics whom Gordon
discovered in chat rooms, news groups and on Web sites _ but in the
case of the medical sites, most volunteers are doctors or
academics, Gordon said. ``If you have a keen or critical question,
you don't spend two hours researching it,'' Gordon said. ``You can
spend two minutes researching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says the site does not vouch for the replies, which he
says are meant to serve as general information, not specific advice
or diagnosis. ``It's a chance to talk to people that you might not
have a chance to,'' he said. ``For example, I personally don't know
any neurologists.''

   New Inkjet Printer Has a Darkroom Inside
</P>
<P>
   One clear trend in electronics is to package ever more functions
in a single device, turning a cellular phone, for example, into a
beeper, e-mail receiver, messaging center, bottle opener _ and, by
the way, a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with this trend, Lexmark International Inc. of
Lexington, Ky., is scheduled next week to ship a new inkjet printer
that is also a digital darkroom. The Lexmark Photo Jetprinter 5770
is designed to print digital pictures without a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Photo Jetprinter has a slot into which users can insert a
digital film cartridge. This means users no longer have to upload
the pictures onto a PC, format them and send them to the printer,
said Patrick King, Lexmark's general manager for Digital Photo
Printer.
</P>
<P>
   The printer is expected to sell for $349, and individual
pictures will cost around 60 cents, taking into account the cost of
ink and paper, King said. He said that compared with a cost of 40
cents to 70 cents per print for pictures developed at a
conventional lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the upper end,'' King said. ``But the difference is,
with our printer, you're only paying for the ones you want.''
</P>
<P>
   With some estimates that the digital camera and photoprinter
industry will reach $6 billion a year by 2002, Lexmark believes the
new printer is worth an investment in research and development.
</P>

   Group Wants to Free Software Source Code
</P>
<P>
   A group of concerned hackers and Netizens met on Oct. 9 at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to fight for the transparency
of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Free Software Foundation, met to celebrate its
philosophy that the source code that underlies software programs
should be freely and openly distributed. The group reasons that, if
the software were readily available, it would be easier for
programmers to enhance programs and fix bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, thousands of developers freely and openly distribute
their source code. Still, and not surprisingly, the concept meets
with no small friction from companies that are no keener about
publishing their source code than Coca-Cola is about publishing its
secret formula.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which was started by Richard Stallman, on Friday
presented its first Free Software Award to Larry Wall for his
contribution to free software development. Wall worked on Perl
software, a robust and widely used language for text manipulation
and system management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Wall,'' wrote the Free Software Foundation, ``has always
promoted keeping his implementations free for all to study, enhance
and build on, without restrictions, and the freedom for all to
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the group may want to schedule next year's meeting
for Berkeley.
