U.S. TO ESTABLISH STRICT NEW RULES FOR REGULATING ORGANIC FOOD
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government's
first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win
public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much
tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified
ingredients in products carrying the organic label. The rules also
prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and
the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, to be announced next week, could take effect by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the
original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those
three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered
allowing.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's
attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps
it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have
mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic
food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use
of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could turn out to be the most important rule USDA has
issued in 20 years,'' said Dr. Margaret Mellon, the director of the
agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group in Washington that had
urged the agency to toughen its earlier proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Agriculture Department's policies have made small farmers
an endangered species,'' Mellon said. ``Now it is trying to
construct a system to allow small farmers to help them survive, to
help them flourish. It is also a turning point in its relationship
to consumers. The agency has never before been responsive to
consumers' desires or demands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if
the public thought the standards were too strict they should let
the department know during the 90-day comment period before the
agency enacts the final rules. ``I'd rather go from too strict
standards and ease them than going the other way,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of
what constitutes organic food. After initially ignoring many of the
recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had
been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the
Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice,
including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as
organic; the use of 100 percent organic feed; and the requirement
of outdoor access for animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a
year. When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in
1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales
for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal
agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100
percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured
without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic
ingredients could also carry the seal. And processed food
containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled
``made with organic ingredients'' and list up to three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be
prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the
conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Products made with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may
use the word organic only in the list of ingredients on the side
panel; in this case, the prohibition against those three processes
would not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised
rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in
any other country and have set the bar very high for organic
farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than
encouraging them to grow organic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry
expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too
far,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic
Trade Association. ``The standards seem to be written in a vacuum
and do not take into account what supplies, ingredients and
production materials are actually available. I am afraid that some
people are not going to bother to be organic anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new
rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated
with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops. An Agriculture
Department official said that no level for drift had been set but a
farmer would not be penalized if some low level of contamination
occurred as long as he had followed all of the organic procedures
required.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic
farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a
$5.5 million request for organic research. In addition, the
Agriculture Department has a pilot project for crop insurance for
organic farmers and is studying other things that might help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I want to preserve family farming,'' Glickman said.
``We need economic avenues for small- and medium-size farms and
this is one way to do this. Clearly organic agriculture is a way
farmers can make more money.''
</P>

mail or on the Internet at www.ams.usda.gov/nop.
