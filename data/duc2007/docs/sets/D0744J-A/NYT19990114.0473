U.S. TO ALLOW ORGANIC LABEL ON SOME MEATS AND POULTRY 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON The Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that
it would allow farmers who raise meat and poultry without
pesticide-treated feed, growth hormones or antibiotics to label
their meat ``certified organic.''
</P>
<P>
   That meat will be the only organic food with a certification
process approved by the federal government. State regulations for
years have allowed organic labels on many other foods, but meat and
poultry have always been in a different category, subject to more
stringent federal labeling regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The federal rules go into effect immediately, and need no
legislative approval. They are welcomed by companies that grow
organic meat, who have been frustrated in attempts to market a
premium product. Many foods labeled organic sell for 10 percent to
50 percent above the price of similar nonorganic foods.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Agriculture Department treated the organic food
industry as if it did not exist. But as sales grew more than 20
percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for
$1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice,
proposing national organic standards for all food.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal met with stiff resistance from more than 275,000
people who said they opposed the federal standards because they
would lower the state standards already in place. In an unusual
move the agency withdrew the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   An Agriculture Department spokesman described the new meat and
poultry policy as ``an interim step,'' until national standards
exist, which may come next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a boon for small companies like us,'' said Allen
Shainsky, owner of Petaluma Poultry Processors in Petaluma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Shainsky's company sells around 120,000 birds per week, and he
said he hoped to be selling 15,000 organic birds a week within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Moody, a feed coordinator for the Coulee Region Organic
Produce Pool, or Cropp, in LaFarge, Wis., which sells its products
under the Organic Valley label, said: ``This means a lot to us. We
have not been able to get full value out of our beef cattle, our
dairy cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of going out with a national marketing program, it
has been impossible, and we have not been able to realize the true
value of our animal production,'' Moody said. ``It has held the
livestock industry back.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's
announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog
farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.
The current price is 28 cents a pound for live hogs, compared with
35 cents last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Moody said, there is more profit in organic meat
than in conventional meat. He said he expected to sell organic pork
for 60 to 70 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry
certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label. Those
standards require third-party certification that the meat and
poultry are raised on organic feed, without the use of antibiotics
or growth hormones, that they have access to the outside and that
there is a manure management plan. If an animal becomes ill and
must be given antibiotics it can no longer be sold as organic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this announcement is a sign that organic is one of the
Secretary's top priorities,'' said Katherine DeMatteo, executive
director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.,
``that he is serious about working out details of the final rule
for national organic standards. The secretary has seen that this
will create new opportunities to help small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman acted after a letter-writing campaign in the fall from
small meat and poultry producers. Opposition from the national beef
industry was quite mild. Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the
National Cattlemen's Association, said the association was
``generally supportive of niche marketing and giving consumers a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Our only concern, Ms. Harrison said, ``is that consumers
understand that products labeled organic are not safer than
products that are not labeled organic.''
