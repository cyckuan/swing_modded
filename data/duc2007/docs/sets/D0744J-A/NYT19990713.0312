 WASHINGTON: 15 months.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States
because the genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the
rest of the crop, costing American farmers about $200 million a
year. Some of the largest exporters, including Archer Daniels
Midland, have said they will no longer accept altered corn for
export and have let farmers know they want conventionally grown
corn.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of major European retailers, including Sainsbury
and Marks &AMP; Spencer from Britain, Migros from Switzerland,
Carrefour from France and Esselunga from Italy, are shopping for
sources of products that have not been genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of these actions on American farmers, who are already
in deep financial trouble, can be devastating. In trying to keep a
dialogue going with America's European trading partners, Glickman
sought to tone down the administration's rhetoric, which has
included calling Europeans ``irrational'' because of their
opposition to genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he had spoken to ``White House people'' before he
made his remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, but one
other administration official said the speech had taken them by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic modification is the insertion of genes from one species
of animal or plant or from microbes into another, permanently
altering its genetic code. It can confer resistance on plants to
certain insects and diseases that would in some cases require the
use of pesticides. Soybeans have been genetically altered so that
they can tolerate applications of an herbicide that kills the weeds
in the same field.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose genetic modification of food do so on two
grounds: The safety of these foods has never been tested and they
are harmful to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not require testing, just
assurances from the company that manufactures the genetically
modified food that it is safe. Glickman acknowledged that none of
the agencies responsible for the safety of genetically modified
foods _ USDA, FDA or Environmental Protection Agency had enough
staff or resources to conduct such testing.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental questions are more problematic. The Environmental
Defense Fund, a public interest lobbying group, filed a petition
with the EPA Tuesday asking it to require farmers to plant
conventional corn around the fields of the genetically modified
corn to prevent the escape of toxic pollens into areas where
butterflies feed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that the pesticide resistance engineered
into plants could transfer to weeds and insects, producing
superweeds and superbugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans who do not necessarily oppose genetic engineering
believe that such products should be labeled. In a survey conducted
by the European company Novartis, more than 90 percent called for
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to the
FDA demanding mandatory labeling of such foods. The Center for Food
Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, has filed a lawsuit against the
FDA to reclassify genetic modification as an additive that would
require labeling. When the Agriculture Department proposed organic
food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments
protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, known as a strong supporter of biotechnology, said in
his speech Tuesday that it was important to ``encourage the
development of these new food production systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We cannot blindly embrace their benefits. We
have to ensure public confidence in general, consumer confidence in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier this year at Purdue University, he said,
``We also can't force these new genetically engineered food
products down consumers' throats.''
</P>
<P>
   And he compared biotechnology today to nuclear power 20 years
ago. ``We have a way in this country of latching on to solutions,
pursuing them to the exclusion of others, and then watching them
sometimes backfire,'' he said. ``We did that in the late '70s when
we embraced nuclear power as the primary source of our energy
needs. Then, Three Mile Island happened. Now nuclear power is still
part of our energy grid, but it's not the only part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not put all of our eggs in the biotech basket.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a comparison that the biotech industry considers invidious
but opponents believe is valid.
