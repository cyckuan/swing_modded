 Food in the News: Interest in Organics Surges Around the Globe   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Like much of the rest of the world, the United
States continues to lurch toward a national standard for organic
food.
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture gathered the last of some 41,000
public comments on the proposed national organic standard in June.
By fall, a final version of the regulations should be ready for
adoption. It will take another 18 months, USDA officials estimate,
to actually put the standards into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said that the pending
national organic program will be ``the most comprehensive and
strongest organic standard in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. organic industry continues to see
unprecedented growth. Average organic-food sales are expected to
grow by almost 25 percent a year for the next decade, according to
USDA estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not alone in the organic revolution. An
estimated 130 countries are producing significant amounts of
certified organic food, according to Organic Perspectives magazine.
Advances abroad include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Japan.  &LR; A new organic certification and production system is
set to take effect in April. But because only a limited amount of
food meets the new standards, many producers are likely to use
alternative labels like ``reduced chemical.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Australia.  &LR; The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent
last year, driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and
a fear of genetically engineered food. But the Australian organic
market is still relatively small, with about $150 million in sales
a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ New Zealand.  &LR; An office to certify organic products for
export is expected to be in place by March. Exports will focus on
produce, but could expand to include meat and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ France.  &LR; The French are going wild for organic milk. In 1999,
production of organic milk in France rose 77 percent to about 25
million gallons. French officials expect that figure to rise to 40
million gallons this year.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, the proposed regulations offer a
national definition of the term ``organic.'' Currently, organic
food is certified by various private and state organizations that
each use their own standards for the term.
</P>
<P>
   The national standard will establish clear labeling criteria so
consumers know exactly what they are buying. Among other rules, the
regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage
sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled
``organic.'' Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed
will also be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier
for organic farmers to export their products because international
trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather
than multiple state and private standards.
