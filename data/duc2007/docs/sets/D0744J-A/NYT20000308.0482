EDITORIAL: NEW RULES ON ORGANIC FOODS

   The New York Times said in an editorial for its editions of
Thursday, March 9:
</P>

   In late 1997 the Department of Agriculture proposed rules that
would have established a nationwide certification program for
organic foods. During the 90-day comment period that followed, it
became clear just how badly the department had stumbled. Rather
than heed the advice of its own National Organic Standards Board,
the agency would have allowed the use of irradiation, sewage sludge
and genetically modified organisms in the growing and preparation
of foods to be called organic. Whatever one thinks of those
particular practices, they are hardly what most people would
consider ``organic.'' The outcry from consumers and organic farmers
forced reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the agency released a Revised Proposed Rule. It is a
dramatically improved document that may signal a significant new
direction at Agriculture. To quote the department's own press
release, the new rule ``specifically prohibits the use of genetic
engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation in the production of
food products labeled `organic.''' It also offers a strict standard
defining what constitutes an organic food, a step that should do a
great deal to enhance consumer trust that a food labeled organic
really is organic.
</P>
<P>
   For raw products to be deemed 100 percent organic, for example,
they must be grown or manufactured without added hormones,
pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. The new rules do not reflect a
judgment on the relative safety or quality of organic foods as
compared with conventional foods. Rather, they govern marketing
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The department's response to the community of organic farmers
may herald a welcome new sensitivity to a sector of the farming
world that has suffered from official neglect. The Clinton
administration now needs to approve a final rule before it leaves
office. The Agriculture Department should take what it has learned
in developing these regulations _ especially the act of listening
intently to farmers _ and apply it to other programs that affect
small farmers. For their part, consumers and farmers should
recognize the power they wield when they work together.
