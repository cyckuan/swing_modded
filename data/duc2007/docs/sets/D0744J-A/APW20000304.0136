<HEADLINE> Organic Food Standards To Be Set  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans hunger for any food promoted as
natural, consuming $6 billion worth of products labeled organic,
often with no guarantee they actually were grown and processed
without synthetic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   That should change with the release, as early as Tuesday, of the
first national standards for organic food.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, expected to take effect this summer, will spell out
for the first time what it means for foods to be labeled organic.
They also will bar the use of genetically engineered crops or
irradiated ingredients in organic foods.
</P>
<P>
   Food grown and processed in accordance with those rules can
carry a seal of approval from the Agriculture Department, agency
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The rules ''give the consumers assurance that they've been
looking for that the products meet a set of standards that have
been enforced and that those standards are the same regardless of
the state it was grown in,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive
director of the Organic Trade Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will build consumer confidence in the label and certainly
will encourage sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the organic industry say the rules could lead
consumers into thinking organic products are safer or more
nutritious than conventional food. There is no evidence that is
true, said Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer
Research at the University of California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they will understand what organic means and make this
an informed choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic,
only 6,600 are approved by the 88 different state or private
certifying agencies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming. Eleven
others, including California, have production standards but no
certification process for ensuring that farmers comply with them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the industry has been growing at a rate of 20 percent
annually over the past decade. Sales are expected to reach $6
billion this year, according to the trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest food manufacturers are getting into
the natural-foods business, including General Mills Inc. and H.J.
Heinz Co. General Mills has a new organic cereal and announced in
December that it was buying Small Planet Foods, a leading producer
of organic food products.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the population eats organic products at least
occasionally, a recent ABC News Poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The organic market is likely to continue growing at a
double-digit pace for years to come, said David Nelson, a food
industry analyst with CS First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are buying food less as a staple or basic fuel and
more as an expression of lifestyle, like clothing or choice of car.
It's a niche market certainly, but rapidly growing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are expected to:
</P>
<P>
   --require that farmers go through a mandatory planning process
and have their practices certified by an approved state or private
agency.
</P>
<P>
   --restrict the pesticides, fertilizers and seed treatments they
can apply.
</P>
<P>
   --limit the kind of additives and packaging processors can use.
Banned will be additives like sulfites, nitrates or nitrite, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered national organic standards in 1990. Seven years
later, rules proposed by USDA were rejected by the industry because
they left open the possibility of allowing irradiated and
genetically engineered food and the use of sewage sludge as
fertilizer. Those possibilities have been ruled out in the new
proposals, said Andy Solomon, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and processors are expected to have 18 months to
comply; enforcement is left to states and private agencies approved
by USDA.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of national standards, foods claiming to be
organic are labeled in many different. Some list a certifying
agency, others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can charge more if it says organic and it may not be,''
said Jennifer Brenner, who was shopping Saturday at a Fresh Fields
natural foods store in Falls Church, Va. ''It's healthy whether
it's truly organic or not, but it would be nice to know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The store carried four varieties of organic apple sauce: One
claimed certification by ''OCIA,'' a reference to the Organic Crop
Improvement Association; a second was certified by Vermont Organic
Growers; a third cited a private California certifying agency,
Quality Assurance International; the label on Fresh Fields' house
brand simply said it was grown in accordance with California law.
