<HEADLINE> Consumers Ho-Hum Over Biotech Foods  </HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Europeans and Japanese don't want gene-altered
crops. Frito-Lay, McDonald's and Gerber have rejected them, too.
But grocers say American consumers don't seem to care one way or
the other -- at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a non-issue. They're not even thinking about it,'' said
Richard Ramsey, who runs a Piggly Wiggly supermarket in
Blountstown, Fla. ''I've not heard anything,'' said Dave Eber, who
manages a Marsh store in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   However, support for crops that produce genetically engineered
food is slipping, even if a majority of consumers still back the
technology, according to a poll released at the supermarket
industry's annual convention, which opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of shoppers surveyed in January said they
would be very or somewhat likely to buy a new variety of produce
that had been genetically engineered to resist insect damage.
That's down from 77 percent in a similar poll four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent said in January they were very or somewhat
likely to buy produce that was modified to taste better or stay
fresh longer, compared with 58 percent in 1996. The new survey,
conducted by Research International USA for the Food Marketing
Institute, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the poll's findings said ''consumers are less
inclined to purchase these products'' than they were in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government has approved approximately 50 varieties of
genetically engineered crops, and gene-altered soybeans and corn
can be found in foods throughout the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of this year's soybean crop and 20 percent of
this year's corn plantings will be of biotech varieties that are
resistant to a popular herbicide or insect pests. Biotech animals,
including leaner hogs and fast-growing salmon, are in development.
</P>
<P>
   A few food processors, including Frito-Lay and Gerber, have
stopped buying genetically engineered ingredients, citing fears
about consumer resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, however, don't realize how widely used these
so-called biotech ingredients have become, said Thomas Hoban, a
North Carolina State University sociologist who tracks consumer
attitudes about food. Nearly four in 10 questioned in the January
poll said they had heard nothing about biotech food.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, ''not only has the support for food and agricultural
biotechnology gone down but also support for medical biotechnology.
... The U.S. is maybe overly positive. It will swing down, maybe,''
Hoban said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who don't want to eat biotech food are expected to
provide a boost to the $6 billion-a-year organic industry. The lone
major grocery chain to reject biotech food so far is Whole Foods
Market, which focuses on natural foods and stands to gain if
consumers turn away from gene-altered products.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech food ''is not as much of an issue nationally as it will
become,'' said James Hopper, senior vice president of natural food
group operations for Tree of Life Inc. of St. Augustine, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are aware of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
and don't want to be exposed to GMOs will definitely go to
organic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agah, who designs supermarkets for the 97-store Save Mart
chain in northern California, isn't so sure. What matters most to
consumers is the price and appearance of their food, he said.
Organic food usually costs more than the conventional variety.
</P>
<P>
   ''They like to talk about (organic food), but they don't buy
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the biotech industry say there isn't enough known
about the possible environmental or health risks from genetically
altered plants and animals. They have been demanding tougher
testing standards and mandatory labeling of the products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration last week announced several steps
meant to assure the public that biotech food is safe, including a
more formal process for reviewing new products. But it said
mandatory labeling was not warranted. Food manufacturers fear such
labels would scare away consumers.
