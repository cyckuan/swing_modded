NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) - The Rwandan government has
launched a big campaign to ease water shortage rocking northeast
Rwanda, the Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday.

in Umutara was exacerbated by an unusual drought that hit the
disaster area because of a prolonged dry season.

Over three quarters of approximately 480,000 people in Umutara
prefecture are faced with severe drought.
