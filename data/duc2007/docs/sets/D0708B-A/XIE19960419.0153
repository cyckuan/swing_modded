<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hit by Severe Water Shortage </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is
going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply
with no sign of immediate improvement.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA)
said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million
liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand
of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the
obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for
WASA to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its
surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The onset of the summer heat has further drained the ground
water in Dhaka while adding to the sufferings of some 6 million
thirsty residents in the old city.
</P>
<P>
The officials held no optimism about an easy solution to the
problem before a new water treatment plant starts operation.
