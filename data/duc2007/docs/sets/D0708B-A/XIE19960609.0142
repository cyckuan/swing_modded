HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang province
will spend 7.1 billion yuan on building water supply projects to
meet the urban needs in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that the water shortage caused the
province's industrial output value to decrease by 3.6 billion yuan
last year, and people in a number of cities and counties are
short of drinking water supply.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the main reason for the water shortage
was inadequate government investment in building water supply
projects.
</P>
<P>
While increasing funds in constructing more water supply
facilities, the provincial government has decided to raise funds
through different channels including overseas investment for such
undertakings.
