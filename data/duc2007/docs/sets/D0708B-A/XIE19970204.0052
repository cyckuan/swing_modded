<HEADLINE> S. African Minister on Water Shortage </HEADLINE>

JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Could Run
Out of Water within 20 or 30 years if the current level of
consumption continues unrestricted, Water Affairs and Forestry
Minister Kader Asmal warned today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein, Asmal said South
Africa's capacity for social and economic development would be
seriously affected by the prospect of water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said his ministry is therefore reviewing the country's
current legislations on water issues and would soon start to
develop a national water management strategy to deal with the
issue.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a new water pricing policy is expected to be
in operation in the near future, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that irrigation sector of South Africa's
commercial farming in some provinces, especially the Free State
Province, would be affected by the new measures.
</P>
<P>
However, Asmal assured that the Free State would not be
deprived of its water resources if water is transferred from
Orange River to the Vaal Dam, a major water supplier of Gauteng
Province.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent study showed that there is more than enough
water available in the Orange River to meet the increasing demand
of all towns in the province, which are currently supplied from
this River.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Africa imposed temporary punitive water
tariff on residents in big cities such as Greater Johannesburg
owing to a short water supply of the Vaal Dam.
