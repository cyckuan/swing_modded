<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are searching
for ways to alleviate China's water shortage problems through new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The scientists are trying to improve water pollution treatment
technologies and increase reuse of water. Technologies have been
applied to treat industrial waste water discharged by paper making,
leather, food, dying, and oil-drilling sectors, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Ningyang County Paper Mill, a large plant in east China's
Shandong Province, will take the lead early this year in trying a
water pollution treatment technology approved by the State Science
and Technology Commission (SSTC).
</P>
<P>
The process will be implemented at paper mills across the
country in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Another project which will recycle 99 percent of water used in
oil exploration is being used in oil fields, Wen Jianping,
deputy-director of the China Research Center for Water Pollution
and Water Reuse under the SSTC, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project, developed by Wen's center, can treat 20,000 tons
of waste water daily.
</P>
<P>
Wen and his colleagues are working on recycling discharged
water from hotels, office buildings, car washes and public
washrooms.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the many countries in the world facing water
shortage, a situation plaguing more than 300 of its 660-odd
cities.
