<HEADLINE> Drought Causes Serious Water Shortage in Vietnam </HEADLINE>

HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Drought in Vietnam has caused a
serious water shortage affecting about 3 million people in the
recent months, Vietnam's English newspaper The Saigon Times Daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Le Huy Ngo, Vietnam's minister of agriculture
and rural development, as saying at a meeting Wednesday in Hanoi
to celebrate the international disaster relief day that "rainfall
in the past nine months in most of the country fell sharply."
</P>
<P>
Ngo said the drought has bad impact on agricultural production
not only in this year but also in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Mekong river water level is very low now, measured
at two meters early this month, the lowest level since 1926. If
the drought persists, a shortage of water for power generation and
cultivation will be unavoidable, Ngo added.
</P>
<P>
This year, the theme of the international disaster relief day
is "preventing calamities with information."
