<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The supply of water in the
Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight
days, the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage
problem in Luanda. He said that the government was short of money
to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get
rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
It is the 10th day today that water supply in Luanda has
suspended. Such a suspension of water supply resulted from the
cut-off of power supply to the water plant in the suburbs as
large rain fell down two high-voltage power supply towers.
