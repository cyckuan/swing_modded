NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will take measures to
tackle the severe warter shortage on this drought-hit eastern
Mediterranean island, a government statement said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Natural
Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous said the Cypriot
cabinet agreed last week to seek tenders for building two mobile
desalination plants due to be put into operation before next
summer.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has one desalination plant in Dhekelia on the eastern
coast, and the second is expected to be completed early next
century.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that water supplies could run out by the
end of the year due to the extended drought.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would do everything possible to
solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
"We will also investigate the possibility of importing water
from abroad as an alternative," Themistocleous said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will study the feasibility of
introducing higher charges on water as a step to promote water
saving.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has also planned to encourage people to use water-saving
devices and systems for recycling "grey water" for use in toilets
and garden irrigation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also provide financial support
to repair water pipe networks in towns and villages, he added.
