DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- People living in Bangladesh's
capital city of Dhaka are suffering from a shortage of drinking
water, media reports Wednesday quoted official sources as saying.

<P>
Daily demand for water in the city with a population of over 9
million is around 1.4 billion liters, and there is a shortfall of
640 million liters, according to the sources.

<P>
The Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority supplies drinking water
to the city dwellers through a total of 97 deep tube wells and a
lone water treatment plant.

<P>
A shortfall usually rises during the summer season when load
sheddings are more frequent than in the winter season.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the system loss of water is about 50 percent due to
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The daily demand for water in the city would rise to 1.8
billion liters a day by the year 2000, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of water in the city would be partially eased with
the completion of the World Bank-aided 175-million-U.S.-dollar
Sayedabad water treatment project, the sources added.
