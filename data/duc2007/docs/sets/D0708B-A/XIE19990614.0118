<HEADLINE> Water Shortage to Deteriorate in Pakistani Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Water shortage in the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad is expected to deteriorate as water reservoir
can meet demand of the consumers just for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of
Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be
used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Simli dam has been declining over the past
four months due to lack of rainfall, which has caused concern and
panic among the residents in the capital who have experienced
similar situation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Failing to cope with the water shortage, the Capital
Development Authority has resorted to further reduction in water
supply to the residents who are already complaining of
non-availability of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the authority said that they have further reduced
water supply in a bid to use the reservoir for as many days as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authority has repeatedly called on the people to
use water carefully and not to waste it.
</P>
<P>
Some residents are complaining that those people who installed
moter pumps directly on main water pipeline are depriving their
neighbors to get ample water supply.
</P>
<P>
If the crisis is allowed to continue, many residents will
prefer to migrate from the capital as they cannot afford to live
without water during scorching summer, said one resident.
