<HEADLINE> China's Water Crisis Blamed on Waste and Pollution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In northwestern China, which has half of the country's land,
arable land has become increasingly desertified and sandstorms
have become more frequent because of improper use of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
And in the Southwest and North, karst formations can be an
important source of water for many cities, but people have to
attach importance to ground subsidence caused by the excessive use
of water.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told the
symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical
way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects,
which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of
water resources. She said that diverting water from one area to
another may benefit some areas for a short period of time, but the
ecological damaged will have serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
The two academics have asked the central government to pay more
attention to developing subterranean water instead of surface
water, because it is the major water resource in many cities and
is less likely to be polluted.
</P>
<P>
China should try to build a nationwide water monitoring system
to provide accurate data for the healthy development of water
resources and should increase pollution controls, one Finnish
scientist suggested.
