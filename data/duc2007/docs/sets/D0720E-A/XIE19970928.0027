<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentary Union Denounces Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus-based Arab
Parliamentary Union (APU) today denounced Israel's policy of
settlement, describing it as a serious challenge to the
foundations and principles of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the Arab Parliamentary Union
in the Syrian capital today.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that it plans to make new settlements in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem and to construct 300 more residential
units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plans are continuation of Israeli Prime Minister's Benjamin
Netanyahu's policy of Judaizing the Holy City of Jerusalem and
altering its Arab-Islamic identity, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to encircle the Arab cities with a belt of the
Jewish settlements, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N.
resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and
the will of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The APU called on parliamentarians of all over the world to
urge their governments to exert all types of pressure on Israel to
abandon this peace-destroying policy.
</P>
<P>
The APU pointed out that it is an international responsibility
to save the Mideast peace process by compelling Israel to abandon
its policy of settlement and to declare its commitment to the
principles of the peace process, particularly the land-for-peace
principle.
