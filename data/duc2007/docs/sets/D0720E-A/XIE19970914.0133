<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Rally Celebrates Fourth Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 Israeli peace
activists gathered in Tel Aviv overnight to celebrate the fourth
anniversary of the signing of Oslo Accords and protest the Likud
government's policies.
</P>
<P>
The rally, held in the Museum Plaza, was organized by
activists of the opposition Labor, Meretz and Hadash parties and
the peace movement Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by former Labor's former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, Labor leader Ehud Barak, Meretz head Yossi Sarid and Leah
Rabin, widow of the slain Labor Premier Yitzhak Rabin, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bearing banners reading "Returning to Rabin's path" and "Save
the peace," the demonstrators demanded the current Likud
government act to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rally strongly attacked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's policies that have put
the peace process in danger. Organizers handed out stickers that
read, "What have you done today to topple the government?"
</P>
<P>
"Peace will overcome the delusions of this regime, Oslo will
not die," Peres said in his speech. "Four years ago peace was born
in Oslo. In the last year and a quarter Netanyahu's government has
tried to break Oslo. Oslo was no mistake, the Netanyahu government
is the big mistake."
</P>
<P>
Barak blasted Netanyahu's policies for "leading us on the path
of Bosnia and Belfast," warning that the next war is already
waiting for the Israeli people behind the door.
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is on the wall and only the blind or members
of the government are unable to read it," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
A roar of applause rose from the crowd when Sarid said "Bibi,
go home."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Quria (Abu Ala)
sent a letter to the rally, calling on Israeli peace activists to
join with the Palestinian people in seeking peace.
</P>
<P>
"In this flameless and lightless period, let us join hands and
together firmly grip the torch of peace. Together let us breath
new life into this process and rebuild trust and recreate an
atmosphere where confidence between our peoples prevails so that
we both realize our common dream in this land of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the historical signing of the Declaration of Principles
in Washington four years ago that formally triggered off the Oslo
peace process, named for the Norwegian capital where peace was
initiated in secret meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, the process, which has borne fruits including the
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza Strip and West Bank, received a
severe blow when the hardline Likud government came to power in
Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continuation of settlement activities, land
confiscation and delay in troop redeployments have virtually
halted the whole process and led to renewed tensions with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Even a much-awaited visit by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here last week failed to break the deadlock,
that was caused by Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement in
East Jerusalem since March and was aggravated by a recent wave of
suicide bombings launched by Islamic militants in
Jerusalem.
