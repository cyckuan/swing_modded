COMMENTARY: THE ACCIDENTAL PEACENIK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For the first time in Israel's history, its upcoming election is
about who will control the Interior Ministry, not the Foreign
Ministry. It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more
responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly
advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down
the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to
the peace process. It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal
with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist. It is
no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian
state while Likud rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75
percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a
Palestinian state of some size or other. With that sort of
consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign
Ministry?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall
between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two
sides. He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while
all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters
that he was not abandoning their cause. It may have been that the
only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without
triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying,
blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and ``the
leftists,'' and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up
to his commitments or not. Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to
as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo _ and he accommodated
them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who
delivered it.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought
a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process _ but he
stayed out of it himself. That is, he never wanted to take
ownership of it, and he still doesn't. Bibi struck important deals
that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs
against him in this election. In 1996, Bibi won because a majority
of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and
the blowing up of Israeli buses.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better
Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept
Oslo. In other words, thanks to Bibi's having routinized the peace
process, many Israelis want to get on with it, finish it and look
to the future.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of leading that parade, Netanyahu is shying away
from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past. He
repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up
in Jerusalem. Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process,
he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future. His
campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope, and when you
can't give hope, when you cannot educate, when you cannot
articulate people's aspirations, when you cannot unify, you cannot
lead.
</P>
<P>
   I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded
identical themes, although neither knows the other. One was from a
religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron
Yaacov, Victor Friedman (no relation). Victor wrote: ``Even people
who hate the left, and can't imagine voting for Ehud Barak, are
tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since
Bibi came to power. The lying, trickery, corruption, divisiveness,
incitement _ people don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer, Laura Blumenfeld,
who wrote that Israel today is suffering from ``Multiple Israel
Disorder _ Bibi thought he could hold onto power by dividing
everyone into squabbling tribes. He was wrong. The shot that killed
Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions. But
after three years of bumping and biting each other's necks, people
are tired.''
</P>
<P>
   By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace,
Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never
before. But by doing it in such a divisive fashion, he has also
created a longing for national unity as never before _ a longing
that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy. On Monday we will
find out if Bibi can survive Bibism.
