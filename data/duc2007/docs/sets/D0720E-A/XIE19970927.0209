<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and
sanctions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian TV program "Beit Al Arab"
broadcast today, Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or
respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted
that he ignores the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
His criticism came two days after the Israeli government has
decided to build more homes in Efrat settlement in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced Wednesday night that his government will
continue to bolster the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
plans to build 300 homes in the Efrat settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat slammed Israel's economic sanctions against the
Palestinian self-rule areas, which has caused many Palestinians
vulnerable to starvation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians lose 9 to 10 million U.S. dollars
every day due to the closure imposed by Israel after two multiple
suicide bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the PNA-ruled areas, Arafat said
that Albright has reaffirmed the principles based on the United
Nations Security Council resolutions, the land for peace formula,
and the peace accords signed between the PNA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. stance is positive, yet it needs practical
steps to confront the Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Following Israeli decision to expand the Efrat settlement,
Albright criticized it as inconsistent to the kind of climate for
negotiations that she wanted to create.
