<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accept Delay in Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have accepted a two-
week postponement in the implementation of a promised further
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Voice of Palestine radio
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (also known as Abu Ala),
head of the Palestinian team to the so-called back-channel talks
with Israel, told the radio that the Palestinians have agreed to
the delay in the Israeli pull-out, initially scheduled to be
carried out by June 23.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator on interim affairs, Saeb Erekat,
told the radio that the United States had echoed the Israeli
request for such a delay. The scheduled Israeli withdrawal was a
main issue in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton last week in Washington, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat noted that what the Palestinians want is an assurance
from the U.S. that the Israeli third withdrawal from the West Bank,
outlined in the Oslo accords signed by the two sides in 1993, would
be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Israel had threatened that if the Palestinian side rejects its
demand for the postponement and insists on the withdrawal being
carried out on time, it will stick to a previous government
decision that the third withdrawal will cover only 1 percent of the
West Bank territories. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining
West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third
redeployment. Israel so far has handed over full or partial control
of about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how many of the West Bank territories would
be included in the third withdrawal, despite press reports that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to hand over 90 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.
