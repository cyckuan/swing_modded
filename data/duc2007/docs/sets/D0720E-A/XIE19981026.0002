<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Interim Deal Unlike Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim
deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords,
which he said were not good agreements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day
stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal did
provide security guarantee for Israel while being required to
relinquish lands to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak
Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground
for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of
"land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for
the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to
fulfill their security commitment before Israel hands over part of
the West Bank to them.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the best he could have been achieved under the
current circumstance.
</P>
<P>
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of
bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye
Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim
agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu,
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
