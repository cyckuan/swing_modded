<HEADLINE> PLO Central Council Begin Discussing Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council started its discussions here
Tuesday on the issue of the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over the meeting,
which was held at the Presidential Office and attended by over 100
council members. The council has 124 members.
</P>
<P>
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
attended the meeting as observers. Representatives from other
Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would
announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the
teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian
self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo
Accords.
</P>
<P>
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are
demonstrating in front of the office, urging the council and
Arafat not to postpone the declaration of statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo
principles, he has the right to declare an independent
Palestinian state on that date. For this purpose, he traveled
recently to many countries to seek their support and advise over
this matter.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank territories now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to
declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set
themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement
within in a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter
to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the
announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help
move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement
the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring
Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after
Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to
help reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but
the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are
anxiously to see what decision the council would make on the
statehood issue.
