EILAT (ISRAEL), April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators opened another round of final-status talks in Israel's
southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Sunday, in an effort to
reach a framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Abbo headed their respective negotiating
teams to the talks, the third intensive one with the involvement of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is
scheduled to join next Tuesday the current talks, which will last
till May 12.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have already held two rounds of intensive talks
since March 21 with the involvement of the United States at Bolling
Air Base near Washington, the United States, but no substantial
progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed last September in
Egypt, the two sides have to reach a framework agreement on final-
status by February 15 and a final-status peace accord by September
13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
But due to slow progress in the talks, Israel has suggested the
two sides reach the framework agreement in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The final-status issues that the two sides have to tackle
include the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian
entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two sides also have to decide on the last Israeli
troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Oslo accords signed
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israel has already handed over about 43 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. Israel has to transfer the remaining
West Bank territories except some military zones and Jewish
settlements to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.
