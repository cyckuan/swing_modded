<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Opposition to Netanyahu's Call for Madrid II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
reaffirmed Sunday that Egypt opposes Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin's proposal for holding a Madrid II international
conference on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing called `Madrid II'," Moussa was quoted by the
Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the idea put forward by Netanyahu for
convening a multilateral conference to tackle all regional issues
but not the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock specifically.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Saturday on the Spanish newspaper
ABC, Netanyahu said he believed that peace talks held along the
lines of the 1991 Madrid peace conference would be "useful" to
solve the regional problems, such as water distribution and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
But he did not want the conference to tackle specifically the
Israeli-Palestinian peace stalemate, arguing that negotiations on
bilateral levels are being held with the U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to
annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference
and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid conference, which brought Israelis and Arabs to
face-to-face talks for the first time, formulated the the landmark
land-for-peace principle and the framework for bilateral and
multilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated that there is no need at present to hold a
Madrid II conference since the 1991 Madrid conference has already
laid the main bases for the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat noted that there is now an
Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference
to deal with the crisis created by the present Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the proposed conference is "not to
renegotiate the principles of Madrid conference," rather to call
on the parties to implement these principles.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to France in May, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac jointly proposed
the holding of an international conference to discuss the current
peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Cairo
Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flatly rejected
Netanyahu's Madrid II idea, warning that this could blast the
whole peace process.
