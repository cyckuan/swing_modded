<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot, apparently
relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped
private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998,
according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who
did not have a more precise date Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Public records show that he was still a flight student in
December 1997. He apparently did not have an instrument rating,
meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that
required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on
Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
</P>
<P>
   The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said,
because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds
the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April. A
pilot who flies from the same airfield, Essex Airport in Fairfield,
N.J., said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor, and
that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha's
Vineyard on Friday nights, and returned on Sunday nights or Monday
mornings. The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the
Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year,
said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement
Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport. About 350
planes are registered there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw
the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another
woman was wearing a beige dress, he said. (Other reports said that
Ms. Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot
said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot.'' He had what appeared
from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other
pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals. It was not
clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have
affected his ability to control the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their
mutual instructor. ``He always said he had an instructor fly with
him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot. ``He may have been
getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his
skills, even though he had the license.'' Aviation experts said he
might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good
time'' flying with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to
take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar
Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control
office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
</P>
<P>
   But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the
flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for
spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if
he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under
no obligation to check in. Private planes commonly do not fly under
air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically
responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity
and altitude. But for private flights like this one, the
transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was
a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity. FAA
technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the
previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said. The Saratoga
can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front,
each of whom has flight controls. The plane has a single,
300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine
in a large car. It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people,
baggage and fuel. It carries about 100 gallons of fuel. List price
on new Saratogas is $419,000 for the base model, with various
options available.
</P>
<P>
   Small private airplanes typically do not carry cockpit voice
recorders or flight data recorders, but accident investigators can
usually determine from the wreckage such questions as whether the
propeller was intact and rotating at impact, and whether the plane
broke up in flight. Radar can also give useful information,
including the path of the descent.
