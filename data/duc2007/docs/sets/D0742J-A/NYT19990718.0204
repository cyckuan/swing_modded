PHYSICAL CLUES LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT   ABOUT PLANE'S FATE

   A wheel. A headrest. A piece of support. As the weekend wore on,
the different pieces of airplane that washed ashore on Martha's
Vineyard were the sole physical clues to the fate of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s flight.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and
the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it
disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact:
that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has
come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and
lawyer who specializes in air crash cases. ``It's no longer a
single airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into
the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have
given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no
longer generates upward lift. The nose points downward as the plane
begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
</P>
<P>
   To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try
to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's
Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's
calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this
before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per
minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len
Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and
sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said. In similar
crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating
wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he
said. And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where
Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more
difficult. From above the water's surface, it is hard to see
objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could
take months and that the cause of the crash might never be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what
could have gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative
inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy,
moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful
plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane
malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot
error.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight
could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a
malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds
information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the
plane's gyroscopic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction
of various components,'' Wolk said. Kennedy's plane may have
crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than
pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical things don't happen a lot,'' he said. ``Most of
it's something a pilot does.''
