FOR KENNEDY, A CHALLENGING FLIGHT IN A NEWER AIRCRAFT

<P>
   Visibility wasn't optimal. He wasn't licensed to fly using
instruments only, and some fellow pilots suggest he should have
brought a flight instructor. He had just upgraded to a more
powerful and complicated plane.
</P>
<P>
   But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard
Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good pilot and as familiar with this airport as
someone of his experience could be,'' said Arthur Marx, chief pilot
for Flywright Aviation at Martha's Vineyard Airport, where Kennedy
and his first plane, a Cessna Skyline 182, were seen frequently
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy purchased his new plane _ a 1996 model Piper Saratoga II
TC, a 300-horsepower, single-engine six-seater _ in April for an
estimated $300,000. It was originally used by a private North
Carolina company, then by Munir Hussain of Hasbrouck, N.J., who
sold it to Kennedy through a broker. Government and company records
indicate no history of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy learned to fly at Flight Safety International in
Lakeland, Fla., and obtained his basic pilot's license two years
ago. Since then, fellow pilots estimate he probably logged at least
200 hours of flying time _ not a rookie, but not deeply experienced
_ in smaller, less powerful planes such as the Cessna. Then he
``traded up'' to the Saratoga, doubtless looking for more carrying
capacity and power, fellow pilots say.
</P>
<P>
   The Saratoga has state-of-the-art equipment, including an
automatic pilot. It also has a second fuel tank that the pilot must
remember to select to avert disaster. ``You're very busy in the
cockpit,'' said Myron Goulian, head of Executive Flyers Aviation in
Bedford, Mass., a 35-year-old family-owned flight school. ``That
might have been a little bit too much plane for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goulian also questioned why Kennedy took off Friday evening from
the airport in New Jersey in the first place. Pilots were reporting
poor visibility due to haze, he said. Kennedy was not licensed to
fly using instruments only, did not have a flight instructor
accompanying him and may have had an injured foot as well _
although one N.J.-based pilot, Larry Lorenzo, said Kennedy could
have operated the rudder pedals on the plane fairly easily. ``If he
could walk, he could fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also didn't file a flight plan with authorities, though
he was not required to, and did not ask for a private service that
tracks private flights, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have been in the air, in my opinion. He should
have been at home or in a bus or a train,'' Goulian said. ``That
was a bad judgment call, to leave, especially that late at night.
From what I hear it was a horrible night.''
</P>
<P>
   The less-than-perfect visibility conditions _ known in flying
parlance as ``marginal VFR (visual flight rules),'' made Kennedy's
trip more challenging than normal, agreed Warren Morningstar,
director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, a general aviation lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots under those conditions would have ``a more difficult time
discerning the horizon. The ability to see the horizon, or having a
view of the ground, is needed for spatial oreintation to keep the
plane upright,'' Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the more powerful aircraft, Goulian said, ``you just
adjust to the performance capability of the airplane, and you need
the experience level to keep up with it. It's great as long as
you're ahead of the airplane. Some pilots jump from a 90 m.p.h
training airplane to a 220 m.p.h. plane that's very slippery and
high-performance, and they get through that phase. Others don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar said the Saratoga ``is not the sort of plane you
would want to learn to fly in, but it should not be a handful for a
low-time pilot who had proper training in the aircraft. They are
very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really easy to fly. My 6-year-old son can and has kept
it flying straight,'' said Michael Danziger, a Lincoln, Mass. pilot
who owns a Saratoga and flies frequently to the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has sophisticated avionics including GPS, or global
positioning system, which would enable Kennedy to be sitting on the
ground in Caldwell, N.J., plug in Martha's Vineyard and get the
distance and compass heading he should target. Among other things,
GPS can tell a pilot where the nearest airport is in case of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The plane also has an autopilot, that with the press of two
buttons, will keep the craft at a designated altitude and heading,
and by moving a dial on a compass, the pilot can turn the plane
even though the auto pilot is still engaged.
