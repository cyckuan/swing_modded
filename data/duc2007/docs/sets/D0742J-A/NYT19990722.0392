<P>
   CHILMARK, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister
died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's
investigation continues. One source close to the probe said that
all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up,
including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including
plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a
wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it
hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but
died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts
Chief Medical Examiner Richard J. Evans. After an examination that
occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that
all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators would not comment further on the condition of
the bodies or the details of coroner's report. And they would not
say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering
question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July
16.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is
usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in
forensic pathology said Thursday. The cause of death is generally
known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the
cause of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed
especially quickly, pathologists said. The remains were taken to a
Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released
to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical
examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said
Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook
County, Ill. The haste in this case, he said, could lead to
questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so
are the risks of carelessness. He pointed to other ``autopsies
associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation
that followed President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the
questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago,
in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as
Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let . . .those kinds of pressures alter your
routines,'' he said. ``If you alter your procedure and do things
differently, then you're always going to run into problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri
counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45
minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine
whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain
rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for
the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign
of what the pilot was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the
testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said. After every
plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send
investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to
collect a series of specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix
said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine
the victims' injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a
victim's family sues for damages related to the crash. A medical
examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments
before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes
it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact
that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local
district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual
intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the
burial. Officials were especially reluctant to give out information
on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
</P>
<P>
   Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical
and reasonable, Kirschner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he
said. ``Because when you're too deferential, you're not thinking of
the things you should be thinking of.''
