<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard incurred costs totaling  
$287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The search and rescue effort began early Saturday morning and  
ended when it became clear that Kennedy's plane had crashed into 
the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	That initial search involved patrol boats, helicopters and other  
aircraft stationed along the East Coast, including bases in Cape 
Cod, Mass.; Montauk, N.Y; Newport, R.I.; and Woods Hole, Mass., 
according to Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs include fuel, maintenance and salaries and were  
covered by the Coast Guard's annual congressional appropriation for 
operating expenses, Lapinski said.
