	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new
safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic
edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether
anything has really changed.
	   On Sunday, both newspapers and ordinary Iranians debated the
announcement made in New York Thursday by Iran's foreign minister
distancing his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
Rushdie's death.
	   The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling
for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
	   ``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and
has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic. There is no room for
optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
	   The Iran News, a moderate daily close to the foreign ministry,
said there was nothing new in Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's
statement that his ``government disassociates itself from any
reward ... and does not support it.'' It pointed out that the
government's position has for several years been not to seek
Rushdie's death.
