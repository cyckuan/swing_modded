Foreign secretary meets Rushdie

	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met Salman Rushdie
for private discussions Friday.
	   The Foreign Office declined to say anything about the meeting,
stressing that it was private.
	   Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when
the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed
that the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' should be killed.
	   Last month, Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in
New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself
from rewards offered for Rushdie's death.
	   However, on Monday a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8
million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.
