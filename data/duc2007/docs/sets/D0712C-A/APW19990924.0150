<HEADLINE> Rushdie: Life Better Without Fatwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIEGE, Belgium (AP) -- Salman Rushdie says his life has improved  
since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not 100 percent normal, but compared to what the last 10  
years have been like, it is better,'' the ``Satanic Verses'' author 
said at a news conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the lifting of the death sentence would allow him to  
focus on being a novelist rather than the center of a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer was in Liege to receive an honorary doctorate in  
literature from Liege University.
