Salman Rushdie free to visit India, says interior minister
</HEADLINE>

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Author Salman Rushdie is welcome to
visit India, but the government is not ready to lift the ban on his
book, The Satanic Verses, India's minister for internal security
said in an interview published Saturday.
	   ``He is an outstanding writer and is welcome to return home,''
The Times of India quoted Lal Krishna Advani as saying.
	   Advani's statement came nearly two weeks after Rushdie
complained in an interview that he was banned from entering India.
He was born in Bombay.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Iran's late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989, claiming
``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
	   Last month, the Iranian government distanced itself from offers
by Iranian groups to pay money to execute the edict. But a
foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who
kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
	   India was the first country in the world to ban ``The Satanic
Verses'' after it provoked angry protests from the Muslim community
in 1988.
	   In 1996, Rushdie's book ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' was withdrawn
from bookshelves within weeks of its release in India after
directions from Indian customs.
