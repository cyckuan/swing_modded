Iranian villagers offer reward for killing Rushdie

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Residents of a village in northern Iran have
offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman
Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The people of Kiapey will give 10 carpets, 4,500 sq. meters
(5,400 sq. yards) of agricultural land and a house with a 1500 sq.
meter (1,800 sq. yard) garden in their Caspian Sea coastal village
to Rushdie's assassin, the Farsi-language paper Kayhan said.
	   The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last
month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong
reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker
Prize-winning author.
	   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual
leader of the Islamic republic, condemned Rushdie to death in 1989,
ruling that his book, ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
	   The villagers have also invited the parents of Mustapha Mazeh,
who blew himself up while working on a home-made bomb in a London
hotel in 1989, to live in Kiapey, which has a population of 2,000
and is near Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province.
	   Iranians believe Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin,
intended to kill Rushdie, but British police have dismissed this
theory.
	   Last week, a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
And hard-liners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of
the death sentence.
	   The government said last month it did not support the bounty
and, after a meeting between their foreign ministers in New York on
Sept. 24, Britain and Iran decided to upgrade their relations to
ambassadorial level.
