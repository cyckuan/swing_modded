   LONDON _ British Airways said Friday that it would not permit
the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's
assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have every sympathy with Rushdie's difficulties with
overseas travel,'' said Bruce Tobin, a spokesman for the airline,
``our ultimate responsibility is the safety of our passengers and
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie has made many overseas trips since 1989, when the death
sentence, in the form of a religious edict, was issued against him.
But not once has he flown on British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain close contact with the relevant authorities in all
matters that might affect the safety and security of our
passengers,'' Tobin said. ``Mr. Rushdie is not a British Airways
customer.''
