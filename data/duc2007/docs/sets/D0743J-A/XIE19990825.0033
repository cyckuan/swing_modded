<HEADLINE> Overall Death Toll Reaches 17,997 in Turkish Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the monster
earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on
Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting.
</P>
<P>
In the face of threats ranging from a typhoid epidemic to lack
of shelters under heavy rains, the survivors are seized with
depression, especially while seeing bulldozers ripping into the
heaps of rubble which have become the graves of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
As the estimated 200,000 survivors have turned into refugees,
Turkish officials broadcast appeals on Tuesday for everything from
 tents to bulldozers to help begin rebuilding living shattered by
the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
However, more immediate medical worries began to emerge as
the death toll reached some 18,000.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Ministry Crisis Administration Center stated Tuesday
that the regional coordination center established in Izmit,
epicenter of the devastating earthquake, will start operations
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, education and entertainment facilities in the
affected regions, and in neighboring provinces, were evacuated and
prepared for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to urgently purchase 150 ambulances
and all necessary measures have been taken to prevent any kind of
failure in telephone lines, especially when Turkey is facing bad
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains lashed the quake-stricken regions for a second
day. The muddy quagmires left by the downpours increased fears
of disease from mosquitoes and flies attracted by the
foul-smelling pools.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of decaying bodies are believed to be still buried
under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military decided to cancel the four-day Victory
Day celebrations set to begin on Thursday, marking the Turkish
expulsion of other forces in 1922.
</P>
<P>
Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4
killer quake struck western Turkey.
