   SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the
devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific
journal in 1997. It might have been just a lucky guess. Still, if
it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
</P>
<P>
   In the scientific article, two U.S. Geological Survey
researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a
small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western
port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault,
within the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles
south of Izmit. Early indications are that the epicenter was on the
Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault
system.
</P>
<P>
   The article, published in Geophysical Research International and
titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since
1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS
researchers Ross S. Stein and James H. Dieterich and Aykut A. Barka
of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we
described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday. ``This
earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim
that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned
only a 12 percent probability to it.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their
study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes. Since
1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian
Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with
each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists
described it.
</P>
<P>
   The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is
unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat,
domino-style pattern of occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress
in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in
that region.
</P>
<P>
   According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake
immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could
eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
</P>
<P>
   On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article
that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for
a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967
quake.
</P>
<P>
   They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring
at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan. The
Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky
guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm
of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in
triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer
models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either
triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake
of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said. ``The 1906 earthquake
was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault
in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday. As a result, for most of
the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise,
compared with the shaky 19th century.
