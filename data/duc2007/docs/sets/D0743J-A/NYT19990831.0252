   IZMIT, Turkey _ A strong tremor shook already devastated towns
in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, bringing several buildings
crashing down and causing at least one death.
</P>
<P>
   It was the strongest tremor to hit the area since the shattering
earthquake of Aug. 17, which killed more than 14,000 people.
Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are
homeless as a result of that quake.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's tremor, which shook the Earth back and forth for about
10 seconds, struck shortly after 11 a.m. and was followed by an
aftershock about 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor
measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the
aftershock measured 4.6. Seismologists with the U.S. Geological
Survey put the strength slightly higher at 5.4 for Tuesday's
initial tremor and 4.7 for the aftershock.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Izmit, where many homeless families are living in tents
and railway boxcars, 166 people were admitted to hospitals and
clinics after being hit by debris.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old man was killed when masonry fell on him as he was
fleeing a building that had been weakened in the Aug. 17 quake.
Seven buildings were reported to have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   A man broke his leg in the town of Adapazari when he jumped from
the third floor of a swaying building. The local governor sent
aides into the streets with loudspeakers to urge residents not to
panic.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was one of the
hardest hit by the Aug. 17 quake, which had a magnitude measured at
7.4, Tuesday's tremor sent people racing away from blocks of
already weakened buildings. Many buildings shook, but none fell.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's tremor was also felt in some parts of Istanbul, which
is about 65 miles from the apparent epicenter near Izmit. Dishes
rattled in some homes, and desks shook in one of the few schools
where the academic year had already begun.
</P>
<P>
   But in Istanbul as in other areas, the main effect was
psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it doesn't do more damage, I don't like it,'' said
Yusuf Ozkul, a carpenter in Golcuk who lost his home in the earlier
quake and who is now living in a tent beside the Sea of Marmara.
``It makes me nervous, because I've seen what these things can do.
I hate it when the ground shakes, even if it only shakes a
little.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The tremor struck minutes after J. Brady Anderson, administrator
of the U.S. Agency for International Development, left Golcuk after
a tour of the devastated area.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted with several survivors living in tents. They
expressed gratitude for the American relief aid and said their
greatest need now was housing. The weather in this part of Turkey
usually turns cold around mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has announced that she
will visit Turkey on Sunday. She will be in the region on a tour of
Middle Eastern capitals and added Turkey to her itinerary at the
last moment.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Prosecutors in the town of Duzce, on the eastern edge of the
devastated area, issued warrants for the arrest of 33 contractors,
engineers and building owners.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with using low-quality concrete, weak
reinforcing rods and shoddy construction techniques that led to the
fatal collapses of their buildings in the Aug. 17 quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a construction engineer for 30 years, and I've never
seen reinforcing rods that are completely smooth like the ones I
saw here,'' said Fred Stolaski, a relief worker from Florida. ``I
didn't even know they still made them.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One Turkish contractor who is being sought by police, Veli
Gucer, gave a telephone interview to the German newspaper Bild am
Sonntag. Gucer, who spoke from an undisclosed location, built a
large apartment complex in the seaside town of Yalova in which
several hundred people are believed to have perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for me to have a guilty conscience,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``Naturally I sympathize with the victims and
their families, but I don't understand why I'm being made a
scapegoat. I began building the Bahcekent complex in Yalova about
six years ago. Naturally I didn't know much about the business. I
studied literature in school. I'm a poet, not a structural
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember visiting my first construction site. I saw workers
using beach sand to make concrete. When I asked about it, the
architect told me it was completely normal. Only later did I learn
that this is a completely wrong and dangerous technique. So I gave
the order to stop doing such a disgusting thing. Unfortunately,
half the complex was already finished by then.''
