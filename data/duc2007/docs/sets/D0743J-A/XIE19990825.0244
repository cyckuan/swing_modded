<HEADLINE> Hospitals Seethed With Quake Victims in Turkey </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISTANBUL, August 25 (Xinhua) -- More than a week after the
August 17 killer earthquake in northwestern Turkey, people with
quake-related injuries were still flooding to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and
Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related
diseases surpassed 4,100.
</P>
<P>
Quake survivors with injured heads, broken arms and legs
overflew the 120 private and 38 state hospitals in the
metropolis. Nearly half of the patients in Istanbul's hospitals
are suffering from bone fractures.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were sent here by ambulances or helicopters from
other quake-hit areas where public hospitals were demolished and
the makeshift field hospitals, set up by medical staff from
internal or foreign countries, did not have necessary facilities
to deal with some serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
In a number of state hospitals, the personnel had to go
without sleep for 40 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were treated for minor injuries and then
discharged.
</P>
<P>
Some of the survivors, who had been buried under rubble for
days and were rescued recently, had developed kidney problems due
to lack of water.
</P>
<P>
Medical conditions were tougher in other quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In Adapazari, about 130 kilometers east of Istanbul, several
field hospitals were operating along with a public hospital which
was half-ruined in the quake but returned to partial functioning
lately.
</P>
<P>
In a field hospital by a busy intersection, a woman doctor said
she and her colleges, all volunteer medical personnel from
surrounding areas like Istanbul, Izmit, Bolu or Yalova, were
working here in clinic tents in groups of three persons. They
would be working for three-four days non-stop before being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
Due to limitations of medical facilities, some patients were
transferred to the nearby Israeli military field hospital which
was better equipped. Those patients who were beyond the treatment
were sent to Istanbul or the Turkish capital of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Another doctor said he and his two colleges in a tent had
received over 70 patients since eight o'clock in the morning through
afternoon.
