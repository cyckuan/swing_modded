<HEADLINE> Geologist: 2 Quakes Hit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The earthquake that struck western  
Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a 
leading geologist said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prof. Aykut Barka of Istanbul Technical University said the  
tremors were 20 seconds apart, and their epicenter was near the 
northwestern town of Izmit, 90 miles east of Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two quakes lasted about 45 seconds at 3 a.m.  
Tuesday, Barka told the private NTV television station. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll in the 7.4-magnitude quake has surpassed 12,000  
and some officials have predicted as many as 40,000 could have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Several U.S. and European seismologists have arrived in Turkey  
to study the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey  
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it is 
common for large earthquakes to occur in multiple surges in rapid 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every earthquake bigger than a 6-point magnitude is a  
multiple event,'' he said. ``It's almost impossible to break a 
chunk of rock that long in one instance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the last 20 years has technology allowed scientists to  
detect multiple events in a major quake, he said.
