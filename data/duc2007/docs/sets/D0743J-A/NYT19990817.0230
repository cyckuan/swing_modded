   Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said
the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a
devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago
as a particularly dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   A team of MIT scientists has been studying the region for a
decade, but said new equipment now being installed to monitor the
fault's motion, which might have provided enough warning to save
some of the estimated 2,000 people who died, was not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
   The quake's center near the town of Izmit was on a stretch of
the North Anatolian fault where the MIT team, working with
scientists from Turkish universities and the nation's science
foundation, ``marked it two years ago as an area to be watched
closely,'' said M. Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of
geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in
Turkey since 1971. ``I have walked just about every foot of that
fault zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the
quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings
in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left
more than 100,000 homeless. The damage is expected to run to
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, the MIT-Turkish team has been monitoring
the motion of the ground along both sides of the fault line using
one of the world's most advanced networks of GPS (Global
Positioning System) satellite receivers, which can pinpoint
locations to within one-tenth of an inch. It was readings from
these instruments that showed that ``this was the region where most
of the stresses were accumulating,'' Toksoz said.
</P>
<P>
   But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new
system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position
information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.
But only one station is operational.
</P>
<P>
   If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said,
``we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some
warning.'' That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes
to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough
time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to
store water and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued,
Toksoz said. But the only similar networks of monitoring stations
in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have
shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists
have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have detected precursor motions,'' Toksoz said, ``but
not in real time.'' With the added impetus of this quake, he said,
``we'll push on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said earthquakes have been gradually migrating westward along
the North Anatolian fault, as stress builds up in the rock and is
then released. The largest earthquake ever recorded on the fault
was a magnitude 8.2 quake in 1939, which killed 20,000 people, and
there have been six other quakes greater than magnitude 7 since
then, each spanning a 60- to 100-mile segment of the fault.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, with a population of 12
million, lies just 65 miles west of Izmit, and may be the next
place to feel the fault's wrath. The fault line, which closely
resembles California's San Andreas fault, passes just a few miles
from the city. Geologists call both faults right-handed strike-slip
faults.
</P>
<P>
   The Izmit earthquake may actually have increased the stresses on
the Istanbul segment of the fault, increasing the odds of a major
quake there in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much concerned about what might happen in that
area,'' Toksoz said. ``There is the potential for a major
earthquake.'' There is an earthquake building code in place in the
city, he said, ``but unfortunately, implementation is lax.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, a major quake striking the city ``could be
an economic disaster as well as a human disaster.'' Even this
week's quake, though centered 65 miles away, did some property
damage and caused a few deaths in Istanbul. ``But with warning, we
could at least prevent some of the human casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   This quake's magnitude, still being worked out by scientists in
Turkey, the United States and other countries, has been identified
as magnitude 7.5 by the MIT scientists, 6.8 by Turkish scientists,
and 7.8 by the US Geological Survey. Bill Smith, a geophysicist at
the US Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center
in Colorado, explained that such numbers are ``still subject to
change. Some of these magnitude calculations are very labor
intensive. . . . Magnitude is not a precise measurement, it's
really an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said scientists use six to eight different magnitude
numbers, computed using the various waves produced by a quake. But,
he said, ``In most cases, the numbers agree better than on this
one.'' It is not yet clear what this unusual disparity might mean,
he said. Toksoz added that readings based on measurements farther
from the site usually give a more accurate representation, because
instruments close to the quake can be ``saturated'' by the
intensity of the shaking and get a lower reading.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded since the main quake,
which occurred at about 3 a.m. local time. The largest of the
aftershocks was magnitude 5.3, just over three hours later, but
activity is continuing and will be closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was the largest recorded in Turkey since 1976.
