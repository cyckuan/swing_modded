<HEADLINE> Turkey Yet to Settle Tens of Thousands Quake Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 26,000 survivors of the
August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western
industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents
one year after the quake.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Daily News reported on Thursday that an additional 150,
000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are extremely
hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
Some victims who survived the disaster complained about their
grievance, saying that "the state doesn't care about us."
</P>
<P>
It is a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude
earthquake destroyed jerry-built apartment buildings, crushing some
17,000 people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
The quake almost leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of
Istanbul, as well as other towns in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The government has done a lot to handle the post-quake cleanup,
and the number of people in tents has fallen from some 120,000
immediately after the quake to 26,000 at present. The government
expects that number to decline sharply in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
It also has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake,
which seismologists warn could take place at any time.
