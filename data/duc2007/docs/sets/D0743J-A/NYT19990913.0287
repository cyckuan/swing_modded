   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least seven people died Monday and
hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same
region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge
earthquake less than a month ago. The tremor, which came in
mid-afternoon, was felt in Turkey's three biggest cities _
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir _ which are separated by hundreds of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   An Istanbul observatory reported that the quake registered 5.8
on the Richter scale (last month's quake registered 7.4). It caused
dozens of buildings to collapse and sent thousands of people racing
from their homes. At least 239 were injured, many suffering broken
bones after jumping from their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aftershocks have created panic,'' said President
Suleyman Demirel. ``I am worried that people who were already
nervous are now panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish television stations showed ambulances racing through the
streets of Izmit and Adapazari, towns near the reported epicenter
of the tremor. Other scenes showed people running through the
streets of Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings were reported to have collapsed in all three cities,
which were devastated by the Aug. 17 quake. Hundreds of people
gathered in streets and in parks, unwilling to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish
children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the
affected areas closed until further notice. Some parents said they
would keep children at home indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit also sent a team of government officials to survey the
damage by helicopter. Many Turks had criticized him for not
responding quickly when the big quake struck last month.
</P>
<P>
   Traders at the Istanbul stock exchange also felt the tremor.
Stock prices quickly began to fall, and after the index had dropped
more than 2 percent, trading was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and international telephone service was disrupted in
much of the region, making an accurate assessment of damage
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those killed Monday were driving a car through Golcuk
when a building fell onto their vehicle. Three others were crushed
by debris near Izmit, and a woman died of a heart attack as she
rushed from her home in Adapazari.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of people to run and jump from buildings at the
first sign of a tremor reflected the new sense of vulnerability
that many Turks feel. There have been hundreds of aftershocks since
the Aug. 17 earthquake, and seismologists say some can be
classified as quakes in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists have warned that aftershocks and tremors may shake
Turkey for months and possibly years. Most say there is little
chance of another major disaster anytime soon, but many Turks,
especially those in the devastated areas, have seen the damage a
quake can do and are evidently unwilling to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aftershocks may continue, and I hope they will not be as
violent as the one today,'' Ecevit said. ``We will have to learn to
live with them.''
</P>

<P>
   Thousands of people remain homeless after surviving the Aug. 17
quake, which shook the country's industrial heartland and has
riveted the attention of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the country's largest business federation
describes that quake as ``the biggest one of the 20th century
affecting a large, populated industrialized area.'' It said the
economic cost may exceed $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased uncertainty will negatively affect all economic
activity in Turkey,'' the report said. ``The damage necessitates
the influx of vast sums of funds to restore normal life in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week a quake struck neighboring Greece, killing more than
100 people. These seismic movements have given Greeks and Turks a
sense of shared destiny that is having important political
implications as the countries' governments move closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Seismic movements in Turkey over recent weeks, and the
government's widely perceived failure to respond to them, continue
to shake the political landscape here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders of the state should come here and see what it's
like,'' one women in the zone that was shaken Monday told a
television interviewer. ``No one can live here any more.''
