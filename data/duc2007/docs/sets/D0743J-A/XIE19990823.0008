ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Blaze in a refinery in western
Turkey has been put out thanks to the strong efforts made by
foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Sunday.

<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ismail Alakoc, the
chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries
Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in
Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's devastating earthquake has
been put out with the help of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Kocaeli is the most seriously devastated province after the
monster quake hit the western Turkey.

<P>
However, he said the strong fire had destroyed seven storage
tanks and damaged two other ones in the refinery which held 30
storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.

He said the blaze in the refinery was brought under control on
Friday and only one storage tank was burning at that time, adding
that one chimney in the refinery had collapsed.

<P>
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands,
Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia participated in the fight against
the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of the 30
storage tanks.

<P>
Turkish experts are expected to make research about the
pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large
areas around the Izmit Refinery.
