<HEADLINE>  Cyprus Sentences Two Israelis </HEADLINE>

	LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) -- Two Israelis found with radio scanners,  
maps and sophisticated equipment near an army commando training 
camp were sentenced today to three years in prison -- half the 
maximum allowed under Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has strained relations with Israel, whose growing  
military cooperation with Turkey has become a source of serious 
concern to Cyprus, more than one-third of which is occupied by 
Turkish troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis, arrested Nov. 6 at a fishing village on the  
southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a 
prohibited military area. Today, they also received concurrent jail 
terms of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary pleaded guilty to the  
lesser charges after the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy 
and espionage in an apparent plea bargain deal. Conspiracy and 
espionage carried maximum 10-year jail penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have  
radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The village is near military installations, including an army  
commando training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported that the Israelis had made calls to a number  
in Tel Aviv that was believed to be Israel's Mossad spy agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year sentence was half the maximum allowed under  
Cypriot law. 
</P>
<P>
	George Aresti, head of the three-member judicial panel of the  
Larnaca Assize Court, said that although the spying charge had been 
withdrawn, the court could not ignore that the two approached the 
military area ``at a time when a very serious military operation 
was under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports at the time that the operation involved the  
delivery of tanks and other military equipment for the Cypriot 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has maintained troops in northern Cyprus since 1974, when  
it invaded in support of Turkish Cypriots after a failed coup by 
Greek Cypriots who sought union with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had claimed that the Israelis were here in  
connection with an Israeli anti-terrorist operation that was not 
aimed at Cyprus. But the court said no evidence was produced to 
back up the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	After reducing the charges last week, Attorney-General Alecos  
Markides told a news conference that Cyprus had not been pressured 
to drop the spying and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Markides acknowledged, however, that his Israeli counterpart,  
Elyakim Rubinstein, had come to see him twice about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Jan. 20.
