Israel mum on pair arrested in Cyprus as spy suspects
</HEADLINE>

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel was officially silent Sunday on the
subject of two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying,
but a government official said Israeli diplomats would likely visit
them in prison.
	   Israeli foreign ministry spokeman Effii Ben-Matityahu had no
comment on the arrests other than to note that officials from the
Israeli consulate were expected to go to the Nicosia prison where
the two were being held.
	   Cypriot police said the two would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.
	   In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts
that the two _ arrested Saturday in the community of Ziyi near the
southern coastal resort of Larnaca for allegedly spying on a nearby
army base _ were working for the Mossad secret service.
	   A Cypriot police source said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben
Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the
arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with
Turkey in any spy operation.
	   Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's
presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb
the missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go
ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the
Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's
behalf. Israeli military commentator Oded Granot wrote in Maariv
newspaper that the two might have been caught in a training
exercise that went wrong.
	   Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, said methods and devices
used by the two were not typical of the Mossad. He speculated that
the two might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
	   Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras,
wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio
scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
	   Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent
months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as
part of their 1996 defense pact. Israel has repeatedly insisted
that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other
countries in the region.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching
up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last
week.
	   During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional
listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.
