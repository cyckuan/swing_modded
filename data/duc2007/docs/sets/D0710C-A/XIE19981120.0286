<HEADLINE> Israel Admits Two Mossad Agents Arrested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents,
Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the admission during his meeting with Cypriot
Ambassador to Israel Euripedes Evriviades on Wednesday, CNA
quoted well-informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said that the two were not acting against
Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said he was sorry that his words to the press
last week were misunderstood in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, local media slammed Netanyahu's statement that he
would bring back the two Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, were arrested here
on November 7 after police raided their apartment and found
hi-tech equipment tuned into the police radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
They were allegedly operating in a sensitive military area at
a time of increased military activities in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Larnaca District Court issued a remand order to the two
suspects on November 7 for eight-day pending investigations. The
two Israelis will appear again before the court Friday morning
after they were remanded for another five days.
</P>
<P>
CNA Thursday also quoted Moshe Fogel, director of the Israeli
government press office, as saying that "the prime minister said
he would try to resolve the problem."
</P>
<P>
There is ongoing contacts between the two countries, said the
director, refusing to comment any further on the matter.
