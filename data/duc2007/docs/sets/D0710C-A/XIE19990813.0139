NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis
jailed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis, Igar Damary, 49 and Udi Hargov, 37, were
sentenced in February to three years in jail for approaching a
restricted area and possessing banned listening devices without
the permission of the Cyprus authorities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government said Thursday that President Clerides decided
to grant pardon to the two Israelis and suspend their prison terms
as their continuing imprisonment "no longer served the national
interest."
</P>
<P>
"President Weizman had a long and very warm and friendly
conversation with President Clerides on Thursday evening during
which he thanked the President of Cyprus for suspending the
sentence," the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, Barak also called Clerides to thank him
personally for his move.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has accepted an invitation from his Israeli
counterpart to pay an official visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman paid an official visit to Cyprus last November.
