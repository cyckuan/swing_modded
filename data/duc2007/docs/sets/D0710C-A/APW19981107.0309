	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek Cypriot police arrested two Israeli
men Saturday on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them
detained pending investigation.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
two men were suspected of spying for Israel on behalf of Turkey.
The two countries have a military alliance.
	   Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was also quoted by Cyprus state
radio as saying that it should not be assumed they were spying for
Israel.
	   This was seen as an inference that spying, if any, might be for
Turkey, which has occupied the northern third of the island of
Cyprus since a 1974 invasion in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   In the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was a listening post for the
intelligence agents of Israel as well as the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which was based in Lebanon, a half-hour flight from
the Mediterranean island.
	   The suspects appeared in Larnaca District Court hours after
police raided and searched their apartment in the village of Ziyi
shortly after midnight. Ziyi is near an army camp and the southern
coastal town of Larnaca.
	   Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the district, told
the court that an investigation is being conducted of whether the
two spied on the Cypriot army.
	   Kyriacou said the pair arrived in Cyprus on Friday. They also
visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22, when
the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby. The two men
were under surveillance, he said.
	   The men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary, 49.
They will appear in court again on Nov. 16 when formal charges
could be filed or the prosecution might ask for further remand.
	   The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman
ended a three-day visit to the island. The visit, the first by an
Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the
lukewarm relations between the two countries.
