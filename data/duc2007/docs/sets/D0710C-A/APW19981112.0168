Report: Israel says suspects in Cyprus were Mossad agents
</HEADLINE>

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last
week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence
agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
	   Israel's government has not acknowledged that the two are
Israeli agents. Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry
would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of
Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. Turkey has occupied
the northern third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974.
	   The statement also said the two men were not acting against
Cyprus.
	   Cypriot police arrested the Israelis in the coastal fishing town
of Ziyi on Saturday and accused them of spying on a nearby army
base.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that the two men were part of an
Israeli intelligence operation held near Ziyi last Friday and
Saturday. The newspaper said it learned from a senior source in
Cyprus that the two men had been guarding a meeting of Mossad
agents. They were listening to police scanners to make sure no one
approached the meeting place, the newspaper said.
	   The Mossad told the authorities in Cyprus that it was not
interested in damaging Nicosia's sovereignty and that it was simply
going about its business.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three
days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to
ease tensions over the case.
	   The source in Cyprus said comments by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that ``of course we'll bring
them home'' had damaged chances the two would be quickly released.
