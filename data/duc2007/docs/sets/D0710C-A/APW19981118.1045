Netanyahu tells Cyprus Israel did not act against it

	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office Wednesday regarding two Israelis accused of
spying in Cyprus was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation
the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
	   Netanyahu's office said the premier met with the Cypriot
ambassador to Israel after reviewing an internal investigation
regarding the spy charges.
	   Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men
in custody in Nicosia, Cyprus are Mossad agents.
	   ``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could
confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on
Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey.'' There was
no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked
independently of the government.
	   The two Israelis, who enter Cyprus on false passports, were
arrested Nov. 6 in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi. Police
found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment
the two men had rented.
	   Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said that shortly before their
arrest, the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence
institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.'' Police officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men were believed
to be spying on behalf of Turkey, which has close relations with
Israel but not with Cyprus.
	   Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the
island, are interested in gaining information on the planned
deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Cypriot officials have said that if the two men turn out to be
Mossad agents, it would deeply affect relations between the two
countries.
	   In September 1997, Israeli Mossad agents were caught in Jordan
trying to assassinate a political figure in the militant Hamas
group. The incident strained Israeli-Jordanian relations.
