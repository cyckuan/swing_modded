	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Israel on Monday tried to repair any
damage done to relations with Cyprus after the weekend arrest of
two Israelis on suspicion of spying for the Greek Cypriot
government's enemy, Turkey.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus three days
before the Israelis' arrest Saturday, sent his Cypriot counterpart
a ``message of friendship,'' Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told
reporters.
	   ``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend
will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said
	   The Justice Ministry said Sunday evening that the men have not
been linked to Israel's government, but an investigation continues.
	   Police officials have said privately that the Israelis probably
were gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000
troops in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   Israel has not denied the men worked for its Mossad intelligence
agency. Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``Every Israeli citizen is important to
us. We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home.''
	   The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing
village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and
Limassol. They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight
days for a police investigation.
	   A police statement said that the two were suspected of spying on
the Cypriot National Guard and that cameras, recordings of police
radio messages, radio scanners and maps were found in the
apartment.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974,
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
