<HEADLINE> Release of Jailed Israelis Not Considered: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Tuesday indicated that he is not considering release
of two Israeli agents jailed on Monday for three years.
</P>
<P>
The president also told reporters that there is no agreement
between the two countries so that Igal Damary, 49, and Udi
Hargov, 37, can serve their sentence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were arrested in early November last year at
the small fishing village of Zigi on the Cypriot southern coast
and were found carrying radio scanners, a lat-top computer, cell
phones and eight maps of the island.
</P>
<P>
They had pleaded guilty to charges of approaching a restricted
military zone and possessing banned listening equipment.
</P>
<P>
Spying charges pressed against the two Israelis were dropped by
the prosecution for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that pardon cannot be granted unless some of the
sentence is served, the Prisons Director submits a good report on
their conduct and the Attorney General agrees that reasons for
pardon exist.
</P>
<P>
Clerides dismissed press reports that the spying charges were
dropped because of pressure.
