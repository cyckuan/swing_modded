Report: Mossad operations chief resigns over Cyprus affair
</HEADLINE>

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior official in Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of
two agents in Cyprus _ the third botched spy mission in a year.
	   The Mossad operations chief, known publicly only as ``Y,''
offered to step down after Cypriot police arrested the two Israelis
and seized electronic monitoring equipment, the daily Haaretz
newspaper reported Tuesday. Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy accepted
``Y's'' resignation, the paper said.
	   An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the
report.
	   The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is
responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment.
	   The suspects were caught with tapes of police conversations and
surveillance devices near an army base on the Mediterranean island
earlier this month.
	   Cyprus has accused them of operating with ``a specific
intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.'' Police
on the island said the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, which
has a defense pact with Israel.
	   The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the
two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf
of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
	   ``Y'' also had offered his resignation earlier this year after
Swiss police arrested five Mossad agents for allegedly spying in a
residential area of Bern, Israel radio said.
	   Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned in February following a
failed attempt to assassinate a leader of the radical Islamic group
Hamas in Jordan. Haaretz said ``Y'' was not involved in that
operation.
