<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will start a four-day state visit to Israel next Tuesday, local
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The coming visit, the first ever to Israel by a Cyprus head of
state, is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip
to Cyprus in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Clerides will hold talks with Weizman, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believed that the visit is a bridge-
building act aimed to cement the Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by an
espionage scandal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48
hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit
to the island country in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They were caught spying on a secret military shipment near
Larnaca, Cyprus' southern coast and were sentenced to three years
in prison for trespassing on a prohibited military area in February
last year. The two were released six months later.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will also visit the West Bank city of Ramallah for
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
