 &HT;    Atlanta mass killer had troubled life
 &HT;    By Jay Croft, Alan Judd
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death
was unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in
the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but
listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his
first wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing
spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother
said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old
chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I
loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in
a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C. ``I wish
there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way
that it could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated
Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children,
Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta
office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
</P>
<P>
   But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage
disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days
between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as
``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his
children were suffering and hurting as well.''
</P>
<P>
   From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man
whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried
to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he
wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the
living room of his Henry County apartment. ``I have come to have no
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather
unremarkable childhood.
</P>
<P>
   An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton
moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11. After
graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson
University but dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina
in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry
and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and
Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
They were married May 5, 1979. Soon they were living in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep
Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue,
vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company,
National Service Industries.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives
followed a rocky path.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a
Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds. By 1988, he
had been named TLC's president. He made as much as $86,000 a year
and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, he was fired. In a deposition, Barton said
TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to
Atlanta to start his own business.
</P>
<P>
   But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired
from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept. 25, 1990, and briefly jailed on
charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled
with information from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board
members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff
Heminger said.
</P>
<P>
   After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a
chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc., in July
1990. But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he
testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand
dollars of business a year. In January 1992, after resigning from a
raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a
sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling
raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint
industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company,
now known as Lintech International.
</P>
<P>
   With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales
from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee:
20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone
operator. She married David Lang a month after starting work, in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to
get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he
was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding
that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
</P>
<P>
   They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August
when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to
leave her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the
Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany
him to Panama City. The trip was to take place the weekend after
Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two
days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise
Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside
Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama. They had been hacked to death
with a sharp, heavy blade.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Edgar Smith, an investigator with the district attorney's
office that covers Cedar Grove, Ala., where Debra and her mother
were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer,
since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses
said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of
the murders. He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through
a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly
spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and
home. Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an
interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who
confessed to the killing. This person is now serving an unrelated
prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his
statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had
spent the night of the murders with friends.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra
alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red
Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by
himself, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he
sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed. He
played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter
album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa,
awoke during the night and headed to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ADDITONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had
taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000
for her.
</P>
<P>
   Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and
that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full
taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified. ``And she wanted
the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a
smaller amount.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked
to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co. of Nebraska and
Primerica Life Co., took Barton to court. Lawyers for Investors
Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that he was involved in those deaths,'' Ben
Kingree III, an Atlanta lawyer who represented Investors Life, said
Friday. ``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life
insurance policy. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in
September 1997. The company paid out $450,000 as part of a
settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's
children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost
$66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years
before from Primerica, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only
Barton could have been guilty. But the case never went to a grand
jury for indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday,
to warn her that she might be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his needs, then
he'd kill her, too,'' he said. ``The lifestyle that he had
indicated that he needed (required) a young, sexy wife to maintain
the status quo. That's what he felt like he needed. I told her, I
said, `When you cease to fill those needs, you know he's going to
kill you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ADDITONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Barton and Lang both resigned from Lomas in October 1994. The
following May 26, they were married in Clayton County.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Barton had taken a sales job with Alchem
Chemical Co. in Atlanta. Not long after he joined the company, said
general manager Chuck Matthews, co-workers began hearing rumors
about Barton's suspected role in his wife's death. ``This has
always been on the back of everybody's minds,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, Barton left Alchem and went to work for Micro-Blend
Chemical Co. In March, the company filed court papers in Clayton
County Superior Court over a debt by Barton, records show.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1999, Barton ventured out of the chemical industry for
the first time in his career, joining the volatile world of day
trading in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   He opened an account at the Atlanta office of Momentum
Securities Inc. on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he claimed a net worth of $750,000, with $250,000
in liquid assets. His income from Micro-Blend, he said, was $85,000
a year. His wife, he added, made $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   He told company executives that he had seen their advertisement
on the CNBC cable business-news network.
</P>
<P>
   At Momentum, Barton enjoyed little of the success that other
investors have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Between June 9 and last Tuesday, he lost $105,000, according to
a letter that Momentum sent Friday to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. On Thursday, with his children and wife laying dead in
their apartment, Barton sat at the computer he had used to track
stock prices and wrote a chilling confession that concluded, ``You
should kill me if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he met with his lawyer, Joseph H. Fowler of Douglasville,
to attend to what Fowler on Friday described as ``routine will and
estate issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With stock prices falling, Barton drove his green minivan to the
Buckhead secdtion of Atlanta. He walked into Momentum's third-floor
trading room and exchanged routine greetings with other traders and
company employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made comments to the extent it was a bad trading day,''
said Harvard, the Atlanta police chief, ``and something to the
effect that it was going to get worse.''
