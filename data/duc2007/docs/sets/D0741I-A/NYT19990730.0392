   ATLANTA _ Before he killed his wife with a hammer...Before he
murdered his sleeping children...Before he went on a shooting spree
that killed nine people and injured 12... Mark Barton put on a
Scout uniform to take his son to a troop meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tuesday afternoon at the Bristol Green apartments in
Stockbridge, and Travis Holmes, 14, saw Barton and his son and
struck up a conversation with them. Travis is a Scout, so everyone
had something in common. They talked about merit badges. They
talked about camp.
</P>
<P>
   Travis saw no signs that Barton was about to take the first
steps on a terrifying journey that would devestate families,
challenge a city's sense of security and rivet the nation with its
intimate brutality and horrific randomness.
</P>
<P>
   But another person who saw him Tuesday noticed that something
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   `Something's weird'
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese
remembers thinking when Barton, a troop leader, came to pick up her
grandsonwho was friends with Barton's son.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta
suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh
Ann. Mrs. Barton had moved Matthew and his 7-year-old sister
Elizabeth Mychelle to a Stockbridge apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Mrs. DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with
the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange. She chalked
it up to their closeness.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way for Travis to know on Tuesday afternoon that he
was chatting with a man who, by his own admission, was consumed
with hatred. Or that Mark Barton would cause so much anguish and
grief in the next three days, Barton's last three days on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the ordinary conversation about Scouts, however,
Barton killed his wife with a hammer and stuffed her body in a
bedroom closet. The next morning and afternoon, Barton stayed in
the apartment with his 11-year-old Matthew, and his daughter,
8-year-old Mychelle, said Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County
Police Department. On Wednesday night, Barton smashed the hammer
into his children and then held them down in a bathtub to make sure
they were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he tidied up, put the kids back in bed and
tucked them in. They said he left a video game on Matthew's body
and a stuffed toy on Mychelle's body. Now he was alone in an
apartment with three bodies. He booted up a home computer and
started typing a note for the police. He addressed it ``To Whom It
May Concern'' and dated it Thursday, July 29, at 6:38 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer,'' he said, ``just long
enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading day got worse
</P>
<P>
   About eight hours later, just before 2:30 p.m. Thursday, Barton
strolled into the offices of Momentum Securities Inc., a
day-trading firm on the third floor of a Buckhead office building.
It's a place where people sit in front of computers to gamble on
the stock market, hoping for instant gains.
</P>
<P>
   He had traded many times before in this office and was known to
the people who worked there.
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged pleasantries. Barton told them he wanted to make
a few transactions.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted for a minute or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   Police later said he made a chilling remark:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad trading day and it's about to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Barton whipped out two pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``He then shot both guns at the same time, `` Atlanta Police
Chief Beverly Harvard said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt begins
</P>
<P>
   Police got the first call about the gunfire at Momentum's third
floor office at 2:56 p.m. A woman told 911 dispatchers that a man
had come into the office and shot people. Two minutes later, at
2:58 p.m., a man sounding more urgent told police four people were
dead at Momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The first Atlanta police officer arrived at the office at 3
p.m., Harvard said. Blood was everywhere. A thick trail snaked
around the third floor hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was immediately told that four people were dead and he went
up to Suite 310,'' Harvard said. ``He called for back-up and other
officers arrived within seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officers began canvassing the office, stepping carefully
over the victims, they heard voices coming from a smaller room just
a few feet from where the slain victims lay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers found several people huddled in the smaller room,
they had gone in there to hide,'' Harvard said. ``One of the people
had thrown a computer out the window to attract the attrention of
someone on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the women in the room shouted out, 'Mark Barton shot
us!' ``
</P>
<P>
   While the cops began combing through the other offices on the
third floor, another officer circled his motorcycle on Piedmont
Road below. Suddeny shots rang out at a complex of other office
building across the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies are everywhere
</P>
<P>
   Other officers arrived and were told the shots were coming from
Suite 215 in building eight of the Piedmont Center, an office
complex made up of 11 buildings. A security guard from Barton
Protective Services, Inc., _ the company is not related to Barton _
told officers they heard several shots.
</P>
<P>
   The officers went inside and saw five people slumped over their
computer terminals. Several others were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Barton is missing
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:15 p.m. Barton was nowhere in sight and the officers
began their thorough search for the shooter throughout Piedmont
Center. Ambulances flooded Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   Even the seasoned paramedics who patrol Atlanta's toughest
neighborhoods said they'd never seen anything like the carnage at
two Buckhead offices where nine were slain Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers had alerted medical personnel to expect several
victims, both dead and wounded. But paramedics said what they found
was far worse than what they had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see shootings all the time, they almost seen routine,''
said Reginald McCoy, a paramedic with Grady Memorial Hospital.
``But I've never seen anything like that ... the volume. It was
utter chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta, Miles South, the
manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex in Stockbridge was
thinking about the quiet apartment unit in building 1300. The rent
was late, and he wondered what was up.
</P>
<P>
   He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes
after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in.
</P>
<P>
   Notes on the bodies
</P>
<P>
   After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Both Matthew and Elizabeth Mychelle were dead, apparently from
blows to the head. They lay in their beds, all but their faces
covered. A handwritten note rested by each child's body.
</P>
<P>
   Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and
similarly covered, with another scribbled note. In the living room
was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer
Barton so loved.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, meanwhile, was across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Escape in the woods?
</P>
<P>
   At about 3:30 p.m., Lori Woodward and a handful of employees at
the Ivy Place Buildingspotted a man wearing a red shirt and khaki
pants, running south on Piedmont Road toward the Lenox Road
intersection. Woodard and her colleagues had learned from radio and
TV news that police were looking for a shooter wearing those
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea he had just shot the people at Piedmont
center,'' Woodard said. ``We watched him because he looked strange,
He was carrying, like, a knapsack on his back and he was acting
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said the man ran along the Buckhead Loop in the
direction of Phipps Plaza on Lenox Road. He stopped short however
when he spotted an Atlanta police cruiser rolling his way, Woodard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point he looked around and then walked up the driveway
of a building that's under construction at the corner of Piedmont
and Lenox,'' Woodard said. ``He kept looking around and looking
over his shoulder. He noticed two more officers at the top of the
driveway, he turned around walked back to the street and then ran
into a patch of woods. We never saw him after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers swarm the buildings
</P>
<P>
   For hours, officers with shotguns searched the parking decks at
Piedmont Center and several office buildings. Employees remained
locked in their offices because officers did not know whether the
killer was still around. Police dogs sniffed the bushes. And FBI
agents dressed for war searched the area along Piemont Road.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours passed before authorities heard from someone who had
seen Barton. Security officers at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw,
about 20 miles from Buckhead, saw Barton's unoccupied van in the
mall lot about 7:40 p.m. About the same time, a woman who'd been
shopping at Rich's approached her parked car. Barton walked toward
her. He had a black bag that hung over the shoulder of his neatly
pressed blue short-sleeve shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't scream or I'll shoot you,'' he said, according to a
police report.
</P>
<P>
   The woman backed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't run or I'll shoot you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She ran. He did not shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Looming large in a minivan
</P>
<P>
   Mannon Smith, who was also at the mall, said she saw Barton in
the parking lot and recognized him as the suspect in the deadliest
mass murder in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this totally, totally freakish thing,'' Smith said. ``I
was absolutely positive it was him. I was shocked. You pull up
behind a car and here was this guy everone is looking for. Nobody
expected him in Kennesaw. ''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot, 4-inches tall, Barton loomed large in the mini-van,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911. Operaters at first
were skeptical, but eventually believed Smith when she described
the van and read off the license plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him looking back and seeing me on the phone
reporting him,'' Smith said. ``I really wanted to get off the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she briefly followed Barton until he turned onto
Barrett Parkway. He turned right toward I-75. She turned left.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she thought briefly about tailing Barton but quickly
decided to leave that up to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just killed 12 people,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mall officials had alerted police. Officers all over
the northern part of Cobb County were looking for the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Police Officer Huel Clements was on I-75 when he saw
a minivan matching the description of Barton's minivan. He relayed
the tag number by radio to a dispatcher. The dispatcher confirmed
his suspicion: it was Barton's minivan. He followed Barton, keeping
a safe distance at first so as not to tip off Barton that he was
being followed. He also told fellow officers by radio what he had
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   On the run
</P>
<P>
   About 7:50 p.m., as the day continued its slow summer surrender
to evening, Barton turned off the interstate onto Ga. 92 in
Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main cocern was keeping survelliance and waiting for
backup,'' Clements said Friday, still wearing the black stripe
across his badge to honor the two Cobb officers who were killed in
the line of duty last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Barton passed a service station on his left and turned right
just past a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. Then he turned left
and eased into a BP gasoline station. Officer Clements, still
behind Barton, turned on his blue lights. Then his siren sounded
for a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   Dane Pritchett, 14, saw what happened next. She was in the
backseat of a car in the McDonald's parking lot, waiting for her
brother and his girlfriend to bring her a fish filet sandwich and
French Fries. She said Barton slowed at the gas pumps, as if he was
going to stop, but then pulled up about 35 feet to a spot between
the pumps and the BP Car Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly an Acworth police cruiser whipped into the gas station
parking lot and stopped in front of the minivan. Officer Clements,
behind Barton's minivan, leapt out of his car, drew his gun and
crouched behind the door of his patrol car. Pritchett said he
trained his gun on the minivan and shouted at its driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling `Get out! Get out!''' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, Cpl. Curtis Endicott of the Acworth Police
Department had whipped his patrol car into the BP parking lot to
block a possible escape route for Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot's going through your mind when you have suspect of this
magnitude. I was scared,'' Endicott said. ``I didn't know what he
might do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Endicott threw open his door of his police car, Barton raised
a 9mm pistol to one side of his head and a .45 caliber pistol to
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a muffled sound,'' Pritchett said, ``and his head
fell against the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 7:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the six Acworth police officers on duty had arrived
by this time. They bounded out of their patrol cars and pointed
their guns at the van. One of the officers walked tensely towards
the driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked over and with one hand slung the door open and then
backed off,'' Pritchett said. ``I guess he saw blood or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fowler, the clerk at the Amoco service station across the
street, said he could tell the danger had passed by watching the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all just started holstering their guns,'' he said. ``I
guess they knew he was dead.
