   ATLANTA _ While relatives of Mark O. Barton's victims continued
making funeral and memorial arrangements Saturday and wondered why
tragedy had struck so close to home, family members of the victim
closest to Barton _ his wife, Leigh Ann _ struggled with questions
and doubts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Barton's grandmother, Pauline Vandiver, 78, sat with
family in the antique-packed living room of her home in Macon, Ga.,
remembering the soft-spoken woman who was killed by a man they
never quite trusted.
</P>
<P>
   As family and friends delivered foil-wrapped banana bread and a
fruit basket tied with a yellow ribbon, the Vandivers struggled
with whether they should have foreseen the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Lewis, Leigh Ann Barton's cousin, said the whole family
was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his
first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey.
Several family members, including Lewis, thought he must have done
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ride in the car with him all the way back to Macon,''
Lewis said, recalling her trip from the Atlanta wedding to Macon
for a reception while Mark Barton's children rode with Leigh Ann.
``I was so scared, you know, if he killed his wife. He didn't talk
the whole time. Not one word.''
</P>
<P>
   According to family members, Joe Vandiver told his daughter
outright that he believed Mark Barton was guilty of the crimes.
Leigh Ann insisted he wasn't, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they laughed as they told stories about Leigh Ann
sucking her thumb as a little girl, and they fought back tears as
Vandiver remembered a gift basket of lavender goodies Leigh Ann
brought for what turned out to be her last visit home _ Mother's
Day. They described her as lady-like with a Christian school
background. And she never forgot a family event.
</P>
<P>
   But they also remembered a woman torn between a husband she
wanted to leave and the children she wanted to stay with. Leigh Ann
didn't want to have children, but she came to love Mark Barton's
son and daughter like they were her own, her grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids thought more of her than they did him,''
great-uncle Larry Vandiver said of Leigh Ann, 27, and Mark Barton,
44. ``They called her Momma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If I ever leave Mark I'm going to take these
kids,''' Pauline Vandiver recalled her granddaughter saying during
the Mothers' Day trip.
</P>
<P>
   In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann
on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge
apartment. Barton said he killed his two children, Matthew, 11, and
Mychelle, 8, the next evening. One day later, he went on a shooting
spree through two Buckhead office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Barton's family learned with television viewers that
she and the children were dead. They will bury her at 1 p.m. today
in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality's setting in since they got the body home,'' said
Vandiver.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with metro Atlantans trying to cope with the latest
blast of violence, the sad parade of funerals and memorials
continued. Pastors and rabbis were trying to draw some sense from
these tragic events. And many people were gathering for comfort,
healing and reflection on one man's bizarre behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the friends and family of Dean Delawalla, 52,
gathered for his funeral services at the National Cremation Society
Memorial Center in Lilburn. The former attorney and businessman, a
devout Muslim, had been preparing for his daughter Shahala's
birthday when he was killed in the storm of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is set for today for Allen Charles Tenenbaum,
a 48-year-old father of three. More than 1,000 people attended his
funeral Friday. The memorial service will be at noon today at
Congregation Or VeShalom, where Tenenbaum served as president. His
chair at the pulpit will be covered for at least a month in his
memory, said Jack Arogeti, vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness was his nature,'' Arogeti said.
</P>
<P>
   The immense outpouring of sympathy for the nine people shot to
death prompted the scheduling of a memorial service Saturday at the
Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead. Afterward, a walk was planned down
Piedmont Road to the two office buildings _ Securities Centre and
the Piedmont Center _ where the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements for Barton himself have been kept secret by
the family.
</P>
<P>
   At the Henry County apartment where Barton killed his wife and
two children, mourners placed a half-dozen small flower bouquets at
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest in Peace, Leigh Ann, Matthew and Michelle,'' read a note
left in a hanging basket outside. ``May God be with You,'' was the
inscription on a torn peace of paper in a potted plant.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the only activity inside the apartment was
cleanup by a crime scene crew. Three employees of Metro Crime Scene
Disposal spent three hours removing pillows and blankets. They also
cut out sections of mattresses and carpet for transportation to
medical incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very little bloodshed'' at the apartment, said
company representative Gordy Powell. He said the scene was
consistent with Barton's note describing how he beat the children
unconscious, then drowned them.
</P>
<P>
   He described the apartment as a neat, ``middle-income family
setting'' that reflected a woman's taste in ``country decor.''
Among the possessions left behind, to be claimed by family members,
were some Happy Meals toys.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said things are returning to normal at the apartment
complex, as the numbers of sightseers and camera crews dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   At a gas station a mile from the Stockbridge apartment, a clerk
who recognized Barton from news photos said he would frequently buy
$1 or $2 worth of gas and complain in a serious tone that the
station's prices were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Some metro Atlanta religious leaders said they would discuss the
slayings in services today. The Rev. Randy Stamper, considering
what he may tell his assembly at Faith Free Full Gospel Church in
Buford, commented on Barton: ``Some people seem to lose all hope,
and they don't have any major foundation in life but money. When he
lost that, he lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta's grief reached to Littleton, Colo., where
four months earlier 13 people were killed at Columbine High School.
The two gun-crazed students, like Barton, also committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one sickening tragedy after another,'' said Rick
Castaldo, who moved with his second wife across the country to be
with his 17-year-old son, Richard, left paralyzed from the
Columbine attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even some people in the Denver area whose families were not
directly affected by the Columbine shootings said a familiar wave
of disbelief washed over them Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening all over again in Atlanta and we still have no
answers in Littleton,'' said Katryn Stienmark, who works for St.
Frances Cabrini Catholic Church, the Littleton church where many
families and students sought solace and several of the slain were
eulogized. ``We're thinking, `My God!'''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, 10 people injured in the shootings remain
hospitalized, some in critical condition in intensive care units.
One wounded victim was released from the hospital Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Schimming, a branch manager for All-Tech, said the four
All-Tech employees still in the hospital are ``progressing. They're
still not out of the woods, but they're doing better.''
