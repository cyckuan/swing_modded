<HEADLINE> Police Across Street During Spree </HEADLINE>

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Nothing in the second building where Mark Barton  
opened fire was going to stop him from killing. Not the unmonitored 
video cameras, not the unarmed security guard, and especially not 
the police across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides trying to understand why Barton killed his family and  
then nine people at two Atlanta brokerages, authorities spent 
Friday assessing how Barton traversed one of the city's busiest 
thoroughfares unimpeded to continue his rampage. He then fled, 
spurring a five-hour manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how he got away,'' said Atlanta Police Chief  
Beverly Harvard. ``We did everything exactly as it should have been 
done, and the officers did an excellent job, especially when it 
came to response time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first stop was Securities Centre, which houses Momentum  
Securities, a day-trading firm where the 44-year-old had traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barton was a regular client, and one of those people who  
would have never been stopped,'' said Magnes Welsh, spokeswoman for 
Jones Lang Lasalle, the Chicago firm that manages Security Centre. 
``There was nothing unusual about his arrival at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-story building features unarmed guards at the  
entrance, while customers and employees come and go at will during 
regular office hours. The same is true at Barton's second stop, 
Perimeter Center, another seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harvard said Barton loitered at Securities Centre for about  
30 minutes before drawing his guns. She said witnesses recalled him 
saying ``It's a bad trading day, and it's going to get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four died after Barton opened fire. He then crossed Piedmont  
Avenue, one of Atlanta's main north-south arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum Securities is on the third floor, but other workers in  
the building weren't surprised he was able to get out so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are four elevators and they come pretty quick,'' said  
Beth Lavender, a client service specialist for Financial 
Development Corp., a floor below the shooting. ``And there are two 
doors in and out, so he probably was able to get out fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Piedmont Center, Barton opened fire again, killing five more  
at All-Tech Investment Group -- another day-trading firm where 
Barton had been a client. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities responded to the first call within four minutes, but  
then a backup officer heard shots across the street. By the time he 
arrived, Barton was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	But police, thinking he was still inside, began a painstaking  
search of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to remember that it was the end of the business  
day,'' Ms. Harvard said. ``And we are talking about Piedmont 
Avenue, one of the busiest streets of the city. There were a lot of 
people coming and going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how Barton carried his two handguns, a 9 mm Glock  
and a Colt .45, as he walked around Buckhead -- an upscale district 
north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other guns -- a .25 caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a  
.22 caliber Harrington &AMP; Richardson revolver -- later were found 
along with a duffel bag filled with 200 rounds of .45 ammunition 
and two pairs of handcuffs in Barton's minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton purchased the Glock at a store in Warner Robins in 1993  
and the H&AMP;R revolver at a pawn shop in South Carolina in 1976, said 
a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The .45, with which Barton later committed suicide, was  
purchased by a gun dealer in Texas in 1983, but it was unclear how 
Barton got it. And the Raven was bought at an unspecified Georgia 
pawn shop in 1992, but not by Barton. The identity of the previous 
owner was not disclosed.
