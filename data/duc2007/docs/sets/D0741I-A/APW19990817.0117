<HEADLINE> Victim's Wife Sues Day Trading Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The widow of a man murdered by Mark O. Barton  
during his shooting spree last month at two day-trading firms has 
filed the first lawsuit stemming from the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulshan Harjee, wife of victim Dean Delawalla, sued the All-Tech  
Investment Group, Barton's estate, the owners of the building where 
All-Tech's Atlanta office is located and the building's security 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Delawalla, 52, an All-Tech customer, was trading at the office  
when Barton opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other allegations, the suit filed Friday claims All-Tech  
negligently failed to supervise Barton and to protect him from 
large financial losses that may have prompted the shootings. The 
``murderous acts ... were reasonably foreseeable'' by company 
officials, it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, a former chemist who reportedly lost as much as $450,000  
while trading at All-Tech and Momentum Securities in the last year, 
killed nine people and wounded 13 others at the two companies' 
Atlanta offices on July 29. Hours later, he committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the attacks, Barton also killed his wife and two  
children, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weinstock, Ms. Harjee's attorney, said All-Tech had a  
responsibility to check the backgrounds of its day traders and 
should have discovered that Barton was a ``volatile individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creating a pressure environment that, in this case,  
with the pressure environment on top of a volatile individual ... 
it basically exacerbates a dangerous circumstance,'' Weinstock said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Lerner, an attorney for Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, did  
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also said Barton Protective Services, which is not  
related to Mark Barton, failed to provide adequate security in 
All-Tech's office building. It also seeks compensation from 
Barton's estate and the building's owner.
