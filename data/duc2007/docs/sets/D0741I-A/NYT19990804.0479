   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 5: &QL;

   The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in
which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil. But it is a
reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat
stock trading as something like casino gambling. It must be closely
regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the
risks.
</P>

   Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia
on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum
Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.

   Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick
purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no
stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage
of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in
changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a
stock. Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago,
but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves
in volatile stocks.

   Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do
little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach
people how to be successful day traders. Barton took one such
class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web
site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know
anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day
trader. Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try
day trading lose money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need
to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not
make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules
that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading. But the
regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money
away.
