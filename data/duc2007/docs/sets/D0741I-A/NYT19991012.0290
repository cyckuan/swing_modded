 &HT;    Mother of Atlanta office shooting victim sues

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A third lawsuit resulting from Mark O. Barton's July
29 killing spree at two day trading firms has been filed in Fulton
County State Court.
</P>
<P>
   Alyce F. Wenzel, the mother of 30-year-old shooting victim Scott
Allyn Webb, claims in her lawsuit that Momentum Securities, Jones
Lang LaSalle Americas and Barton Protective Services failed to
prevent the killing of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum should have known Barton was engaging in high-stakes
trading and suffering major losses, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum . . . knew or should have known through exercise of
due care, that the business of day trading is a high risk,
stressful and volatile enterprise,'' according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the three companies ``should have known of the
potentially dangerous conditions contained on the premises and
failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitees
within the office complex from the reasonably foreseeable criminal
acts of a third person.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities is the company where Webb and three other
people were shot and killed July 29 by Barton. Five other people
were shot to death across the street at a second day trading firm.
Jones Lang LaSalle Americas is the owner and manager of the
building at 3500 Piedmont Road where the killings took place, and
Barton Protective Services is the company responsible for the
building's security.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's estate is also named as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities released a brief statement expressing
sympathy for the victims of the shooting rampage, but said it is
not responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that Mark Barton, not Momentum
Securities, is the one who was and is responsible for these tragic
and unforeseeable events,'' the statement read in part.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants either declined comment or could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages,
court costs and attorney's fees.
</P>
<P>
   In August, two weeks after the shooting, the family of Dean
Delawalla, who was shot to death, filed a similar lawsuit. On Sept.
27, the family of Yuzef Liberzon, who is recovering from gunshot
wounds at Atlanta's Shepherd Center, did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fourth lawsuit is likely on the way, said Jan P.
Cohen, an attorney for the victims' relatives. Cohen declined to
identify who would be filing the fourth lawsuit.
