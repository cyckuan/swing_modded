<HEADLINE> Note Surfaces From Atlanta Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The investor who killed his family and nine  
people at two brokerage firms vowed in a note to kill ``the people 
that greedily sought my destruction,'' police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton left the computer-generated note in the living  
room of his family's apartment in suburban Stockbridge, describing 
how he killed his wife and two children by hitting them in the head 
with a hammer Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jimmy Mercer, police 
chief in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located. 
</P>
<P>
	The note made no direct reference to Thursday's slayings at the  
two brokerage firms in Atlanta, except the reference to greedy 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to  
kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton wrote that he killed his children -- 11-year-old Matthew  
and 8-year-old Mychelle -- to spare them the pain of living without 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a hammer ``just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a  
relatively painless way to die,'' he wrote. ``There was little 
pain. All of them were dead in less than five minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton also expressed regret for killing his 27-year-old wife,  
Leigh Ann, ``my honey, my precious love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't 
killed her now. She really couldn't help it and I love her so much 
anyway,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, 44, killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in  
on him in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours after the 
shootings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen people were injured at the two brokerage firms, some by  
bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer. 
Four remained in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, Barton was a suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of  
his first wife and her mother, authorities said. But Mercer said 
Barton's note denied responsibility for those slayings and wrote, 
``There's no reason for me to lie now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day  
trader, an investor who attempts to profit from moment-by-moment 
changes in the stock market, a risky trading method. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting rampage -- the third in the Atlanta area in little  
more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 
3.1 million and quickly captured national attention. It was the 
latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, 
and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when  
he walked into the Momentum Securities day trading firm in the Two 
Securities Centre building about 3 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32,  
who works on the building's third floor. ``There was a trail of 
blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the  
All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont 
Center. Five died there. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, ``made comments  
to the extent that it was a bad trading day and something to the 
effect that it was going to get worse,'' Atlanta Police Chief 
Beverly Harvard said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been a customer of both firms.  
</P>
<P>
	Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting  
at her computer when she heard shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the  
first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms. Jones told WSB-TV. ``He 
was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings. The 
bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I 
was able to escape,'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was  
and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him. 
Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; 
some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded  
ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51. ``We had no idea what was 
going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's unoccupied minivan was eventually spotted by security  
guards at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, said 
Cobb County police Cmdr. D.E. Cook. Around the same time, Barton 
approached a woman in the parking lot and attempted to take her 
vehicle, telling her he would shoot her if she screamed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to run away and contact security,'' police  
spokesman Dana Pierce said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton returned to his van and police began following him north  
on Interstate 75. The rampage ended when Barton shot himself as 
police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles 
northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Mayor Bill  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harvard said two weapons, a 9 mm Glock and a .45-caliber  
Colt, and a duffel bag full of ammunition were recovered from 
Barton's van. The Glock was registered to Barton, who bought it in 
1993, but the Colt was registered to someone in Texas, and ``we are 
not sure why or how Mr. Barton came into possession,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first wife -- the mother of the children who were slain  
this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in 
Cedar Bluff, Ala. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the No. 1 suspect all the way through and still was,''  
said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks,  
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor. ``He apparently  
was concerned about losses, at least expressed that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in  
equity to open an account. To cope with the stress, the company 
employs a psychotherapist to help traders. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were  
open. Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers -- red carnations, 
yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card 
that said, ``I'm so sorry. God bless you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance  
Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a 
break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said  
Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed. 
``Unfortunately true.''
