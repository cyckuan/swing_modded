<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine
people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter
filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as
to what caused his three-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no excuse, no good
reason. I am sure no one will understand. If they could I wouldn't
want them to. I just write these things to say why,'' read a
portion of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated
Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged
second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat
and drowned his two children the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was
killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer,
chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the
three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to pains to conceal the body so you can't help but
think the kids were in and out during that time,'' Mercer said.
Barton's wife was found in a closet in the apartment home.
</P>
<P>
   Barton walked Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms
where he traded and fired randomly at traders and employees. Nine
died and 13 were wounded. Hours later, he killed himself as police
pulled over his van.
</P>
<P>
   The letter indicates he killed his children from his first
marriage, Matthew, 11, and Michelle, 8, to save them from a painful
existence. Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely
beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993. Although Barton was
considered the prime suspect, he was never charged in that case and
denied any involvement in the letter he left.
</P>
<P>
   The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his
wife's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday. He gave
no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife
and the people at the companies for his depression.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at one of the businesses, Momentum Securities, said
Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning
June 9, and lost $105,000. The other business, All-Tech Investment
Group, would not release his trading history there.
</P>
<P>
   Barton made no reference to his trading in the letter but
mentioned his plan to kill others twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to
kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction. You
should kill me if you can,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter apparently was signed by Barton and contained names
and numbers of three people _ his mother, Gladys Barton; his
children's maternal grandfather, Bill Spivey; and an attorney, Joe
Fowler. At first authorities thought the three might be intended
targets but later decided they were just people to contact about
the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Barton, 44, shot himself to death in his
minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth, just
north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was found Thursday night lying on a coffee table in
the living room of Barton's estranged wife's apartment in
Stockbridge, about 30 miles south of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Three handwritten notes also were found on each of the bodies.
Each contained two sentences describing his love for each and
asking someone to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the letter were not released, but Mercer read the
letter to reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter was left in a very obvious place,'' Mercer said.
``We didn't have to do any searching. They (the letter and notes
with each body) were very visible from the time you walked in.''
</P>
<P>
   The printed letter was addressed ``To Whom It May Concern.'' It
began with a matter-of-fact tone: ``Leigh Ann is in the master
bedroom closet under a blanket. I killed her Tuesday night. I
killed Matthew and Michelle Wednesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote of the similarities between the deaths and those of
his first wife of 15 years, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her
mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59. They were hacked to death six
years ago in a camper at Lake Weiss, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``However I deny killing her and her mother. There is no reason
for me to lie now,'' Barton wrote. ``It just seemed like a quiet
way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five
minutes. I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them
facedown in the bathtub to make sure that they did not wake up in
pain, to make sure they were dead. I am so sorry. I wish I didn't.
Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I?''
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote only that he had ``been dying since October'' and
since then had terrifying dreams he could no longer live with. The
letter never explained what caused the dreams or his sense of
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   He only wrote: ``It has taken its toll. I have come to hate this
life in this system of things. I have come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his
children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed the children to exchange for them five minutes of
pain for a lifetime of pain,'' he wrote. ``I forced myself to do it
to keep them from suffering so much later. No mother, no father, no
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was
from my father to me and from me to my son. He already had it and
now to be left alone, I had to take him with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the children were found in the other bedroom of
the two-bedroom apartment. Each was lying in a separate bed with
blankets and bed coverings pulled up to their faces. A handwritten
note was lying on top of each bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any part of the body aside from just a square
portion of their face visible,'' Mercer said. ``It was almost like
they were sleeping. There was certainly not any visible blood that
I saw... We saw some blood splatters on the wall, but it also
appeared to be this individual went to some extreme in terms of
trying to clean up the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of
shrine in tribute to each. Next to Matthew's body was a video game,
and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
</P>
<P>
   But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for
my demise, as I plan to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't
killed her now. She really couldn't help it, and I love her so much
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Several draft versions of the letter were found on the computer
in the home, Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   That Barton's depression led him to kill at home and the
workplace is unusual, said John Vincent, a professor of psychology
at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said. ``This
pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee
seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at
the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were
profiting at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said. Despite
the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying, authorities
there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and
Eloise Spivey to be closed now.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had taken out a $600,000 in life insurance on his first
wife before her death and eventually settled with the insurance
company for $450,000, according to federal court records obtained
by The Associated Press. About $150,000 was to be held in trust for
his children. After legal fees, Barton was left with $194,000.
</P>
<P>
   The AP also reported that Barton lived in Texarkana, Texas, in
the late 1980s and was fired from his job as president of TLC
Manufacturing after a burglary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the handguns Barton used in the spree, a Colt
.45-caliber, was traced to a North Texas gun dealer, police said,
and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983. Barton
registered the other, a 9 mm Glock, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton's shooting
spree in Atlanta, Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of
Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities
would continue to search for a motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a number of people for a long period of time
trying to put the pieces to the puzzle together to find out why it
is that Mr. Barton was provoked to the extent that he was, that he
felt the need to take out as many people as he did,'' Mercer said.
``I don't have those answers at this time and I doubt anyone else
does either.''
