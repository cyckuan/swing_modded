 &HT;    Barton visited lawyer to update will on day of shootings

   ATLANTA _ With his slain wife stuffed into a closet at home and
the battered bodies of his children tucked into their beds, Mark
Barton paid a cordial visit to his lawyer Thursday morning to
update his will.
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, Barton went on to commit the worst
slaughter in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have beady eyes or a stubbly beard or anything like
that,'' said Joe Fowler, a prominent attorney in Douglas County
with deep roots in the community. ``He just seemed real normal,
just talking. I guess he easily could have had a weapon with him.
The people in the office (looking back on the then-innocuous
meeting) are just freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a surreal episode in the spiraling end of a deranged man,
who, while struggling with internal demons that drove him to kill
himself and others, was also tying up loose ends _ just finishing
some errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd that someone who has done this would be able to act
with such deliberateness, such coldness,'' Fowler said of the
15-minute, otherwise forgetTable encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had also come to Fowler's office Monday to make
``routine'' changes to his will. He returned for the short visit
Thursday to again tinker with the document. It was concerning
simple matters that Barton did not even have to come in person to
do, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said Georgia State Bar Association guidelines
prohibit him from talking about the will until it is sent to court
to be probated. That will occur after a death certificate is signed
in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, Fowler was contacted by Henry County
police, who were concerned about his safety. Fowler's name was cc'd
on a note that Barton left in his apartment with the bodies. Fowler
and his staff were given police protection until Barton later
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fowler does not believe that Barton meant him any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Barton first approached Fowler not long after the 1993 slaying
of Barton's wife, Debra, and his mother-in-law, Eloise Spivey, for
help with some legal matters, including estate planning. Part of
that work later included a $450,000 settlement in 1997 from an
insurance company on a $600,000 policy Barton took out on his wife
two months before her slaying. About $150,000 went to Barton's two
children, Matthew, then 9, and Mychelle, then 6. The insurance
company initially fought the payment, accusing him of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Police also strongly suspected Barton of the savage bludgeoning
slayings, as did the Spivey family and others in Douglas County.
Fowler, a deeply Christian man, was ambivalent about his own
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard the talk and Mark did, too,'' said Fowler. ``As
a lawyer, you can't separate it. You cautiously presume the best
until shown otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him as a man in grief and my job was to help him with
the details to carry on living.''
