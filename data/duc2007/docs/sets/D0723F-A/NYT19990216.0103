   WASHINGTON _ This scandal that was, to many, all about sex and
the married man closes with an unexpected twist: Women come out
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Meager winnings, maybe, for the female leads in the yearlong
soap opera. Paula Jones got her money and a makeover. Monica S.
Lewinsky has a big book deal and bragging rights for a boffo
performance before the House impeachment managers. Even the
vilified Linda R. Tripp has embarked on a network TV
image-enhancement tour.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``the year of the woman candidate'' followed Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas's sexually charged confirmation
hearings in 1991, many think women will benefit politically from
Washington's toxic mix of sex, machismo, and partisanship that
ended Friday with President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
and Senator Dianne Feinstein suddenly are being touted as women who
can win high office in 2000 _ even though none has said she will be
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``For heaven's sake, look what we have been put through because
of the foibles of Washington's failed old-boy network,'' said
Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and
Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
``People think they can clean things up by electing a woman who is
more honest, more compassionate, more authentic, and, true or not,
not as prone to the kinds of sexual peccadillos that men are.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Dole, a two-time Republican Cabinet secretary and the
recently retired head of the American Red Cross, debuted on the
political stage with a speech in New Hampshire that included
several references to her gender and repeated calls for restoring
integrity and moral leadership in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little speculation that I might run for
president,'' said Dole, who is expected to formally announce her
intention to do that this week. ``If I run, this will be an
important reason why: The United States deserves a government that
is worthy of her people.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Dole, who is married to former senator Bob Dole, the
1996 presidential candidate, not only has a shot at the top of the
GOP White House field but also would defeat Vice President Al Gore
in a head-to-head matchup today.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, nobody was giving any serious consideration to
Hillary Clinton's running for public office. But her dignified
handling of a public embarrassment, a political crisis, and
certainly, a personal ordeal, won Mrs. Clinton a combination of
respect and sympathy that sent her once-sagging popularity through
the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also dived into last fall's elections, campaigning
where her beleaguered husband couldn't and proving that she could
pump up huge crowds and make the difference for Democrats in tight
races. Now she is being wooed by New York Democrats to run for an
open Senate seat in 2000
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wait and see, give her time,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's press secretary. ``She has not ruled it in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the first lady is ``gracious and listens'' to New
Yorkers who are promoting her candidacy, but she refuses to discuss
it, or even think about it, until the impeachment issue is gone.
President Clinton, however, brought it up at a recent fund-raising
dinner in Manhattan, quipping that he might be remembered as ``the
person who comes with Hillary to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's political standing has vastly improved, but isn't it
a terrible irony that people who didn't like her because of her
independence, intelligence, and ambition, found her a much more
sympathetic character after she was taken down and humanized as a
humiliated wife?'' said Wendy Kaminer, an author and public policy
fellow at Radcliffe College.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, said she thinks Mrs. Clinton ``has an agenda, and she is out
there stirring things up.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW also is poised to stir things up. Its political action
committee met this week to plan ways to promote Feinstein,
California's senior senator, as vice president on the Democratic
ticket in 2000. One idea is to have NOW members show up at campaign
events featuring Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley
with placards that say ``Democrats Deserve Dianne,'' and
``Countdown to D (Dianne)-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said NOW officials had not spoken to Feinstein, a proven
money-raiser from a state rich with electoral votes, but she did
not expect her to ``run from the room and slam the door'' on a vice
presidential draft. Feinstein has gotten attention as a tough and
persistent critic of the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we learned in the last year is that it is entirely
possible to have an administration that is good on the issues and
on appointing women and still have a streak of sexism a mile
wide,'' said Ireland, in an effort to justify NOW's push to get the
second woman on the Democratic ticket. Former representative
Geraldine Ferraro of New York was the first, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, President Clinton put women who shared his
politics _ his wife, Democratic lawmakers, and feminist activists _
on the spot by his relationship with Lewinsky. The president became
a campaign issue last fall for Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of
California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois, who defended Clinton's record but said they deplored his
conduct. Boxer and Murray were reelected; Moseley-Braun was not.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist leaders were accused of hypocrisy for loudly
championing sexual-harassment laws but staying silent when such
charges were brought against a president who advocated for women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Democratic women in the House or Senate had turned against
him, if feminist groups had abandoned him, or if his wife had
indicated at any point that she did not stand by him, it could have
been a turning point and tipped the public scales against the
president,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the
Advancement of Public Policy, a liberal advocacy group for women.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Burk said, ``it's definitely pay-back time.'' Women's
groups want the White House to act quickly on their issues:
legislation guaranteeing women equal pay for equal but not
identical work, improved child care, and recognition of the special
needs of older women in any Social Security overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that doesn't happen, women who stood by the president are
going to be supremely disgusted and look beyond the Democratic
Party, particularly if Republicans put forward a good female
candidate next year,'' Burk said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has said she is not interested in the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket, but three Republican female senators emerged as leaders and
up-and-comers in the party during the impeachment trial. Senator
Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas led an unsuccessful campaign to open
the Senate's final, secret deliberations. Maine's two senators,
Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins, teamed up to seek bipartisan
agreement on a finding of fact proposal to rebuke the president.
That effort failed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland might try to enlist the Republican women in what she
says will be a major effort this year to get Congress to strengthen
sexual-harassment laws and beef up the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission for better enforcement of civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make every effort to capitalize on the
Republican Congress's recently expressed and newfound interest in
sexual-harassment laws and enforcement,'' Ireland said. ``Over and
over they said, `We care.' We say, `Fine, show us.' ''
