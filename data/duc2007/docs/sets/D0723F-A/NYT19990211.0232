   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she will vote
against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors
failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President
Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to
this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present
danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said
during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday. Her
office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for
the people of the United States, should not be convicted and
removed from office,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out
a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an
alternative to conviction. She has formed an unlikely alliance with
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, to build support for a censure
resolution, though it appeared Thursday that their effort was
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the
Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions
threaten the function of government.
</P>
<P>
   Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House
(prosecutors) established beyond a reasonable doubt that this
president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to
file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit. House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove
this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her
to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her
affidavit, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie,
but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky
and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were
marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more
innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment
process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand
jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses
during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of
Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular,
well-respected president (who) has strong support must be
considered.'' In the international arena, removing Clinton would be
``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and
indefensible,'' Feinstein said. ``It sent the wrong message to the
nation and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   While it does not threaten the security and stability of the
nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and
censure, and there should be a formal means for senators ... to
express this condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a
``legislative measure'' through which senators could express
``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a
message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton. But
unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over
censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,''
she said. ``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opposition to censure is growing, presenting a high
hurdle to Feinstein and other censure advocates. Moving a censure
resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67
votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said. ``I would hope at
the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said.
