DIANNE FEINSTEIN ANNOUNCES BID FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2000

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision
not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of
intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her
plans for re-election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senator said Thursday that she will seek
re-election in 2000, and will begin the effort later this month
with a fund-raiser in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I didn't run for governor is that I want to
continue in the Senate,'' Feinstein said Thursday in an interview.
``I believe I can continue to be effective in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   After three statewide campaigns in the 1990s, the 64-year-old
former San Francisco mayor has become one of the most recognized
and popular politicians in the state. Feinstein is frequently
mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic
presidential nominee in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not planning on that happening. . . . It's not a
possibility at this stage,'' Feinstein said. ``At this point,
everything in me is going to work toward continuing in the United
States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no Californian has ever done it, state election
officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at
the same time. Were she to win both elections, Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, would appoint a temporary replacement until voters elect
a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, bolstered by their strong showing in last month's
elections, believe they have a chance to regain control of the
Senate in 2000. Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 advantage,
but Democrats hold fewer of the seats up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and has earned
a reputation as a no-nonsense centrist who works well with
Republicans as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Her fiercest critics have been civil libertarians, who have
decried her efforts to restrict information on the Internet
(ranging from the dissemination of personal data to instructions on
how to build bombs) and gun advocates, who oppose her ban on
assault weapons, which was passed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans have expressed an interest in the seat,
including Rep. Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, who recently transferred
campaign contributions into a Senate campaign account in order to
keep his options open. Other Republican candidates mentioned as
possible contenders include Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., California
Secretary of State Bill Jones and State Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire Al Checchi, who made a bid for the Democratic
nomination for governor earlier this year, laid to rest rumors that
he might be interested in challenging Feinstein in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be senator,'' Checchi said Thursday from his
Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein estimated that she will need to raise at least $15
million to defend her seat, and will begin the process with a
women's event in San Francisco later this month. Large fund-raising
events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles
early next year. Feinstein has enlisted the help of longtime
political advisers Kam Kuwata and Bill Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that may boost her chances for re-election, Feinstein
has reclaimed her seat on the influential Senate Appropriations
Committee, which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual discretionary
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Feinstein gave her seat on the committee to Sen.
Barbara Boxer as a way to help her fellow California Democrat's
chances for re-election. Boxer used the position to help lobby for
_ and then boast about _ tens of millions of dollars for California
projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San
Francisco Bay. Boxer will now take Feinstein's seat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her priorities for the next Congress, Feinstein said
she will push for the construction of new schools and work to
discourage the practice of ``social promotion,'' in which students
are moved from grade to grade without any testing of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she will revisit the issue of guns and may
introduce legislation to require child safety locks, regulate
``Saturday night specials,'' and close a loophole in the assault
weapons ban that permits the import of large bullet clips.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate may be consumed with a trial of President Clinton if
the House approves articles of impeachment later this month, an
ordeal that she complained is evolving into ``Melrose Place on
Lafayette Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein initially issued an angry rebuke of Clinton after he
admitted to deceiving the nation about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Now, although open to a resolution to censure the
president, she has ``not seen anything'' to make her think Clinton
should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's extraordinarily important that this chapter be
closed. I think worldwide the United States looks worse and
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein will have a good opportunity to gauge the president's
reaction to the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry. She has
accepted a White House invitation to accompany Clinton on a trip to
the Middle East on December 12, the day the House Judiciary
Committee is expected to complete its impeachment proceedings.
