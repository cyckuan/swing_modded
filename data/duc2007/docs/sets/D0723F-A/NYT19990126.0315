   WASHINGTON _ Some Senate Democrats said Tuesday they will
seriously consider a resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D.-Calif., condemning President Clinton's conduct in trying to
cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate,
lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that
Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed
to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's resolution would censure him for both having the
affair and then concealing it from his cabinet, other government
officials and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of
justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but
instead focuses on presidential misconduct. The resolution neither
clears the president of criminal behavior nor implicates him.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had
agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two
articles of impeachment now being tried.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Feinstein's resolution is the first
of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will
consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the
resolution. He added that lawmakers need to find the exact,
appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional
muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was
appropriate,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said many senators feel that if Clinton
is acquitted, ``something needs to be on the record'' that condemns
him for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans have said they won't back such a
measure. For instance, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, has argued that
the Senate cannot censure a president because it would violate the
separation-of-powers clause in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure
option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of
impeachment. Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have
45 seats. A simple majority vote would be needed to approve a
censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's measure would be considered as a non-binding
resolution that does not require a House vote or Clinton's
signature. Both the House and Senate often approve non-binding
resolutions on various subjects such as supporting U.S. troops in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats maintain that if a censure resolution is non-binding,
it will not pose any constitutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never
get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply
vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against
Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Feinstein's proposal, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
said it now appears that witnesses will be called and that there's
no way to tell if censure will come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start a trial process, you don't know where and how
it's going to end,'' Schumer said. He added that the atmosphere is
likely to get highly partisan and ``that could damage the Senate
not just now but later on.''
