   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Democratic women senators headlined a
breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday to celebrate
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the U.S. Senate there are only nine of them, but
the speakers, including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work hard to elect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today are the major political force in this country,''
said Feinstein to the 150 guests, many of whom quickly erupted into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   When the cheering quieted, Feinstein said, ``I didn't see a
single man clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,852 people who have served in the United States Senate,
27 have been women, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Of the women,
12 served for a day or two to fill in for their husbands who had
just died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really proud that our husbands did not have to die in
order for us to serve,'' said Murray, who hosted the breakfast
sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has hosted numerous events this week at exclusive
locales, such as Spago. The breakfast Thursday was one of only
three events open to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the seemingly endless week of socializing and
political promoting were showing Thursday morning. Guests guzzled
coffee in preparation for the final day of convention activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, we should have scheduled (the breakfast) a
little earlier in the week or a little later in the morning,'' said
Ed Tobin, an executive at Microsoft who introduced Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said she's been so excited since she
arrived in Los Angeles that she lost her voice. But she quickly
found a doctor to fix her up. And who better than Barbra
Streisand's doc?
</P>
<P>
   The singer's doctor told her, ``If you follow these
instructions, you'll never be able to sing like Barbra, but you'll
be able to talk tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Landrieu's voice was still a little raspy, she gave a
quick speech and was off to the next event.
