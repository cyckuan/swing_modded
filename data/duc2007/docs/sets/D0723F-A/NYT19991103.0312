   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that
would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African
countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American
pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign
countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the
price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the
world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where
people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a
new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade
policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions,
a Washington advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be
significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost
$12,000 to $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs. access to
AIDS drugs began in 1997. That's when South Africa passed
legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms
by granting small local companies permission to produce their own
AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make
cheaper generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies
have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that
fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an
African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S. Trade
Representative to impose sanctions on Sub-Saharan African countries
that produce cheaper generic versions of U.S. AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., persuaded Republican
leaders to accept an amendment to the trade bill that would allow
those African countries to continue to produce their copycat AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said banning these generic AIDS drugs in Africa would
have caused needless suffering and death in countries where AIDS is
so widespread it is a public health emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have generic drugs, you effectively say that
people in Africa are not going to get the treatment that can
sustain life,'' Feinstein said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Senate floor, Feinstein said about 34 million
people in Africa _ about the size of the population of California _
are infected with HIV or AIDS. About one-third, or 11.5 million
these people, have died from the disease, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said those deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV and
AIDS-related deaths worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of AIDS in Africa is huge,'' Feinstein said. ``It
continues to be a major threat to the well being of the entire
African continent. ... It is clearly in the national interest to
prevent the further spread of HIV\AIDS in Africa,'' she said.
