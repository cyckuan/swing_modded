FEINSTEIN NOT LETTING UP, BUT SHE CAN BREATHE EASIER THIS
TIME  AROUND
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne
Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be
opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and
virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been biding her time during the primary campaign,
confidently preparing to take on Rep. Tom Campbell, the presumptive
Republican nominee, in November.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be as good as it gets in politics, but this is as
good as it has ever been for Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know me,'' she told the Chronicle during an interview
last weekend. ``We take the public trust very seriously, and I
think people believe, by and large, that I've honored my
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from 10 years ago, when Feinstein, now 67, was
running for governor and was booed at a state Democratic convention
for declaring her support for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was the outsider then, running for the nomination
against Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who had the support of
virtually every major state Democrat. She won the primary and lost
narrowly to Republican Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she ran for the Senate. She defeated John
Seymour, Wilson's hand-picked successor, and got more votes than
any Senate candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, because she was finishing Wilson's incomplete term,
Feinstein was on the ballot again, running for re-election against
Republican Rep. Michael Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington spent $30 million attacking Feinstein and came within
163,000 votes of defeating her.
</P>
<P>
   But today she holds a commanding lead in the polls: 5 to 1 over
Campbell in the most recent Field Poll, more than 2 to 1 over all
Republican opponents combined. Her support cuts across party lines,
cuts across ethnic and gender lines and runs the gamut of the
political spectrum. ``She's perceived as carrying herself with
dignity and grace, as a senator who's knowledgeable, on the job,
paying attention to what's going on,'' said pollster Mervin Field.
</P>
<P>
   A centrist who snubs the outer edges of political ideology,
Feinstein ``has not done or said anything that turns the California
public off,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Feinstein even seized the middle ground during the
impeachment controversy, expressing outrage at President Clinton's
personal conduct while maintaining support for his policies.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``the perfect position,'' said Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dianne has always appealed to the same middle everybody talked
about Clinton appealing to,'' said veteran Democratic strategist
Darry Sragow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took people a long time to figure that out because she was
the mayor of San Francisco, and they assumed she had to be a
liberal. She's always been a centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, she has benefited from the public perception that
Clinton's centrist policies have been effective in spurring the
nation's economic boom, and that she has been a consistent
supporter of legislation to drive down the federal budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   She also has benefited from one major centrist move by Clinton _
turning gun control into a tough-on-crime position, which Feinstein
has embraced as a central issue to her legislative career.
</P>
<P>
   She is at her most passionate when decrying the ``trickle-down
of guns to children'' and the ``nation awash in guns,'' and vowing
to push through yet more legislation that will regulate the sale
and distribution of handguns and assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity in California is one reason she is frequently
mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore,
should he win the Democratic presidential nomination. She would be
permitted to run for both vice president and senator on the same
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has endorsed Gore, but she declined to comment on the
possibility of running with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to it. If it were to happen, I'd
certainly think about it,'' she said. Feinstein also recalled that
she was mentioned in the same way in 1984, when then-Democratic
nominee Walter Mondale selected New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as
his vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Feinstein is sitting on a campaign treasury of more
than $2.6 million. She also has in place a veteran team of campaign
advisers, many of whom have been with her through all her campaigns
of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Her only opposition in the Democratic primary is Emeryville
attorney Michael Schmier, who admits he has no money with which to
mount a challenge against Feinstein. He is running largely to
protest the dwindling number of appellate cases that are published
for public review.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's time has been spent preparing for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her campaign spent nearly $900,000 on an intense
telemarketing campaign, signing up small donors in the $5 to $10
range who also will commit to doing volunteer work when it comes
time to turn out voters at the end of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the telemarketing effort has
raised more than $1.1 million in small donations and has generated
a list of more than 125,000 people who will serve as a grassroots
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to figure out if we're going to go on TV in
the primary. We haven't made that decision,'' said Kuwata.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein campaign officials say they want to see what kind of
advertising Campbell airs. He is expected to begin a statewide TV
advertising effort late this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell began his campaign with a call for replacing the income
tax with a national sales tax and allowing local governments to
initiate programs to provide free drugs to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   His unconventional proposals mystified Feinstein and her top
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of a strange candidate,'' said Feinstein media
consultant Bill Carrick. ``I don't take him for granted, but I
think the campaign will play itself out in less than traditional
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be much to the evident relief of Feinstein, who still
has unpleasant memories of the the race against Huffington, who ran
ads on television all but two weeks of the 11-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington's blitz began in January, when he bought a full
minute of TV prime time during the telecast of the Winter Olympics
and attacked Feinstein for her vote supporting the Clinton
administration's budget deficit reduction package.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was watching at home, and ``my gut went, `Oooohhh,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how her gut reacted when she saw that Campbell began this
campaign with a call for a national sales tax and a drug giveaway,
Feinstein said, ``My gut relaxed.''
