<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Sen. Barbara Boxer is fighting to
re-establish what some analysts say could be her greatest asset in
her race for re-election: incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign swing through California's fertile Central Valley,
the Democratic incumbent reminded voters of her service in
Washington over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot together,'' Boxer told 50 supporters Thursday at
an event in Stockton highlighting her support for the 1994 crime
bill, which provided funding for 173 new police officers in that
city. ``I want to keep us working together.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes as a new poll by the Los Angeles Times shows
Boxer pulling slightly ahead of her Republican opponent, state
Treasurer Matt Fong, by 5 percentage points, 49 percent to 44
percent, among those likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   That is seen as less a sign of a newfound popularity for Boxer
than proof the negative commercials she has begun running against
Fong on issues like abortion and the environment are cutting into
his support.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers have criticized Boxer for doing little
in her race against Fong to remind voters that she is a sitting
senator at a time when the economy is solid, crime is down and
voters are generally content.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to focus on what she has delivered for California,''
said Barbara O'Connor, communications professor at California State
University in Sacramento. ``She needs to highlight what she's been
able to bring home.''
</P>
<P>
   With just days before the election, both Boxer and Fong are
crisscrossing the state. Each is still furiously raising money in
order to plaster voters with expensive, last-minute television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   For Fong, the campaign has become nearly all fund-raising, with
rarely more than one public event a day. He explains that he has
held public events throughout the campaign, but must now focus on
securing cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a challenger, I need to raise the dollars to compete,''
Fong said after a $125,000 fund-raiser in San Francisco Wednesday
night. Citing the new barrage of negative ads against him, ``I have
to answer those charges, and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who adeptly used the President Clinton's affair with a
former White House intern to bash Boxer early in the race, is now
seeking to weaken her by linking her to labor unions and trial
lawyers, who have been among the largest contributors to her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon Wednesday at the San Jose Rotary Club, he accused
Boxer of siding with the trial lawyers who supported Proposition
211, a failed measure to allow shareholder lawsuits against
companies if their stock price plummeted. Many Silicon Valley
companies fought the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Boxer sided with labor union bosses in opposing
broader trade-negotiating powers for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Fong is counting on supporters like Helen Buckholtz, a Portola
Valley Republican, who said she supports Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a
Democrat, but won't vote for Boxer because she's ``too negative,
too partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's Central Valley campaign tour Thursday took her through
some areas where she has had little support in the past. In her
1992 election, her opponent, conservative television commentator
Bruce Herschensohn, out-polled her in several key Central Valley
counties: Fresno (55 percent to 37 percent), Merced (49 percent to
39 percent) and Madera (60 percent to 32 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A Public Policy Institute of California poll last week showed
Boxer trailing Fong in the more conservative Central Valley, but
had her in a dead heat with her Republican challenger statewide.
