FEINSTEIN PREDICTS PATIENTS' RIGHTS WILL BE A TOP CAMPAIGN ISSUE

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday
that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming
election as a result of Republicans scuttling her party's proposals
to boost patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a patients' bill of rights becomes a major campaign
issue,'' said Feinstein, who is running for reelection next year.
And, she said, ``I think it will be part of the presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the
wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including
one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health
plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who
contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular
stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular
Democratic amendments that would have let women in health
maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as
their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the
final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery
for breast cancer. Another Democratic initiative would have
guaranteed patients insured access to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to approve their own narrower bill on
Thursday on how to regulate managed care providers. But aides to
President Clinton have said they will recommend that he veto the
GOP version.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic proposals would lead to
escalating medical costs, increased insurance premiums and more
uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein told reporters that the issue of reining in managed
care organizations is especially important in California. There,
she said, doctors are filing for bankruptcy and hospitals are
closing at alarming rates, but managed care providers continue to
take in large profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, there are real problems,'' she said. ``I just
saw a list of new hospitals that will close shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Republicans offered their own managed care
proposals, including one designed to help women who are recovering
from breast cancer surgery. A measure by Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, would require that decisions on length of stay following a
mastectomy be determined by the patient and her own physician. Her
plan is similar to the Democratic proposal, but Republicans said
that measure was too vague. Republicans also planned to offer their
own measure regarding access to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein predicted that Democrats will win at the polls next
year by blaming Republicans, not only for rejecting Democratic
patients' rights proposals, but also for killing legislation that
would have regulated tobacco companies and tightened rules on gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   She accused the Republicans of having a ``pro-tobacco and
anti-health care reform kind of vision'' and said, ``I think the
dominant share of Americans are on the other side of these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said gun control will loom large in the campaign because of
evidence that juveniles are able to get firearms easily and bring
them into schools.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear need, she said, for ``targeted, prudent
regulation of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for
2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential
candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have established that women are taking an
historically unprecedented role in politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the speculation about her ``makes me
uncomfortable,'' because ``it builds up an expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be U.S. senator,'' Feinstein said. ``I intend to
serve another term. ... I can't see into the future ... but I want
to be a U.S. senator from California. The probability is very
strong that I will be a U.S. senator.''
