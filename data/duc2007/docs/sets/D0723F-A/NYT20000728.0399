 &HT;    Gore VP talk lacks mention of women
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, just as the Democratic presidential
primaries were nearing an anticlimactic end, the Clinton-Gore
administration boasted of its successes in advancing the political
standing of women since the U.N. conference on women's rights in
Beijing five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far in his very private process of selecting a running
mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready
to do just that by selecting a woman for the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket this year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as he began to narrow the number of vice presidential
candidates, Gore suggested that his long list included women,
though he was not specific. ``I think it's only fair to the men and
women involved to keep it private and dignified,'' he said of his
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any of the news accounts of Gore's selection process
speculated on the possibility of the vice president selecting a
woman. Most of the speculation centered on Sens. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tom
Harkin of Iowa, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a woman? Is it possible that Gore is haunted by
the ghost of 1984, when Vice President Walter Mondale picked a
little-known New York congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, and went on
to the greatest defeat in modern American politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' said Marla
Romash, a longtime political associate of Gore. ``It's more about
numbers than anything else. There just aren't that many women to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ranks of Democratic female politicians are so thin
that noted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has reached into the
ranks of lieutenant governors for a possible running mate for Gore.
Admittedly, Lake's candidate is no average lieutenant governor:
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice presidential selection process of both Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential
nominee, has generally rankled people who had hoped to see more of
a female presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows once again that women have an uphill battle in
politics as in any other field dominated by white males,'' said
Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and
Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same for women worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to a ``gender balanced'' presidential ticket,
``The political parties like to talk about viability _ or lack of
it,'' added Hawkesworth. ``But the fact is, there are plenty of
women who would be viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, who served in the
last two Republican Cabinets, was widely touted as a possible Bush
running mate. But the governor chose oil industry executive Dick
Cheney, a former congressman and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore coasted to victory in the Democratic primaries this
spring, generating a guessing game about a running mate, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California was mentioned frequently. A seasoned
politician and one of the best speakers in American politics today,
Feinstein has a generally _ but not uniformly _ liberal voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein is up for re-election this year. And she is from a
state that Gore could win this fall without her help. In addition,
she voted against NAFTA, one of the administration's major
accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn
President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's biggest problem (in selecting a female running mate) is
the size of the pool,'' said Jack Pitney, a political science
professor at Clarement-McKenna College in California.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic women account for just six senators, 39 House members
and one governor, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Like Feinstein
in the Senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for re-election _
two are leaving the House. Shaheen also is seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   The six Democratic senators average 19.8 years each in politics,
topped by Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 27 years; Feinstein, 26
years; and Barbara Boxer of California, 24 years. The six men most
mentioned as possible Gore running mates average 22.3 years each in
politics, with Graham at the top, 34 years, and Gephardt, 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Louise Slaughter of New York are
the Democratic women who have served the most consecutive years in
the House: Kaptur, 18, and Slaughter, 14. But neither has been
mentioned as a possible running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have Clinton Cabinet members Donna Shalala, Alexis
Herman or Janet Reno. (Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
barred by the U.S. Constitution from running because she was not
born in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's choice has to be perceived by most voters as
presidential,'' said Joel Goldstein, author of ``The Modern
American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Romash: ``You don't get on the list in a vacuum; you get
on the list by having years of experience in public service. And
we're still working to increase the number of women available to be
on the list.''
