SEN. FEINSTEIN WORKS TO SOLVE ENCRYPTION STANDOFF

   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to resolve bitter differences over
data encryption, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., brokered a
meeting Tuesday between several prominent high-tech executives and
top law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door discussion brought together for the first time
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and such
high-tech leaders as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to review the
data-scrambling technology, which keeps computer communications
private.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wants the FBI to be able to access encryption codes for
wire-tapping and other criminal investigations. The computer
industry contends that such efforts threaten privacy and free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also wants to maintain controls over
exports of U.S. encryption technology. The industry argues that the
controls put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, hamper
innovation and ultimately undermine their lead in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top
Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology,
terrorism and government information. Feinstein said in a statement
that she has ``developed a strong interest'' in encryption, and
that when she learned that Freeh ``had not had the opportunity to
talk directly with the CEOs of American high-tech companies
regarding his concerns,'' she offered to organize a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that when there are areas of
disagreement, it is helpful to bring the principals together to
talk face to face,'' said Feinstein, for ``frank and informal
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting allied Gates with some computer executives who have
frequently been his harshest critics _ Jim Barksdale, president of
Netscape; Scott McNealy, chief executive officer of Sun
Microsystems; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell _
as well as Steve Case, chief executive officer of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other law enforcement officials included Thomas Constantine,
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bobby Moody, president
of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and William
Murphy, president of the National District Attorneys Association.
All declined to divulge details about the meeting.
