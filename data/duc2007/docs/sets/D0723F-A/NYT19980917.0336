CALIFORNIA SENATOR SAYS CLINTON BETRAYED HER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since reading the special
prosecutor's report on President Clinton's affair with a onetime
intern, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal
sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the
president about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein, D-Calif., said talk about whether Clinton should
resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional
investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed
to play out.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a
loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and
disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
</P>
<P>
   She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the
1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only
increases animosity'' from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an intern,'' Feinstein said, referring to Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. ``This was something while he was
president. That's its pertinence. The fact that it was in the White
House, in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., has acknowledged the affair occurred. It took
place in the 1960s, before Hyde ran for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton's
aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I didn't want to talk to the president,'' Feinstein
said. ``I was angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president
but has consulted on other matters with members of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein,
who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has
assiduously courted throughout his presidency. ``This is the kind
of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and
disappointment from what I have to do as a senator.'
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and
the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of
Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct. But
most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from
office because of an extramarital relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a
videotape of the president's Aug. 17 testimony before the federal
grand jury investigating his conduct. After the testimony, Clinton
went on national television and admitted having an extramarital
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that adds light to the situation and is
pertinent to the situation, it might be a wise thing to do,''
Feinstein said. ``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I
don't think that's what it should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be
bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether
Clinton committed impeachable offenses. The Starr report accused
the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice
in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can have a relatively short process,'' Feinstein
said. ``I hope it does not drag on for a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from
Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index
finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he
had ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the
statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed
that for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed it and I believed it totally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to
convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more
certain.
</P>
<P>
   But then she was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``On August 17, when I heard the statement, my world came
crashing down,'' Feinstein said. ``I feel a personal sense of
betrayal. I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the
president's credibility was badly ``shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls
from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made
public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are in tears, some are irate and some are
extraordinarily supportive of the president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a long, long tail on it. It's not just the president.
It's the future of the American presidency too.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is to survive the scandal, ``he will need to show he
will continue to be a strong president,'' Feinstein said. ``That's
where the jury's out.''
