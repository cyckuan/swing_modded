   Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday
to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to
list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's
permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other
users listed on Napster's Internet site.

   Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an
interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's
lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer
users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for
copyright infringement. He said that the names had been gathered
and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do
anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific
information about which Napster Web site users were involved.

   Napster, through a lawyer, said Tuesday that it would review the
papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified
if the claims had been properly submitted. The statement, issued by
Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco lawyer, went on to say that the
result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.

   Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., functions as a
meeting place for computer users willing to share their music files
over the Net.
