 New Call to Ban Napster On Campus  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista and Kelly Yamanouchi 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The lawyer representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in
lawsuits against Napster Inc. has asked Stanford University, the
University of California at Berkeley and more than two-dozen other
colleges to ``promptly ban'' the popular file sharing program.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Howard E. King sent letters to the
universities this week after reading a San Francisco Chronicle
story that said most colleges were not restricting student use of
Napster, which he said allows ``piracy on a massive scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect some universities will take this opportunity to have
a discussion of the issue,'' King said Friday. ``There's been a lot
of public discussion about the morality and the legality of
Napster. I think colleges, being the hotbed of Napster activity,
are the appropriate place to have that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   King gave the universities about two weeks to respond but said
he is not threatening legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without the threat of litigation from artists and other
copyright owners, I believe that you can easily recognize the irony
of encouraging your students to matriculate in the creative arts
while engaging in behavior which, if unchecked, will make it
impossible for those students to earn an income from their future
creative efforts,'' King wrote in a letter to Harvard University
President Neil L. Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pending copyright infringement lawsuits Metallica and
Dr. Dre filed against the San Mateo, Calif., startup in April named
three colleges as defendants and left room for others to be added.
</P>
<P>
   The three colleges named, the University of Southern California,
Yale University and Indiana University, were dropped as defendants
after they banned Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several colleges notified this week by King,
including the University of Virginia, UCLA, UC Berkeley and
Stanford, said they will discuss the request before deciding
whether to take action.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley ``does take seriously any notification we get of
copyright infringement,'' said Mike Smith, assistant chancellor for
legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Stanford legal counsel Debra Zumwalt said their
universities have received complaints of copyright violations in
the past, usually involving incidents like music, text or photos
posted without permission on student Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy to date has been if there is evidence of copyright
infringement brought to us, we act on that,'' Zumwalt said.
However, she said, the school so far has not banned ``access to any
particular site of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Napster fans are violating copyright law is also a
central part of Napster's defense in a federal copyright
infringement suit filed by the country's biggest record labels. The
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear the case
Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``These letters are a heavy-handed attempt by Metallica's
lawyers to increase university bans as part of their effort to shut
down Napster,'' company Chief Executive Officer Hank Barry said in
a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who engage in person-to-person file sharing are not
copyright infringers, and we hope that, while the litigation is
pending, schools would not be intimidated by Metallica and limit
the freedom of students to participate in the Napster community.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who use Napster or similar programs like Scour said
they shouldn't, and likely wouldn't, be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Napster were illegal, the school would have the right to
ban access to it,'' said UC Berkeley student Jim Wu. ``But until it
is illegal, I don't think the school has a right to ban access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think that restricting access to Napster is
going to restrict people's way of getting free music off the
Internet. It might be a little harder, but people will still find
ways to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA student James Papasin says Napster promotes CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably don't have a right to restrict access, but of
course they can do whatever they want,'' Papasin said. ``We're
college students; we should have access to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the record companies filed a brief with
the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco supporting a lower
court's preliminary injunction that could shut Napster completely.
</P>
<P>
   And the Motion Picture Association of America and 19 other
organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the
injunction against Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one voice, we band together to send a simple and clear
message: It is wrong to build a business that relies on the theft
of copyrighted materials, and we oppose Napster's business model
for doing just that,'' MPAA President Jack Valenti said in a news
release.
