IN VICTORY FOR RECORDING INDUSTRY, JUDGE BARS ONLINE MUSIC SHARING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a
federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to
stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the
major music labels.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down
the service.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction,
Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S. District Court in San Francisco
ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used
primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said
Napster knew about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and
upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday
and will continue pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become the rallying point for competing interests
in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers,
consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely. And
legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond
music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a
tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would
immediately appeal. He said that Napster did not have the ability
to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented
copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
</P>
<P>
   This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply
and still operate,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, interim chief executive of Napster, held an Internet
Webcast to address the ruling to Napster's users; the company says
20 million people have downloaded its software.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry declared the decision a major and
complete victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends the message to others who are building businesses
based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,''
said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said
Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist
Dr. Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster. King called the
decision a ``huge win.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond
requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could
suffer from being shut down pending the trial. Napster had asked
for a bond of at least $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif., makes
software that allows computer users to download free software that
in turn lets them post the lists of music files they store on their
own computers. Other Napster users then can listen to or download
music kept on others' computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like
Gnutella, have grown, too. Last week, the recording industry and
the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour
Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users
download music and video files.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner
Inc., the Sony Corp., Bertelsmann and other record companies,
represented by the recording association, sued the service for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents major record labels,
asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
The industry contends that Napster has built a business by
encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not
own.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and
therefore it is doing nothing wrong. Rather, the company says, they
are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all
along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale
infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical
personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from
making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they
might ordinarily pay for.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording
industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within
six months. The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded
14,000 songs a minute. ``This is the most egregious case of massive
copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a
record label lawyer, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case
against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted
because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's
uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do
not have copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Boies cited the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was
not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax
videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of
substantial noninfringing uses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patel did not accept the argument. ``While Napster may be
capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to
what Napster was created for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's
impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
</P>
<P>
   One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of
Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used
Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association
commissioned from the Field Research Corp., a San Francisco-based
research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of
Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the
effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the
studies presented were ``without flaws.''
