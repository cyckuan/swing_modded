 METALLICA HEATS UP INTERNET DISPUTE WITH NAPSTER  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich plans to visit
Napster Inc. on Wednesday to deliver a gift: a list of 335,435
Napster users who the heavy metal band claims has offered illegal
copies of Metallica songs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica, which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San
Mateo, Calif., startup, wants Napster to block further access to
all of the users on the 60,000-page list, a request Napster says it
might honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put Napster out of business, or at least out
of the copyright infringement business,'' Metallica attorney Howard
E. King said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Napster created software that allows people to share and swap
MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M
Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in
damages. The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and
racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica
songs on the Internet without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by
rap artists Dr. Dre and the Recording Industry Association of
America trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the
University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana
University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by
their students. But each institution was dropped from the suit
after blocking Napster permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the
suit. However, King said Napster officials said they would block
any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to
monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30. The
firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of
five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members
and enough information to identify the users' computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded
during that period, but King said the band contends any song
offered by Napster users is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at
noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the
60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes. Metallica sent
invitations to media organizations saying that ``all coverage is
welcome and questions will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what this litigation is about is a public education
process, too,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   But King said the band does not intend to sue each of the
Napster users on the hit list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the band's intention to kick the rear ends of people
who have a few files here and there,'' King said. ``The goal here
is not to intimidate the fans. The goal is to stop Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company would accept
Ulrich's list and review it to determine if any users needed to be
booted off the service.
