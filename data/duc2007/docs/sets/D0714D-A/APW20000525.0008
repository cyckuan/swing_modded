<HEADLINE> Disc Sales Hurt by Music Downloads  </HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The music industry has some fresh ammunition in
its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has
cut into music sales.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Wednesday showed that sales of recorded music
near college campuses declined by 4 percent between the first three
months of 1998 and the same period this year. Sales at all stores
went up 12 percent during the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings come as no surprise and confirm our worst
fears,'' said Amy Weiss, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry
Association of America. ''This demonstrates the importance of
protecting artists' rights on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of colleges have banned the use of Napster, the leading
service that allows people to download music files for free from
the Internet, after heavy use clogged their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster,
alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade
copyrighted music online without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned by Reciprocal Inc., a digital rights
management company, and uses figures from Soundscan, the company
that measures music purchases. It is the most extensive attempt to
try to document whether downloading affects sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's clear that it has had an impact,'' said Michael
Fine, Soundscan's chief executive. He said it's hard to quantify
how much potential revenue music companies may have lost because of
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Napster and Scour.net, another company that
locates audio files on the Web, had no immediate comment on the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may have cut into music sales near college
campuses, including the growing popularity of devices that make CD
copies, Fine said. The music business has been dominated in the
past two years by Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync,
artists who appeal to a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reciprocal found that the sales decline was even steeper --
more than 7 percent -- when it studied outlets within five miles of
the 67 colleges that had banned Napster by late February.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores near colleges jumped by 12 percent between 1997
and 1998, before beginning a slide that coincided with the booming
popularity of Napster, Reciprocal said.
