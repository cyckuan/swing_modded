   In February, when Texas Christian University administrators
decided to block their Web-surfing students from entering a site
called Napster, they did so because the site was causing the
campus' computers to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   So many students were logging onto Napster to download MP3 files
_ electronic versions of songs _ that the computer's server kept
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded hardware was eventually installed, lessening the
problem, but the Napster music-community site remains off-limits to
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to turn Napster back on, it wouldn't be a
(computer) problem,'' says Dave Edmondson, assistant provost for
the school's information service department. ``Now it's a copyright
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, a very big one.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, the controversy swirling around the
San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster and whether it infringes on
copyright laws has been the hot topic in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bands, record labels and music lovers are divided on the
subject. Napster supporters, such as Public Enemy singer Chuck D,
champion the site for offering artists without major-label deals or
radio play a chance to get heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the radio of the new millennium,'' the vocalist said
during an interview this year at the South by Southwest music and
media conference in Austin. ``So many artists don't get a chance to
be on the radio or MTV, or be on a major label. This is how they
get heard. Why would you wanna deny them that?''
</P>
<P>
   For young people like Jennifer Cooper, an 18-year-old TCU
freshman, it's a dream come true. ``I've stopped buying CDs now
because of Napster and MP3s,'' she says. ``Who wants to pay for
music when you can get it for free?''
</P>
<P>
   Napster critics say, however, that the site breaks copyright
laws. When users download songs onto either their hard drive or a
CD, they get the song, but the artist doesn't get any money.
Critics liken it to walking into a music store and stealing a
record.
</P>
<P>
   That's why artists such as Metallica, which sued Napster in
April, and rap star Dr. Dre have started a campaign against
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's suit has gone to extremes: The group members
recently delivered to the court the names of 335,000 people whom
the band accuses of illegally obtaining its songs through the site.
Band drummer Lars Ulrich personally wheeled in the 60,000 pages of
text. The group released a statement saying the alleged violations
of its music were logged by a computer consulting firm, NetPD.
</P>
<P>
   Through various chat rooms and message boards, an ever-growing
circle of Metallica fans has trashed the band's legal actions. On
Napster's Web site, one fan wrote that the name of one of the
band's CDs, Master of Puppets, perfectly epitomized the metal
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Metallica versus the Internet,'' Ulrich said
in a statement on the band's Web site. ``We know that the Internet
is the future in terms of spreading your music to your fans, and
we're excited about that. But we want to control how that's done,
just like we've always controlled what we make.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because
it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that
they're going in this direction,'' Napster's founder, 19-year-old
Shawn Fanning, said in a statement. ``If we got the opportunity to
explain to the band why Napster exists and why fans enjoy Napster,
perhaps we could bring all of this to a peaceful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokeswoman Deborah Orr estimates the number of people
using Napster totals in the millions. Users simply log onto
Napster's site, do a search for a particular song and, when they
find another user who has it, trade one of their tracks for the one
they want. With the click of a mouse, the songs are either stored
on the computer's hard drives or transferred to CD via CD burners.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that's troubling the music industry: Sometimes,
Napster users get hold of material that hasn't been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to a friend and said, `Hey, you wanna copy of
our new record?''' Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas said in a
recent phone interview. ``And he was like, `Well, I've already
heard half of it.' He got it all off the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is ambivalent about Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a band that hasn't been as fortunate as us,
that's who it's good for. It gives them a chance to get heard,''
Thomas says. ``But for bands like us, it's like people are hearing
our stuff but we're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Durst of the immensely popular rap-metal act Limp Bizkit,
whose upcoming tour is being sponsored by Napster, says Napster's
the wave of the future, and his band's gonna ride it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could (not) care less about the older generation's need to
keep doing business as usual,'' he said at a news conference
announcing the launch of the tour, which will roll into the Bronco
Bowl in Dallas on July 22-23. ``We care more about what our fans
want, and our fans want music on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle will rage for months, until it is decided in the
courts. In the meantime, Napster is still up and running _ although
TCU has banned it _ and Cooper says she will keep downloading songs
wherever she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure, it's not fair that they're (the artists) not
making any money off of it,'' she says. ``But it's not like the
music industry is morally right in the first place. I'm sorry, but
I don't agree with having to pay $18 for a new CD.''
