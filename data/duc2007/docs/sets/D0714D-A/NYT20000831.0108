<P>
   My late father often entertained cops at his secondhand store on
the west side of Chicago. They popped in to make sure he wasn't
peddling stolen goods. When they left, Daddy didn't go with them,
so I assume he was clean, or at least very clever.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations
would have come to his defense. But some purveyors of stolen goods
have friends in high places. Just look at who's going to bat for
Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge
Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against
Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of
their favorite tunes without paying for them. Essentially, Patel
agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's
primary business is the facilitation of thievery. She ordered
Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned
legal team an opportunity to recoup. Meanwhile, an extraordinary
group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a
conservative group best known for its successful campaign against
the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange
of ideas over the Internet. They warn that corporations may use the
Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its
intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide
authorized links on Ritalin?'' this brief thunders. ``The outcome
would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively
silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record companies aren't complaining about people who
post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album. They're upset
about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to
facilitate such theft. Consider the following quote from a Napster
official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but
pushing demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a
powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics
Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP;
Communications Industry Association. Among them, these three groups
represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer
hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped
write this amicus brief. It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing
defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster
should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists. Still, their
argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a
point with a good deal of merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some
obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be
a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie
studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette
recorders?
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony
Corp. for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders. The
Betamax machines were a license to steal, the movie moguls alleged.
People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV
programs that would cost the studios billions. There was only one
solution _ ban Betamax.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed. Fortunately,
the US Supreme Court stepped in. In 1984, the court ruled that even
if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property,
the devices also had many legitimate uses. It would therefore be
foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel
didn't try to ban Napster. Her ruling leaves the company free to
offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital
music.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom
tells you all you need to know. It's a tacit admission of the
obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet
ensure that the music thefts will continue. But that doesn't change
the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for
forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot
merchandise generally get burned.
