 METALLICA, FANS BANG HEADS OVER FREE ONLINE MUSIC  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto
the streets of San Mateo, Calif., Wednesday as Metallica drummer
Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and
controversial music-sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the
Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc. to deliver the names of
335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs
available for free downloads last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and
photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off
those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who
shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica,
Ulrich debated with a Napster fan. And after Ulrich left, a
longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of
Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet?'' asked
the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last
name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is
seeking $10 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who
believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties
and their livelihoods. On the other side are fans, who say the
greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their
ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the
middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will
review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by
Ulrich and attorney Howard E. King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take
the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has
identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized
form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to
create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific
artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's
notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for
any music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows
fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into
the MP3 compression format.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre have filed separate civil suits
claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it
is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital
Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored
Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435
Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free
download. The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica
hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster members were identified by their user names, which
they gave Napster when they registered to download the program,
along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their
numerical Internet Protocol address.
</P>
<P>
   Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by
Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders
from reregistering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting
down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we
will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and
admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of
Napster users as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding
behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just
go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We
want online music to be on our conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old
Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif., home to give
Ulrich a piece of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very
selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped
him from buying CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country. Randy
Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why
Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not
so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge
and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will
ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney
with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list
of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have
something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to
start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,''
Doney said.
