 &HT;    Get a load of Napster quickly

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Juan Uribe wasn't caught napping.
</P>
<P>
   He was online, of course, when he electronically got the news
from cnn.com that a federal judge was ordering Napster Inc. to shut
down its Web site that has spawned millions of music trades on the
Internet. Deadline: midnight today.
</P>
<P>
   The next address Uribe typed in was ``www.napster.com'' _ and
there he stayed for about the next five hours, getting a steady
stream of complimentary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out immediately and we said, 'We've got to get on,
we've got to get on, we've got to get all that we can right now,'''
said Uribe. In all, Uribe said he downloaded about 75 songs, from
hip-hop artist Jay-Z to Colombian musician Carlos Vives, in
anticipation of a possible Napster shutdown. Not bad, said Uribe,
who was at work as a computer systems engineer in Fort Lauderdale
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed us to get a lot of stuff for free,'' he said of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   A judge hearing a lawsuit filed by the recording industry
granted an injunction Wednesday that would effectively shut down
Napster Friday night for infringing on copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyers asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
stay the order, arguing that the decision would bring down the
company and force it to lay off its 40 employees within days.
</P>
<P>
   Local punk-rockers, folk-lovers, classic-rock buffs _ they all
sounded off about the judge's ruling and the future of music, and
they got in some last-minute downloading as Napster's hours quickly
dwindled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site
and to download their own tunes _ for nothing. Users can also share
music tastes with each other in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The site had increased traffic Thursday, but no specific numbers
were available and no system problems were reported, said Tracy
Mlakar, spokeswoman for San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 70 million people were expected to be using Napster
by year's end unless the service is halted, U.S. District Judge
Marilyn Hall Patel said the San Mateo, Calif.-based company was
encouraging ``wholesale infringing'' against industry copyrights
and would likely lose at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America sued Napster in
December, accusing it of creating a musical black market online.
The association estimates that song-swapping via Napster by an
estimated 20 million people worldwide has cost the music industry
more than $300 million in lost sales. The heavy metal band
Metallica also sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're elated,'' Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said. ``Sharing
is such a warm, cuddly, friendly word . . . this is not sharing,
it's duplicating.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder Shawn Fanning, who started Napster (his nickname in high
school, a reference to his ``nappy'' frizzy hair) last year while a
student at Northeastern University in Boston, said in a short
Webcast, ``We will keep fighting for Napster and for your right to
share music over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a real drag to 15-year-old Jamie Warren. Now, he
said, how's he going to promote his band, Benjamin Distasteful and
the Wumberlogs? He'd hoped some free samples on Napster, a
high-profile venue, could give the band a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metallica started this whole stupid thing and complaining, but
they have millions of dollars so I don't know why they have to
complain about it,'' Warren said. He said he'd downloaded several
songs by Thursday afternoon since hearing the news, and he planned
on getting a few more before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Napster gives him access to hard-to-find songs you can't get
from the radio or many record stores. Like music from The Misfits
and Discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll use other sites that offer downloads, but he said
he'd gotten used to Napster and was hesitant to turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the music industry locally said it was
fruitless to try to stop the downloading of music, pointing to
other sites like gnutella.wego.com and scour.com, which offer
similar services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie was already out of the bottle anyway,'' said Steve
Rullman, 32, who runs a locally based Web site _ thehoneycomb.com _
that lets users to listen to new bands of all types.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, Gnutella's file-sharing was down because of
``unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision,''
according to the Web site. The Napster site was especially
susceptible to a court ruling because the songs are listed on the
site, unlike some other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Area record vendors said the online downloading could actually
help business by exposing listeners to music they otherwise
wouldn't be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study of more than 2,200 online music fans by New
York-based Jupiter Communications suggests that users of
music-sharing programs are 45 percent more likely to increase their
music purchasing than fans who aren't trading digital bootlegs
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps promote the band,'' said a manager at Downtown Books
and CDs in Lake Worth, who goes by the name Kenny 5. ``They like
the song (after hearing it online), they go out and buy the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Pruszynski, 32, who owns Music-X-Change in Jupiter,
said that may be true for the near future only.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to look ahead, say, another five to ten years,'' he
said, ``I would say the smart bet would be to get out of this
business.''
