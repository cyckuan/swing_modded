<HEADLINE> Metallica Files Copyright Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Heavy metal rock band Metallica has accused
three universities and the makers of a popular Internet music
sharing software of copyright infringement and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit contends San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster
Inc., the University of Southern California, Yale University and
Indiana University encouraged users of Napster software to trade
copyrighted material without the band's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take our craft -- whether it be the music, the lyrics, or
the photos and artwork very seriously, as do most artists,''
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said in a statement on the Elektra
Records Web site. ''It is therefore sickening to know that our art
is being traded like a commodity rather than the art that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for
and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica alleges the universities allowed free trade of
copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the
Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based band filed the lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret that the band's management saw fit to issue a press
release -- and to file a lawsuit -- without even attempting to
contact Napster,'' said Eileen Richardson, the company's chief
executive officer. ''But if these people insist on turning it over
to lawyers, we'll defend the case on that turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster also has been sued by the Recording Industry Association
of America in federal court in San Francisco. The trade group,
which represents major recording labels, alleged copyright
infringement by Napster and is seeking $100,000 for each song
traded using Napster software.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Yale and USC were not immediately returned. A spokesman
for Indiana University said lawyers for the university had not seen
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven universities are known to have blocked access to
Napster because its use by students downloading audio files have
slowed their computer networks to a crawl.
