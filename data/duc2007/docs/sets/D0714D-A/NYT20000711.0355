ROCK MUSICIANS WARN SENATORS OF INTERNET PIRACY PERIL

   WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol
Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the
recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica,
found what may have been an unexpected ally in Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, and chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is
what I'm hearing,'' Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into
the hallway of the Hart Senate Building. Hundreds lined up to get a
view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash
between the recording industry and online music outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents
major record labels, and several music groups have argued that
software created by the online music start-up Napster permits
individuals to steal copyrighted material. Officials for the
service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy
sharing and sampling of music.
</P>
<P>
   To use the Napster service, which is free, users download
software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog
their music on their own computers. Napster posts those catalogs,
and then enables users of the service to visit one another's
computers over the Internet and share and download one another's
music.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music
industry is not viable.'' Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to
keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same
options?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for
copyright infringement. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this
spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated
copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private
marketplace. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking minority member
of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the
United States was ``the envy of the world.'' Leahy, who kept an
open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted
that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the
debate on intellectual property and the need for certain
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may
initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property
protection,'' Leahy said. ``In the end, things get sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the
legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo,
Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million
users. And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the
recording industry. People are buying more records, he said,
because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and
which control distribution of creative works, have a strong
inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for
public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new
technologies to emerge. But, he said, innovations like radio,
television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have
``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright
holders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a
``market-based solution that will benefit consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who testified Tuesday agreed. Fred Ehrlich, president of
new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.,
said the ``private market will set itself right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hoffman Jr., president of Emusic.com, which charges and
pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that
the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing
current copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said the
issue was ``a lot of worrying about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention.
``I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out
ourselves,'' he said. ``The differences are too deep on too many
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against
Piracy ran full-page advertisements Tuesday in several major
newspapers. The coalition supports the stance taken by Ulrich and
members of Metallica in favor of protecting intellectual property
rights. Corporate donors to the group include the National
Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry
Association of America and Walt Disney Co.
