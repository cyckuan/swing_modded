	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown
began in May, the party said Friday.
	   If the figure is accurate, it would be the largest number of
arrests of opposition members since the nationwide democracy
uprising in 1988.
	   More than half the arrests have taken place since Sunday, in an
apparent government effort to stymie the National League for
Democracy's announced plans to convene parliament.
	   The NLD said 194 members of parliament are among the arrested
party members. The military rulers never allowed parliament to meet
after the NLD won a landslide victory in elections held in 1990.
	   The government avoids saying it has detained any NLD members. It
claims instead they were ``invited'' to government guest houses for
an exchange of views on convening parliament.
	   On Thursday night it released four photographs purporting to
show ``Invited guests enjoying watching TV'' and other activities.
Most of those photographed looked stiff and unsmiling.
	   The NLD statement, while announcing the new detentions, also
said that nine members of the NLD's organizing committee in the
capital had been released on Wednesday after being briefly
detained.
	   On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups
condemned the arrests and voiced their support for the convening of
parliament.
	   The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front
and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrests were an ``insulting
act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma.''
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and
Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest
crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more
than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
	   The British embassy in Yangon meanwhile denied allegations in
Myanmar's state-run press that NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is a
British citizen, while military-run newspapers on Friday renewed
threats to deport the Nobel laureate.
	   Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal
attacks against 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is
married to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her
attempts to bring democracy to the country.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962.
	   Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of
Myanmar signed ``Supreme Court Justice'' said that Suu Kyi is a
British citizen and so the government should deport her.
	   A 1982 law makes dual citizenship in Myanmar illegal.
