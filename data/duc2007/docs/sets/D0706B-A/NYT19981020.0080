<P>
   Much of our energy at the State Department is spent encouraging
foreign governments to act for what we perceive to be the common
good _ dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting
economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and
technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and
advocating the development of democratic practices and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   We do this to prevent conflicts, build prosperity and strengthen
the forces of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed, we must convince foreign leaders that the common
good is good for them as well and that our own agenda is
aboveboard. Obviously, we do not use the same approach with an
established modern power that we use with a government whose
authority is weak and institutions wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   We consider the domestic pressures that may be affecting a
government along with the proclivities and capacities of its
leaders. And in any relationship, we refer constantly back to our
basic principles and goals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there has been much debate about whether we are
more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments
by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions. The
answer, of course, is that it depends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view
of dissent. Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China
while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Some accuse us of having a double standard. In reality, we have
a single standard based on our assessment of the approach most
likely to achieve results that serve U.S. interests and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   In Burma's case, a repressive military regime has rebuffed
repeated appeals for talks with the democratic opposition led by
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Under the junta, Burma
has become, with official connivance, the world's leading source of
heroin and, with official neglect, the epicenter of a regional AIDS
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its increasingly desperate people are fleeing to
neighboring countries. The democrats, who overwhelmingly won
Burma's last free elections, have called for a halt to foreign
investment and many categories of aid. Political change is
essential if Burma is to transform itself into a source of
stability in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions may well work. Having driven the economy into the
ground, the regime desperately needs foreign investment, loans and
aid. By denying these benefits _ and encouraging others to do the
same _ we may eventually persuade Burmese leaders to rethink where
their own best interests lie.
</P>
<P>
   America's stake in China is far deeper and broader than in
Burma. Asian security, nonproliferation and economic health cannot
be won without Chinese cooperation. Our task is to encourage China
to become a full and fully constructive participant in the
international system. Our approach is to engage in a dialogue with
Chinese leaders while encouraging the broad exchange of information
and ideas between American and Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Burma, China is changing rapidly. The government is
committed to economic reform. On proliferation, China has
progressed from advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to signing
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention while agreeing to
tighten controls on sensitive exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, China has placed a new emphasis on the
rule of law, permitted somewhat more open public discussion of
political reform, released several prominent dissidents and
ratified one international human-rights convention while promising
to sign another this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western
political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur
to further openness and change. Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among
others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way
to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic
and ethnic heritage of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.
That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the
Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do
better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for
more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot
come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly
and compellingly to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone
will cause democracy in China to blossom. China's future will be
determined by the Chinese. But our engagement can contribute to an
environment in which the Chinese people have more access to
information, more contact with the democratic world and less
resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success
of our policy toward China or Burma. In both cases, we hope for
progress; in neither do we expect miracles. Toward these countries
and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and
persistent. And we must design our policies not with a cookie
cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.
</P>
<P>
   All this argues for flexibility. There has long been tension
between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions,
prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on
foreign policy. Having worked in both branches, I know that this
tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from
Congress can help to spur action. What is not helpful is the
growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of
a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the
leverage needed to bargain effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of
our goals. Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic. It requires
persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new
understandings. That may entail simple logic, economic incentives,
technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing,
coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of
sanctions or any combination of the above _ and it may require a
different mix of those elements tomorrow than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   To do his job well, the president must be able to pick and
choose. You would not ask a carpenter to build a house with only a
hammer. We should not expect our chief executive to construct a
successful foreign policy without a full box of tools.
