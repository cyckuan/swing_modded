Britain: Suu Kyi not citizen as Myanmar renews deportation threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The British embassy in Yangon denied
allegations in Myanmar's state-run press that opposition leader
Aung San Suu Kyi is a British citizen, while military-run
newspapers on Friday renewed threats to deport the Nobel laureate.
	   Since Sunday, the military has arrested more than 300 of members
of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to
prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly. Nearly 200
elected lawmakers are among those who have been arrested.
	   Despite promising before the polls to hand over power to the
winners, the military refused to honor the result after its rule
was overwhelmingly rejected by Myanmar citizens.
	   Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal
attacks against the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is married
to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her attempts to
bring democracy to the country.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962.
	   Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of
Myanmar signed ``Supreme Court Justice'' said that Suu Kyi is a
British citizen and so the government should deport her.
	   Suu Kyi is the daughter of Myanmar's late independence hero,
Gen. Aung San. A 1982 law makes dual citizenship in Myanmar
illegal.
	   On Friday, commentaries in the military-controlled press urged
Suu Kyi to go back to Britain before the government takes legal
action and deports her.
	   ``In response to recent media speculation, the British
government would like to make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi is not,
and never has been, a British citizen,'' a statement from the
embassy said on Friday.
	   Earlier this week, the U.S. government issued a statement
condemning the threat to deport Suu Kyi and the arrest of her party
members.
	   The governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Japan have
also condemned the arrests, as have human rights groups Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch Asia.
	   On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups
added their condemnations for the arrests and their support for the
convening of parliament.
	   The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front
and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrest were an ``insulting
act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma.''
	   The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and
Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest
crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more
than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
	   Discontent with the regime is widespread because of its handling
of the economy. Military bungling has turned resource-rich Myanmar
into one of the world's poorest nations.
	   Defense spending accounts for more than half the government
budget, while inflation is running at more than 60 percent, rice is
in short supply, foreign investment has dried up and power
blackouts are a daily occurrence in Yangon.
