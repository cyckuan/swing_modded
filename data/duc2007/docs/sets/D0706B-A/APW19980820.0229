 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Suu Kyi offering to end protest

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered
Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government
if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political
party.
	   Suu Kyi's health was also ``failing'' according to a statement
released Thursday by the National League for Democracy, her
political party.
	   Citing her personal physicians, who have visited her twice in
her van outside Yangon, her eyes are turning yellow and she has low
blood pressure, the party statement said.
	   Her doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted
jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in her car
with three colleagues 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months
with the military government over her right to travel freely within
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   She was stopped outside Yangon last Wednesday by the authorities
as she attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet with
members of parliament from her party.
	   The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to
return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of
parliament and other members of her party imprisoned since May.
	   There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons,
according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile
group.
	   The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear, as Suu
Kyi has said in the past that when people are arrested in far flung
provinces the party sometimes doesn't hear about it.
	   There was no immediate response from the military government to
Suu Kyi's demand. In the past, they have never met her calls to
release political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
	   Suu Kyi's offer to end her protest comes one day before her
party's deadline for the military to convene parliament.
	   The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the
demand.
	   ``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists
no constitution,'' said a government spokesman, on condition of
anonymity. ``The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald
person to dye his hair.''
	   Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and
Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to
be convened.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990
election, but the military refused to honor the results. After the
NLD victory, it denied the election was for a parliament, but
instead for delegates to a convention to write a new constitution.
	   The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on
gives the military the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi
from holding public office.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
In 1988, the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a
nationwide democracy uprising.
