   When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Thailand
for this week's ministerial meeting of ASEAN, the Association of
South East Asian Nations, she will demonstrate American support for
a regional grouping that can boast of many successes and one
flagrant failure _ the military dictatorship ruining Burma. It is
becoming harder and harder for ASEAN members to ignore the
depredations of the Burmese junta.
</P>
<P>
   No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's
crimes than host Thailand. For much of the past decade, the Thais
have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military
officers. At the recent AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa,
the US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, rightly
praised the Thai government for its success in implementing
policies to reduce the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the uniformed thugs who rule Burma are undermining those
hard-won triumphs. Whereas Bangkok has achieved exemplary progress
in substituting legal cash crops for the poppies used to make
heroin, Burma under the junta continues to be a principal source
for the heroin that destroys lives from Bangkok to Boston. And
where there is heroin addiction there is an inevitable increase in
the rate of HIV infections and cases of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a new evil has come cascading into Thailand from
Burma: millions of easily smuggled tablets of the stimulant
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Although noninterference in the internal affairs of member
states is a founding principle of ASEAN, the cross-border flow of
narcotics, HIV, and refugees into Thailand demonstrates the folly
of pretending that Burma's ASEAN neighbors are not affected by the
junta's misrule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of good governance is at the root of our country's
troubles,'' the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Aung San Suu
Kyi, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article. ASEAN members ought
to heed her temperate yet resolute counsel. They should pressure
Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi,
Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for
Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately
denied its right to govern by the military.
