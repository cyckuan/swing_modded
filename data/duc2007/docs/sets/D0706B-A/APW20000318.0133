<HEADLINE> Myanmar Democracy Leader Awarded  </HEADLINE>

   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi was awarded the Freedom of the City honor Saturday night in
recognition of her activism in her Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her peaceful
struggle for democracy against the military regime in Myanmar, also
known as Burma. The military regime overturned her party's
resounding victory in general elections the previous year, and
refused to recognize the vote as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of members of her National League for Democracy have
since been jailed. Suu Kyi herself was under house arrest for six
years before being released in 1995. Her movements and political
activities remain heavily restricted.
</P>
<P>
   She did not attend the Dublin ceremony, but her son Kim Aris
flew to Ireland to collect the award in her place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aung San Suu Kyi was chosen for this award because of her long
courageous stand in support of democracy in Burma,'' said Dublin's
Lord Mayor Mary Freehill. ''We will leave the roll of honor
unsigned like we did for (South African President) Nelson Mandela,
until she is free to travel to Dublin herself to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Irish pop band U2 were also given the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard this as a very big deal for us, and we are very
humbled by it. It's humbling and it's fantastic,'' lead singer Bono
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freehill, a longtime admirer of the band, said: ''In a lot of
ways they put Dublin on the map when the city was not as popular as
it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other figures who have received the Freedom of the City honor
include U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, Pope John
Paul II and Mother Teresa.
