General accuses Suu Kyi of working with terrorists

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ While Myanmar's military government
continued its arrests of the country's democracy activists, a top
general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of
working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Gen. Tin Oo, one of the top four generals in the 21-member
ruling military council, said Suu Kyi was working ``in
collaboration with underground terrorists and some super power
countries,'' the New Light of Myanmar reported.
	   Their goal, he said, was to cause instability and the
disintegration of the nation.
	   Tin Oo is army chief of staff and a leader of what is considered
the hard-line faction in the State Peace and Development Council,
the official name of the junta.
	   Suu Kyi and her party follow a doctrine of political change
through nonviolence. She has cited U.S. civil rights leader Martin
Luther King and Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi as her influences.
	   The military has arrested more than 500 members of Suu Kyi's
political party, the National League for Democracy, since May,
party leaders said Wednesday.
	   More than 300 of the arrests have taken place since Sunday. The
military began rounding up NLD members this week to prevent the
party from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD said 129 members of parliament were arrested in the
latest sweep. A total of 187 have been arrested since May.
	   In addition, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles
group, said the junta had arrested more than 300 students since
June for campaigning for democracy.
	   ``The ABSDF estimates that more than 900 political arrests have
taken place since May, including MPs from all opposition parties,
opposition party officials, students, Buddhist monks and other
political activists,'' the group said.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other
nations, along with human rights group such as Amnesty
International, have condemned the arrests and called on the
military to begin a dialogue with the NLD.
	   On Thursday, the Burma Lawyers Council, composed of exiles,
called on the country's lawyers to endorse the convening of
parliament.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the parliament, but
despite promising to hand over power to the winners before the poll
took place, the military refused to honor the result.
	   The party set Aug. 21 as a deadline for the military to call the
assembly into session. When the generals refused, the NLD said it
would convene parliament, known as the People's Assembly, on its
own.
	   The military warned the NLD that such a move would be illegal
and could result in the party being outlawed. It claims it has
arrested no one, but merely ``invited'' NLD members to military
guest houses for an ``exchange of views.''
	   Suu Kyi, whose movements are severely restricted by the
government, has not been seen in pubic since the crackdown began.
