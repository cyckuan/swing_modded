<HEADLINE> Myanmar Asks Thailand to Control Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Tuesday demanded that the
Thai government strictly control refugee camps on the Thai side of
 the two countries' border.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made by Colonel Thein Swe, head of the
Department of Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense
Ministry at a press conference here Tuesday afternoon following
the peaceful end of the siege of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by
Myanmar armed men last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said there are 24 refugee camps along the Myanmar-Thai
border where members and their families of different anti-Myanmar
government armed groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front (ABSDF), Kayin National Union (KNU) and Democratic Alliance
of Burma (DAB) are living and conducting military and "terrorist"
training there involving foreigners.

<P>
Regarding the seizure of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and the
taking of hostages by Myanmar armed men, he stressed that the
receiving country should take up the responsibility for the
security of an embassy stationed there.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that five armed men -- three from the ABSDF, one
from the KNU and the remaining one from the God's Children Army
-- were involved in the incident last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the armed men demanded that the Myanmar
government release all political prisoners, recognize the results
of the 1990 general election and reshuffle the government.
</P>
<P>
After a 25-hour tense standoff, the five Myanmar armed men
Saturday ended their siege of the Myanmar Embassy and freed all
the 38 hostages before they were flown to the Myanmar border in
Ratchaburi in the company of Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra.
