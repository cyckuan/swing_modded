   WASHINGTON _ The Thai government has yet to ask the United
States to accept 1,500 new Burmese student refugees, but a State
Department official said Thursday that the United States ``would be
willing to consider taking more refugees if there is a need.''

   The United States has agreed to resettle 600 of these student
refugees from Thailand this year, twice the number who were
resettled here last year. The students fled Burma after the
military coup in 1988 and have been refugees in Thailand for more
than a decade. The official said the refugees had no connection to
the Burmese guerrilla group that stormed a Thai hospital this week.
