   NEW YORK _ ``Waiting,'' by Ha Jin, a novel set in contemporary
China, about a man struggling with the conflicting claims of two
women, won the National Book Award for fiction Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for nonfiction was ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the
Wake of World War II'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Company/The New Press) by
John W. Dower, about the transformation of Japan into a democracy
under American occupation. The poetry prize went to the dramatic
monologues about urban life in ``Vice: New and Selected Poems''
(W.W. Norton &AMP; Company) by Ai.

   ``When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,'' (Henry Holt and Company)
by Kimberly Willis Holt, a coming-of-age story about a 13-year-old
boy who is obese, won the award for young people's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Jin, the author of ``Waiting,'' which is published by
Pantheon Books, served for six years in the People's Liberation
Army of his native China, and came to the United States in 1985. He
is a professor of English at Emory University.

   The ceremony, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
National Book Foundation, the sponsor of the awards, was held at
the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan. The talk show host Oprah
Winfrey, a powerful figure in the book world because of Oprah's
Book Club, received a 50th Anniversary Medal from the foundation.

<P>
   ``More than movie stars and rock stars and famous politicians
and world leaders,'' she said, ``I love authors. I love authors
because in the beginning was the word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of you here who are liberated by the word,'' she said,
``God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey founded her book blub in 1996, and since then being
chosen for the club has been almost a guarantee that a book will be
a best seller. Ms. Winfrey remembered calling up Wally Lamb, author
of ``She's Come Undone,'' whose novel was one of her selections,
and he was doing his laundry.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revelation, Ms. Winfrey said. ``Authors do laundry!''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Steve Martin, who served as master of ceremonies at
the dinner, said that at first when he was asked to be the host of
the event, he thought it was for the National Basketball
Association. But, Martin said, ``I really wanted to come here
tonight because I thought it would be a good way to troll for
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please keep your acceptance speeches short, especially if you
don't win,'' Martin told the audience of more than 1,000 people,
including 35 past winners, and 17 writers who attended the first
National Book Award ceremony in 1950 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Notably missing from this year's nominations were two of the
industry's biggest books this year. ``Dutch,'' a semi-fictional
biography of Ronald Reagan by Edmund Morris, and ``'Tis,'' the
sequel to Frank McCourt's best selling memoir, ``Angela's Ashes''
both failed to get nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mergers in the publishing industry, the Foundation said
it received nominations from a record number of imprints. Eight
hundred and eighty one titles were submitted, somewhat fewer than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in each category receive a $10,000 cash award and
crystal sculpture.
