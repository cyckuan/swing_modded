 &HT;    Net site offers preview of Grisham's `Brethren'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant

   John Grisham fans who can't wait until his new legal thriller,
``The Brethren'' (Doubleday, $27.95), is published Feb. 1 can get a
sneak preview of the first two chapters online courtesy of the
publisher and Liquid Audio. But there's a catch: You can only
listen to the first chapter via a Liquid Audio player, which can be
downloaded free. Then you can read the second chapter and order
copies of the book online.

   Liquid Audio Inc. is a major provider of software and services
for the digital delivery of music over the Internet. This is the
first time Doubleday, part of the Random House publishing empire,
has released a preview using a digital download in conjunction with
a print excerpt. This is just another marketing tool, says Terrence
Chenge, Web producer for Random House. ``The extensive distribution
network of Liquid Audio gives us an additional channel for
promoting and selling our books, both online and through
traditional markets.''

   ``The Brethren'' is about three former judges who are perfecting
a mail-order scam while serving time in a Florida federal prison.
They all are getting rich until something goes terribly wrong on
the outside.

   &QR;  Winfrey winner: North Carolina novelist Robert Morgan is the
latest author to join Oprah Winfrey's exclusive circle. The TV talk
show host has chosen Morgan's novel ``Gap Creek'' (Algonquin Books,
$22.95) for her next book club discussion. Set in
turn-of-the-century Appalachia, ``Gap Creek'' is the story of
17-year-old Judy Harmon, who has to deal with premature births and
deaths, malnutrition, poverty and other hardships. Morgan, a
55-year-old poet who turned to fiction in 1984, is also the author
of ``The Truest Pleasure'' and ``The Hinterlands.''

   &QR;  Irish eyes: It's been years since Edna O'Brien left Ireland
for London, but her homeland still has an irresistible attraction.
After writing a biography of James Joyce last year, O'Brien returns
to fiction and the Irish landscape in April with ``Wild Decembers''
(Houghton Mifflin, $24). The novel traces the story of a sister,
her brother and a love-hate relationship with a neighboring
landowner. O'Brien will give a preview of the work during a free
reading at 7 tonight at Emory University, followed by a reception
and book signing.
