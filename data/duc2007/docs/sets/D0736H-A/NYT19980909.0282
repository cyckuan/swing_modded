 &HT;    New season Of ``Oprah'' seems a little different from last
season
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now there's violence on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not the gutter brawls like you see on ratings competitor
``Jerry Springer.'' Not the hair pulling. Not the pimp slapping.
Not the chair throwing.
</P>
<P>
   But violence it is.
</P>
<P>
   There's Winfrey on Wednesday with her new ``change your life''
guru John Gray (``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus''), who
hands a big wooden stick to an audience member named Debbie. She's
feeling real guilty because no matter how hard she tries, she can't
make everyone she knows happy.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie's then instructed to whack a red box with the word
``Guilt'' written on it. And whack it Debbie does with her best
Mark McGwire swing. Bam!
</P>
<P>
   This week Winfrey has launched a new season of her daily talk
show. And, somehow, talk just doesn't seem to fit this show any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a daily chakra show.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has reinvented herself, her show, her mission, her set,
her theme song (she sings it herself). On Tuesday she meditated,
was shown lounging serenely in a bathtub surrounded by lighted
candles and talking about ``Remembering Your Spirit.'' On Wednesday
she sported a quite fashionable long tan skirt. She looks great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah'' is now all about learning who you are with a capital
``YOU.'' She's calling it ``Change Your Life TV'' and part of that
will include a free, over-the-tube seminar each Wednesday with
Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determine for yourself your soul's true desire.'' ``Everyone's
pain is the same.'' ``Personal success is not deemed by
possessions.'' ``The secret of success is intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Winfrey's shown sitting by a pond, dabbing her bare feet
in the water and chronicling in her daily journal the things she's
grateful for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at each little blossom,'' she writes. ``I'm
grateful to return to the farm and all of its green glory.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can't help but wonder what's going on over on
``Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Dumping You!'' is Jerry's mantra for this day. A mom comes
on stage, reaches over and slaps a guy named Jason a good one. Mom
wants him out of her daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a big fat liar, Jason,'' she screams. ``You ain't gonna
do nothin' ... you need to get out of her life and leave her
alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Over on ``Oprah,'' Winfrey says, ``What I believe is that we are
all looking for something deeper, greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip to ``Springer'': Three female audience members say their
goodbyes to the camera. Then turn around quickly and bend over ``to
show our bootys for you, Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather and Larry King on the same team?
</P>
<P>
   CNN and CBS News are holding preliminary talks about a possible
merger, but don't look for anything to come of it. The two have
held similar talks several times over the past few years and
nothing has happened yet, or really ever come close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rumors of talks are true, and they come as CBS News
is faced with cutting a reported $40 million out of its budget.
There's speculation inside CBS that it's CBS executives who are
leaking word of the talks, and that their goal is convincing Wall
Street analysts the network is serious about reducing costs, which
would have a positive impact on CBS's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, merger talks have broken down because neither side
would yield control over a merged operation to the other. There's
little apparent reason at this point to think that's changed.
</P>
