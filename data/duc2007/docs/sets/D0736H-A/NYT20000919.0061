   CAMPAIGN-ROUNDUP (Undated) _ George W. Bush courts women voters
by appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show as Al Gore did last week.
Gore presses his populist challenge in North Hills, Calif.,
demanding that the health insurance industry safeguard the privacy
of patients' medical records. Bush aides question Gore's
credibility, urging the vice president to explain his claim in
Florida that the pharmaceutical industry has forced his
mother-in-law to pay nearly three times as much for arthritis
medicine as the amount Gore pays for a similar drug used by his
ailing dog. By STEWART M. POWELL.

   CENSUS (Washington) _ About seven in 10 households completed and
returned Census forms by mail or on the Internet, reversing a
three-decade decline in Census response rates, federal officials
announce. The 67 percent response rate comes despite rising
distrust of government and strong attacks on the Census Bureau's
methodology, says Robert Shapiro, an under secretary of commerce.

   CAMPAIGN FINANCE (Washington) _ Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura
joins Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., in
lobbying for campaign finance reform during an election in which
unregulated contributions to the Republican and Democratic parties
have skyrocketed. The McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, which
would ban the unregulated funds, called soft money, stalled in
Congress earlier this year. Advocates say they are focusing on the
next Congress. By JENNIFER A. DLOOUHY.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington)_ Federal law forbids the construction
of any memorial in the nation's capital until the person to be
honored has been dead for a quarter century. This is a good rule.
The city is awash in monuments. Conservatives pushing for a statue
of former President Ronald Reagan are premature. Nostalgia for a
politician who left us with the biggest deficits in history has not
yet set in _ and may never do so. By MARIANNE MEANS.
