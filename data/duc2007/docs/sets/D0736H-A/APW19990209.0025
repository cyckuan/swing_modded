<HEADLINE> Oprah Winfrey May End Her TV Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime  
television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready 
to bail out of her long-running show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am all talked out,'' Winfrey told The Sunday Times. ``My  
contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows 
because I feel they are going to burn themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah  
Winfrey Show'' in September 1986. Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it 
recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told  
the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her 
stint on the movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more  
dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling  
his show a ``vulgarity circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just  
hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have 
sexual intercourse -- and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy 
pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes 
a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted 
as telling the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping  
her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a 
publicist in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued  
Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey 
would continue the show after the end of her current contract.
