   NEW YORK (AP) -- It may not be all Oprah, all the time, but Oprah
Winfrey's new magazine, O, comes pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who will grace the cover of every issue for the
''foreseeable future''? And there's plenty more of Oprah inside,
too. Essays from the magazine's creator and lead personality,
titled ''Let's Talk'' and ''What I Know for Sure,'' are at the very
beginning and very end of each issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ''Oprah to Go,'' cutout cards with inspiring
quotations chosen by the talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which is a partnership with Hearst Corp., goes on
sale Wednesday. Fans need not worry that it will dominate Winfrey's
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, the Oprah show is still the mother lode,'' Winfrey
said.
