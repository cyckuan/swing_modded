THAT WAS THE SWEEPS MONTH THAT WAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle

<P>
   The February sweeps end Wednesday night, so it's time for a very
special, all-daytime and early evening remembrance of the month
that was ...
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Extra'' hired a forensics expert, Dr. Laurence Kobilinski
of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, to
determine that women's panties on department-store shelves are
often soiled.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Ivana Trump, leading ``Access Hollywood'' viewers on a tour
of her six-floor townhouse in New York, said the ``Leopard Room''
was her favorite. She explained, ``I just feel really good between
the prints _ zebra, cheetah or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Inside Edition'' investigated the story of a man who
injected his 7-year-old son with HIV. The judge who sentenced the
father said he would ``burn in hell for an eternity.'' But the
boy's mother told the TV show, ``My only fear _ what if he likes
hell?''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Oprah Winfrey took her show to the Bahamas for a week. The
lineup included a ``Sexiest Island Man'' contest and ``fabulous
bathing suit makeovers'' for vacationing sunbathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Roseanne visited Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.
Talk-show host Jon Stewart came along, Roseanne's publicists said,
``to live out his teenage fantasy of wearing a smoking jacket,
drinking martinis from a crystal glass and, of course, Bunnies,
Bunnies, Bunnies!''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers was the guest
on still another incredible ``Roseanne Show'' installment.
Roseanne: ``Powerful guys like to be spanked and stuff. Now with
you, did he ever have that?'' Flowers: ``With me, he had it all!''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``There is nothing suspect in my mind, or I wouldn't be
dating him,'' 23-year-old Christie Prody told ``Inside Edition'' of
her relationship with O.J. Simpson. Prody bears an eerie physical
resemblance to the late Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Big month for Maury Povich. The Fox special with a
5,000-year-old sealed tomb in Egypt, plus ``My Sexy Mom Embarrasses
Me,'' ``Men Are Glamorous Women Too,'' ``I Need to Know Who My
Daddy Is'' and ``I Work Like a Man, Make Me Look Like a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Jenny Jones got into the ring with professional wrestler
Bone Breakin' Jones. Bone Breakin' reportedly survived the
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Continuing her own hyperactive month, Roseanne served for a
week as guest editor of the National Enquirer, the supermarket
tabloid she once sued. Roseanne approved stories about a professor
who spent $720,000 to stop teapots from dribbling, a state lottery
winner whose weight ballooned to 735 pounds and a traffic court
judge who is blind.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Just another day for Jerry Springer. On his ``Sizzling Sex
Secrets'' installment, Mike confessed to his girlfriend C.C. that
he'd cheated on her with a woman named Champagne. But Mike was
surprised and quite possibly chagrined to learn on the show that
Champagne is a he, not a she. A brawl may have ensued.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; A ``Real TV'' investigation turned up 1980 footage of
Springer crooning ``Me and Bobby McGee.'' Springer, a former
Cincinnati TV news anchor, told ``Real TV'' that it ``must have
been in my news days.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Unbelievable month for Roseanne. On yet another of her
shows, psychic and medium James Van Praagh relayed a message from
Nicole Brown Simpson to Nicole's sister Denise. The message about
the importance of forgiveness assured Nicole's survivors that
wherever she is, she's got her head screwed on straight.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; On ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' the program's
self-professed No. 1 fan, Anya Gerrato, correctly answered eight
out of 10 tough trivia questions about Rosie and the show. She
missed the Chub Club's motto, but she did know which rock star
tried to French-kiss Rosie.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out the tongue sandwich was all Meat Loaf.
