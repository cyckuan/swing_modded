<P>
   Oprah Winfrey has played a big part in the emergence of our
tell-all culture, not with a lurid approach, but with a
truth-will-set-you-free attitude. From revelations of her own
sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward
emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey
Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film
about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an
institution and form a tentative, healing friendship. This new
version literally brings mental illness into the light.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so
extreme that it looked gothic. And though the film was a
sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic
music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional
horrors, like ``The Snake Pit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the
California sun. The institution where the teen-agers live is filled
with windows that let crystal light shine through. It shines
especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who
is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull
film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one. Such
a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the
story of its daring. Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its
simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was
always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this film's approach comes in Ms. Winfrey's
introduction. ``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears
and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce
this story.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place
where he can begin to feel and trust again.'' Like an extension of
the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled
intimacy issues. ``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror
when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally
brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage. His fear of
being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition,
but it was there in the original, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair,
buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face. David is so obsessed
with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings
of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
</P>
<P>
   If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets
everything out. She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes. ``Nag,
nag, dirty hag,'' she taunts her social worker, Maggie (Debi
Mazar). She is a shy, pretty girl, with a childlike innocence and
blooming sexuality that the film hints at.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly,
yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which
the entire story depends. Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither
mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier is used for his iconic presence here. He can exude
authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and
often that's what he's called on to do. At other times he is
saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you
don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place
in the study of psychology in the last three decades. In one of the
rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa
is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have
been diagnosed as schizophrenic. (In 1962, schizophrenia was
precisely the proud diagnosis David offered.)
</P>
<P>
   Poitier's character says he prefers simple language. ``People
have feelings,'' he tells David, who has just said he prefers
clocks to humans.
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing as ``David and Lisa'' is, it would be too bad
if it became ammunition in the growing Oprah backlash. The two
previous television films she produced, ``Before Women Had Wings''
and ``The Wedding,'' were among the most intelligent and finely
wrought network films of the past two years. Producing and starring
in ``Beloved'' was a serious artistic move and Oprah's Book Club is
an inspired idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Lisa'' comes from the Oprah Winfrey who joins with
her audience in group therapy, which is not one of her better
roles.
