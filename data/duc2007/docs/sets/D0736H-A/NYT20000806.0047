OPRAH GOES TO PRESS WITH IDEAS ON LIVING WELL
</HEADLINE>

   ``Gore should ask Oprah to be his vice presidential nominee,'' I
heard an amateur pundit _ one of legions, I'm sure _ declare last
week. Think of what follows as theatrical speculation then, set
against a backdrop of some of the dreariest political performances
we've yet been subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush got a father figure in Dick Cheney, one who
supplies him with authority and stability but who still has to take
a back seat when it comes to visibility and sex appeal. Vice
President Al Gore would get a sister with a touch of the mother in
Oprah Winfrey; she would give him an aura of spontaneity,
generosity and basically sexless titillation. I refer, of course,
to the race angle: Theirs would be a chaste union undertaken solely
for the public good. Tipper Gore's position wouldn't be usurped:
The children are there as visible proof of who the real wife is,
and Oprah's companion, Steadman Graham, would be by Oprah's side,
as proof that everyone goes back to the old neighborhood when day
is done.
</P>
<P>
   And there is great mileage to be gotten from a Tipper-Oprah
alliance (the Tipper-Hillary combination had no chemistry). See
them together: just girlfriends one moment, women of authority the
next, jogging, making speeches, photographed shopping together.
Under Oprah's influence Tipper would show a touch of girlish
soulfulness, while Oprah could add chipper gentility to her
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's influence should not be minimized either. He would
appeal greatly to all those unmarried couples who become
inadmissible evidence whenever politicians start testifying about
family values. And he could set an example for men across the
country who may one day find themselves, if they haven't already,
less famous, less wealthy and less powerful than their wives or
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   An aside here. I wish I fully understood why certain
African-Americans, apart from athletes, take on a cultural value
that is nearly godlike but doesn't transcend race. Maybe it's like
what architects or designers do when they take old materials and
arrange them differently: keep the comforting associations of the
past, while getting the excitement of the present and future.
(``These people are black; I know what that has meant and could
still mean, but I feel completely different!'')
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey and Colin Powell have this value. So do certain
actors who have become the voices and bodies of American industry
and technology. There is James Earl Jones as the body and cellular
soul of Verizon Telephone and Ruby Dee as the voice of life
insurance. (It's a nurturing concept, life insurance; it needs a
woman's voice.) And there is Avery Brooks. He first rose to
television fame as the black hustler helpmate of a white private
eye on ``Spenser: For Hire.'' He now commands a space station on
``Deep Space 9'' and embodies the technological prowess of IBM here
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has achieved Oprah's well-nigh superhuman status. (I
use her first name only because the show and the magazine invite me
to.) Look at the cover of her new monthly magazine, still on
newsstands. Read ``O'' in white boldface with ``The Oprah
Magazine'' just below in a bright square of color, then let your
eye move to a full-page photograph of the woman herself. This is
not a magazine title along the lines of Jane or the now-defunct
Mirabella. This is not a proper noun; it is an idea or way of life,
like Vogue; even a species, along the lines of People. And with its
emphasis on physical, psychological and spiritual evolution, there
is the hint that a new species or at least a new, improved gender
is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Both in her magazine and on her television show, Oprah's name is
used in a queenly manner. Implicitly, her ``I'' is a royal ``we'':
she speaks for us as well as to us. (Don't you wish that Diana,
Princess of Wales, had been a guest on her show? That would have
been one for the ages.) But the process works in reverse, too. We
can be _ in fact we are every day _ royalty, striving for the same
kinds of material and spiritual blessings Oprah strives for and, in
the case of material blessings, clearly has won. What's hers is
ours, it seems: the magazine's sensible psychologist, Dr. Phillip
C. McGraw, and its spiritual advice giver, Gary Zukav, both appear
on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah's personal counselors.
Her cook appears too, as do members of her book club.
</P>
<P>
   What a brilliant businesswoman and media star: mogul plus . . .
well, in the early days I would have said updated matriarch, but
she has rechanneled the matriarchal associations that almost
inevitably trail a black woman who can talk at all soulfully and is
not Naomi Campbell thin. Now she is a national care giver, a
national therapist (how smart she was to play Ellen DeGeneres'
therapist on the episode in which she came out) and a
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``fabulously wealthy'' John Beresford Tipton on
that old television show ``The Millionaire,'' who anonymously
bestowed fortunes on ordinary citizens to see if they could use the
money wisely and become better people? Oprah is a real-life
extension of this fantasy, bestowing gifts on her television
audiences _ food, CDs, Palm Pilots _ and opportunities for
self-enhancement and self-discipline on all her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Your Best Life!'' is O's motto. The magazine teaches
informed selflessness and enlightened selfishness. And it does so
very well, adapting and expanding on elements of women's, general
interest and celebrity magazines. Learn to control your temper;
learn to give yourself flowers and candles; learn about community
organizers and how to become one yourself; learn how famous women
cured themselves of ``the disease to please''; take the pull-outs
of quotes from famous people (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
Epictetus, Joe E. Lewis) and tape them to your mirror or mail them
to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue is laid out like a four-step program. The
articles in ``First Words'' are about improving one's life in the
world, from handling money to learning from failure. Then comes
``Live Your Best Life'' with an inward focus: how to meditate, how
to give yourself solitude. Now you are ready for pleasure: ``Enjoy
Yourself'' with fashion, health and beauty ideas. And lastly come
``Features,'' which include Oprah's interview with a famous woman
(Jane Fonda here), profiles, pieces on sex and on aging, and, from
other famous women (Hillary Clinton this time), books that have
made a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine ends with a brief coda called ``. . . and More''
which beautifully recapitulates the themes of Oprah's ministry and
marketing genius. There is a full page of beauty products meant to
``go with'' the articles you have just read on fashion, food and
the home. And there is Oprah's last word, a spiritual anecdote
called ``What I Know for Sure,'' with one last photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Oprah Winfrey need to be a politician? She is already
a business impresario and a media empress.
