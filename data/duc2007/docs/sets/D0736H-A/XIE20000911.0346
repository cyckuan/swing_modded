<HEADLINE> Gore Attracts Women's Votes on TV Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore appeared on a TV talk show Monday
in a bid to attract more women's votes in the November election.
</P>
<P>
"I know something about the job of president," Gore answered
when he was asked by the talk show host why she should vote for
him.
</P>
<P>
Gore is the first politician invited to the television stage of
Oprah Winfrey in Chicago. Gore's Republican rival George W. Bush
is scheduled to appear on September 19 on Winfrey's show, which
reaches 22 million viewers weekly.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a new Federal Trade Commission report criticizing
Hollywood for targeting children with violent products, Gore said
they would ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary "cease-
fire" in marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to
children.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that if elected, his administration would give
entertainment companies six months to clean up their act or face
unspecified "tougher measures" under current laws on advertising.
</P>
<P>
"What we are calling for in this case is industry self-
restraint and self-regulation, not censorship," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the entertainment industry does not change its
practice in the six months, it could be found guilty of false
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in
which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify
gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and
pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that Gore has opened up an 18-point lead
among women, while Bush held about a 20-point lead among men.
