<HEADLINE> Hepatitis C Becomes Major Worldwide Health Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Hepatitis C is now being
recognized as a major public health problem worldwide, an American
expert said today in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
In most developed countries, 1e to 2 percent of the population
is infected with the virus, wrote Dr Adrian Di Bisceglie of Saint
Louis University School of Medicine, in Missouri, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Infection rates are higher in some parts of eastern Europe and
in Africa, and "Egypt seems to have one of the highest prevalence
rates of all, approaching 15 percent of the general population."
he said.
</P>
<P>
Liver disease caused by hepatitis C is now the major reason for
liver transplantation in adults in most countries.
</P>
<P>
In the United States alone, hepatitis C now causes 8,000 to
10,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, deaths are expected to more than triple over the
next two decades, eventually becoming responsible for greater
mortality than AIDS." he added.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis C is predominantly a blood borne disease. Eighty-five
percent of people infected with the virus in most cases will
develop a chronic hepatitis and of these as many as 20 percent
eventually develop cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced
symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were
treated for six months.
</P>
<P>
In some cases the virus disappears from the blood and the
inflammation of the liver is reduced.
</P>
<P>
Some studies also indicate that longer therapy lasting a year
to 18 months may achieve a sustained response in as many as 30
percent of treated patients.
