	LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC today released new data  
indicating its drug Zeffix may help prevent chronic hepatitis B 
sufferers from developing cirrhosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The data from three large clinical studies showed a smaller  
proportion of chronic hepatitis B patients treated with Zeffix 
progressed to cirrhosis, or liver scarring, compared with those 
treated with placebo or interferon-alpha. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were presented at the annual meeting of the European  
Association for the Study of the Liver in Naples, and supported by 
other data showing additional Zeffix benefits, Glaxo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1.8 percent of Zeffix-treated patients progressed to  
cirrhosis, compared with 7.1 percent placebo-treated patients and 
9.5 percent of those treated with interferon-alpha. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo said the results showed a continued increase in the  
incidence of e-antigen seroconversion -- an immune response to the 
virus that is thought to predict long-lasting remission of the 
disease -- and a continued reduction in levels of viral replication. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeffix is available in the Philippines, Canada and the U.S. and  
approved in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan and New Zealand. 
Regulatory applications have been made in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis B is a potentially fatal liver disease -- the  
ninth-most common killer worldwide. About 350 million people are 
long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus and nearly one-third 
are expected to develop progressive inflammation of the liver, 
leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to  
interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side 
effects.
