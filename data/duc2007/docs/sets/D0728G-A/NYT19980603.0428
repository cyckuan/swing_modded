NEW TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC HEPATITIS C IS APPROVED

<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a
powerful combination of two antiviral drugs to treat chronic
hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver
cancer and liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans are estimated to have chronic hepatitis
C, and 10,000 die from it each year. The disease is the leading
reason for liver transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   The newly approved treatment, known as Rebetron, works far
better than sole standard treatment. But it is expensive, it poses
serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who
take it. Although it can eradicate signs of infection, it cannot be
called a cure. And doctors say that not everyone with hepatitis C
needs it.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment consists of a six-month course of interferon
injections and ribavirin capsules. The full course of therapy will
cost $6,400 to $8,600, depending on how high a dose a patient
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rebetron, which is made by Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison,
N.J., has been approved for use only in people who relapse after
the standard treatment for hepatitis C, which is a course of
interferon injections. That therapy eliminates the disease in only
10 percent to 20 percent of patients. About half do not respond to
interferon at all. The remaining 30 percent to 40 percent respond
to interferon and then relapse, and those are the patients for whom
Rebetron has been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Tested in such a group, Rebetron reduced the virus to
undetectable levels in 45 percent, an effect that persisted when
the patients were tested again six months after treatment ended. In
patients given interferon alone, only 5 percent had undetectable
levels.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research
at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, who was not involved in the study, said those results
meant there was a good chance that the effects would last. In
studies of patients who responded to interferon alone, he said,
those who were free of the virus at six months remained so at six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure we won't find people with recurring disease
as we go further out,'' Seeff said. ``We need a much longer time to
follow all these people. The proof will come 20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rebetron has been approved only for patients who
have relapsed after trying interferon, doctors will be free to
prescribe it as they see fit. Seeff and Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director
of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national
institute said they expected that many doctors would prescribe it
for all hepatitis C patients, including those who have not taken
interferon or who did not respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoofnagle said data had been presented at medical meetings
showing that when the combination was given for one year to people
who had never been treated before, the relapse rate was only 20
percent. Given the poor response rate with interferon alone, he
said, it seems reasonable to go straight to the combination.
</P>
<P>
   But the drugs can have serious side effects. While interferon
alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause
severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people
with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or
stroke. It can also cause birth defects, so women must avoid
pregnancy while they take it and for six months after. Psychiatric
problems have also been reported. In addition, the interferon
component of the treatment causes flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate,
Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients
truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with
hepatitis C. Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic
infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer. It is
impossible to predict just which ones will become severely ill, but
medical authorities now recommend treatment only for patients who
have detectable viral levels and abnormal results on tests of liver
enzymes. Others can be monitored and treated later if the disease
seems to be progressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's mild, I say let's follow it carefully and wait it out
until we have a little bit better therapy,'' Hoofnagle said. ``Some
people don't want to be treated at all, but others are so anxious
that they don't care what you tell them and they just want to be
treated.''
