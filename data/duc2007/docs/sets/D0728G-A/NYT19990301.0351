<P>
   Serono Laboratories Inc. suffered a major blow Monday by failing
to obtain permission from the federal government to sell its
multiple sclerosis drug in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the US Food and Drug Administration marks a
major victory for Biogen Inc., Serono's main competitor in the
$500 &UR;  &LR; million-a-year market for multiple sclerosis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., and Serono, of Norwell, Mass.,
manufacture beta interferon, a drug used to slow down the
debilitating neurological disease. Biogen's drug is called Avonex
and has been on the US market since 1996, while Serono makes Rebif.
Avonex and Rebif are chemically identical.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling delivered to Serono on Friday and disclosed
Monday, the FDA said Biogen maintains the exclusive right to sell
beta interferon in the United States until 2003 under the Orphan
Drug Act, a law that grants marketing exclusivity to companies that
develop drugs for certain, rare diseases, including multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As today's FDA ruling makes clear, Rebif does not offer
greater efficacy or safety and does not provide a significant
addition to patient care,'' said Jim Vincent, Biogen's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, however, technically leaves the door open for
Serono to obtain a waiver from the Orphan Drug Act by demonstrating
that Rebif is clinically superior to Avonex. So far, Serono has
spent more than $100 million to develop the drug, which is only
available in Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Serono has tried to argue, so far to no avail, that Rebif is
different from Avonex in three ways. While Avonex must be mixed
with a sterile solution before it is injected into the muscle,
Rebif comes pre-mixed in syringes for injections beneath the skin.
More importantly, Serono said Rebif comes in several doses, while
Avonex is only approved for one dose. Serono executives have argued
that stronger doses of beta interferon work better for patients
with more advanced multiple sclerosis. Its research, however, did
not include head-to-head trials comparing Avonex and Rebif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serono will continue its discussions with the FDA on the
outstanding orphan drug issues to determine how it can make Rebif
available to MS patients as soon as possible,'' said Hisham Samra,
Serono Laboratories' president.
</P>
<P>
   Serono is a subsidiary of the Geneva-based Ares-Serono Group,
the world's largest fertility drug maker.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen's stock soared 6 1/8 Monday on the Nasdaq to 102 1/4 on
anticipation of the FDA ruling, which was not made until after the
stock market closed.
