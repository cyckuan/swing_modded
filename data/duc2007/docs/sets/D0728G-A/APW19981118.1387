Studies: Two drugs better than one for treating chronic hepatitis

	   A combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved
considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections
than the standard single medicine.
	   Nearly 100 million people worldwide, including 4 million
Americans, are believed to be have hepatitis C. The virus is blamed
for about 10,000 deaths a year in the United States and is the
leading cause of chronic liver disease and the No. 1 reason for
liver transplants.
	   Until recently, interferon was the only treatment. Typically,
only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are
rid of all signs of the virus. Most patients treated with
interferon eventually relapse.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved a new approach, a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
It is being marketed as Rebetron by Schering-Plough, which paid for
two studies published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. T. Jake Liang of the National
Institutes of Health said the results show that ``combination
therapy represents an important advance.''
	   However, Liang cautioned that questions remain about how long
the benefits will last, as well as about such potentially serious
side effects as anemia. The combination can also produce birth
defects, so all users must take birth control during and after
treatment.
	   One of the studies, led by Dr. John G. McHutchison of the
Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California,
compared the effects of the combination with interferon alone in
the initial treatment of 912 patients. All signs of the virus
disappeared in 38 percent of patients who had been given both drugs
for 11 months, compared with 13 percent of those treated with only
interferon.
	   However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered
from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore
throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia.
	   The second study, lead by Dr. Gary L. Davis of the University of
Florida College of Medicine, looked at 345 chronic hepatitis
patients who had already relapsed after interferon treatment. They
were randomly assigned to get either more interferon or the
two-drug combination.
	   When treatment stopped after six months, all signs of the virus
were gone in 82 percent on combination therapy, compared with half
on interferon alone. After another six months had gone by, the
virus was still undetectable in half of the combination patients,
compared with just 5 percent in the interferon group.
