<P>
   Once an avid cyclist who rode 40 miles a day to her job running
a California bed-and-breakfast, Ward no longer could get out of
bed. Debilitating fatigue forced her to abandon the B&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   For three to four months, she would feel well. Then the fatigue
would return with a vengeance, knocking her flat for two weeks to
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It devastated me financially,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered chronic back problems, gastrointestinal disorders,
recurrent yeast infections, fever and night sweats, excruciating
muscle pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going crazy. I thought I was insane,'' says
Ward, 41, who now lives in Phoenix. ``You lay in bed and cry
because your entire body hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   She was treated for countless diseases but continued to
languish.
</P>
<P>
   For almost five months in 1994, she couldn't keep food down and
lived on liquid supplements sipped a few tablespoons every hour.
Her weight slipped from 135 to 102.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors treated her for reflux disease, she improved some
and subsisted on a liquid diet. She was still far from healthy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next year, a holistic doctor told her she had liver
disease. But she tested negative for what ultimately would be her
diagnosis:
</P>
<P>
   hepatitis C, once known by the vague label ``non-A, non-B''
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps 20 years, she would learn, the hepatitis C virus had
been preying on her body, causing chronic inflammation of her
liver, an organ whose job is to detoxify and discard products
produced in the body. It also manufactures proteins, clotting
factors and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   A gastroenterologist finally diagnosed Ward in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C, which experts say is reaching epidemic proportions,
has become the leading reason for liver transplants. Such
celebrities as daredevil Evel Knievel and singer Naomi Judd _ a
former nurse _ have hepatitis C. Rock singer David Crosby underwent
a liver transplant in 1994 after fighting alcoholism and hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   How could Ward have contracted such a nasty disease?
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C most often is passed from person to person by way of
blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, unsterile needles used in
body piercing or tattooing, accidental needle sticks by health-care
workers, and, to a lesser extent, unsafe promiscuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ward says that in her younger days, she dabbled in marijuana and
cocaine. Snorting cocaine can rupture tiny blood vessels in the
nostrils and allow tainted blood to be passed when coke straws are
shared.
</P>
<P>
   She has a tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also has discovered that several former friends who were
patients of her dentist in California have come down with hepatitis
C. Did unsterile dental equipment convey the virus?
</P>
<P>
   She may never know the cause of her disease, but her concern now
is to keep it at bay and ward off the worst of liver ailments _
cirrhosis and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrhosis produces scarring of the liver tissue and prevents it
from performing its detoxification duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that
works on hepatitis C: interferon. She calls it her ``year in
hell.'' Used alone, interferon results in remission in about 20
percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in an experimental program at Mayo Clinic
Scottsdale, she has been giving herself injections of interferon
three times a week. She also has been taking a pill that may be a
drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of
interferon and double its cure rate.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is in a double blind study, she may have been taking
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, interferon treat ment can be nearly as
devastating as the disease it's meant to cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you have the flu all the time,'' says Ward, who
has battled lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast
infections, urinary-tract infections and depression _ all because
of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that her illness is in remission. If the interferon
ultimately proves ineffective, however, she would begin a second
course.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is a financial burden. Ward lives with her elderly
mother, who is blind and has cancer, and depends on public
assistance. She is hoping to find a job and obtain Social Security
disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster her emotional state, she attends a support group for
hepatitis C patients but says that can be troubling. Although she
receives solace from group members, dealing, in turn, with their
woes is saddening.
</P>
<P>
   She would like personal counseling but can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up anything to be able to speak one-on-one with a
counselor once a week,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though her condition has improved, Ward fears a relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm in remission I feel I'm going to get better,'' she
says. ``But what happens six months from now?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At one time, Ward felt guilty about her disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a horrible person because I contracted
hepatitis C,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have been emotionally and financially supportive,
but some relatives refuse to visit her, believing they will become
infected. That is hurtful, Ward says, and adds to the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Now, noting how many other people have hepatitis C _ an
estimated 4 million representing all walks of life _ she no longer
feels shame, which has given her the courage to counsel others.
</P>
<P>
   She even advocates for patients seeking transplants, though she
has decided that she would not undergo transplant surgery herself
if her condition deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal choice,'' she says. ``This is the way I came
into the world, and this is the way I'll leave this world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this disease. I didn't want it, but I have it, and I
have to live with it.'' &QL;
