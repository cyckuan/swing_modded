GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss-Belgian team took off
from a lake-side mountain in the Swiss Alps Sunday in the latest
bid to balloon non-stop around the world, according to reports
from Chateau D'oex, Switzerland.

Swiss Bertrand Piccard and his Belgian team-member Wim
Verstraeten lifted off this morning in the Breitling Orbiter from
Chateau D'oex above Lake Geneva for a journey aimed at
circumnavigating Earth.

The round world trip is expected to take about two weeks.
