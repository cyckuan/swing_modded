   The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a
non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the
Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.
</P>
<P>
   The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21,
has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a
host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane,
which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever
made around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling was built in England, financed and registered in
Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and
Brian Jones, who is British. The pilots completed their three-week
trip when they landed in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055
miles. No previous attempts came even close.

<P>
   Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said
the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn. ``The Breitling
Orbiter 3 will take its place with the Voyager aircraft and with
the Winnie May, the airplane in which Wiley Post made a series of
solo flights taking him completely around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning
expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the
Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to
charities.

   The Breitling company, a maker of specialty watches, announced
that the balloon and its crew capsule would be exhibited in
Switzerland until mid-July at the Lucerne Transport Museum.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented
to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum. Parts of the
balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A Breitling spokesman said the entire balloon crew, including
the pilots and Alan Noble, the mission director, would arrive in
New York City Tuesday to begin a tour of the United States.
