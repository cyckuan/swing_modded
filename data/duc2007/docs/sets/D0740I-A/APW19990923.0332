	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capsule that carried balloonists on the  
first nonstop hot air trip around the globe went on permanent 
display Thursday in the National Air and Space Museum, next to the 
Wright brothers' plane and the craft that carried man to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their  
journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed 
off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling 
Orbiter 3 balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	It rests at ground level in the ``Milestones of Flight''  
gallery, adjacent to the Wright brothers' Flyer, Charles 
Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' Chuck Yeager's supersonic Bell 
X-1 and the Apollo 11 command module. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, an  
international aeronautics body, also presented Piccard and Jones 
with papers certifying three world records: distance, duration and 
shortest time around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for Brian and I, the flight really ends today, because  
finally, after going around the world, the Breitling Orbiter 3 has 
landed,'' said Piccard. ``It's almost like a circle has been 
closed, has been finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones expressed amazement at their accomplishment and new honor.  
</P>
<P>
	``When people use our names in the same sentence as John Glenn,  
Neil Armstrong and the Wright brothers, we still tend to look over 
our shoulders to see who they're talking about. There is a sense of 
disbelief which pervades still and, I think, will last a long 
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, an English balloonist,  
began their journey March 1, lifting away from the village of 
Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland. They headed south, caught favorable 
winds around the equator and circled the Earth from west to east in 
19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes. They landed March 21 in the 
Egyptian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	While the crew's computers showed they traveled 29,056 miles,  
the federation determined that they had traveled 25,361 miles after 
subtracting twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trip, the balloonists lived in a pill-shaped  
pressurized compartment the size of a minivan, flying as high as 
36,000 feet and moving at up to 105 mph. The gondola contains a 
galley, two bunks, a toilet and the instruments and controls to 
operate the balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the cylinders that carried the liquid propane used to  
heat the balloon's 181-foot-tall envelope still hang on the 
outside. The velope itself is too big to be displayed. Instead, the 
public will see a piece of it. Other pieces will be displayed in 
museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides earning a place of distinction in the museum -- part of  
the Smithsonian Institution -- Piccard and Jones have already 
received another reward for their record-breaking journey: 
Anheuser-Busch Cos., the beer brewer, paid them $1 million for 
becoming the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they will use some of the money to start the Winds of  
Hope Foundation, which will award prizes each March 21 to those who 
are committed, in Piccard's words, to ``fighting against forgotten 
sufferances.''
