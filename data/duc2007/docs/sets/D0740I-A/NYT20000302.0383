BALLOONIST NEARLY HALFWAY THROUGH A SOLO TRIP AROUND THE WORLD  
(DW)

<P>
   An Arizona man trying to become the first solo balloonist to
complete a nonstop trip around the world was speeding over India
Thursday, hoping to steer clear of the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through his
journey, which began in Rockford, Ill., on Feb. 22. After some slow
going in the early days of the flight, Uliassi's balloon, the J.
Renee, found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100
miles an hour, said Scott Lorenz, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to fly south of the Himalayas,'' Lorenz said from
the mission's headquarters in Homewood, Ill., near Chicago. ``Right
now it looks like he'll be able to do that.'' Uliassi was flying at
31,000 feet, not much higher than Mt. Everest, and was anticipating
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi has permission to fly over China, which he is expected
to do in the next several days before heading out over the Pacific.
He packed enough fuel for about 20 days, Lorenz said, and thinks he
has enough to complete his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Should Uliassi do so, landing east of Rockford, he would be the
third balloonist to circumnavigate the world nonstop. The first
two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain,
completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Like those two, Uliassi is flying a hybrid balloon called a
Rozier type, which uses two huge sealed nylon bags, one containing
helium and the other air. The air, heated by propane burners, keeps
the helium from contracting at night, helping the balloon to
maintain altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an
unpressurized crew compartment. He has spent most of the trip with
an oxygen mask strapped on his face, and wears a sensor on a finger
that will sound an alarm if the level of oxygen in his blood gets
too low.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi is well rested, Lorenz said, and in good spirits despite
the cramped conditions and thunderstorms over Egypt that bounced
the craft up and down. He communicates with his volunteer support
team by e-mail and satellite phone.
</P>
<P>
   This is Uliassi's second attempt to fly around the world. The
first, in 1997, ended several hours after liftoff when his balloon
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, a mechanical engineer, designed the 140-foot balloon
with some assistance from his wife, after whom it is named. In
particular, she helped him with the crew compartment, marking the
dimensions around him as he lay on the floor of their Scottsdale
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had it to do all over again,'' Lorenz said, ``he'd build
it one foot bigger all the way around.''
