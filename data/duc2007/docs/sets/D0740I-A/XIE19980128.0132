GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Europeans were preparing
Wednesday to set off from Switzerland in the quest to circle the
world non-stop in a balloon, spokesman Gerard Sermier said.
</P>
<P>
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten
from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were
planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) from Chateau d'Oex,
in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II.
</P>
<P>
The balloonists' plan is to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters
and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
From there, they hope to ride jetstreams that should move them
along in an east-bound direction at around 200 kilometers an hour
at 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
If luck holds, Brietling Orbiter II will complete its
globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
</P>
<P>
British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who plans to set off from
Morocco in a few days in a rival attempt to circle the world,
wished the Brietling Orbiter II team good luck.
