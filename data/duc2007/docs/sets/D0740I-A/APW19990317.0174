	Budget Approved by House Committee  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday. By a 22-18 
party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending 
plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social 
Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing 
defense, education and several other programs. Simultaneously, the 
Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan.

	Weapons Labs To Be More Secure  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new  
security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and 
ordered an internal investigation into whether a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese 
espionage. Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door 
hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee was 
questioning Richardson on how the Clinton administration responded 
when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft 
of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in the 1980s.

	Train Probe Hinges on Tire Marks  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Investigators are analyzing tire tracks  
in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a 
deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and 
beat the train. The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's 
City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's 
deadliest train wreck in three years. Tire marks were found on the 
road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder 
of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National 
Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.

	African Life Expectancy Cut by AIDS  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AIDS has cut the average life expectancy in  
Zimbabwe by a quarter-century, the U.S. Census Bureau reports. Life 
expectancy in Zimbabwe is now 39 years, down from 65 were it not 
for the AIDS epidemic, the bureau said in a report being released 
Thursday. Other African nations also have experienced significant 
reductions in life expectancy because of AIDS. ``AIDS results in 
higher mortality rates in childhood, as well as among young adults 
where mortality otherwise is low,'' said a contributing author of 
the Census Bureau's new report, ``World Population Profile: 1998.''

	Balloon Team Flies Over Caribbean  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team was about 300 miles  
from Jamaica late Wednesday night. The team hoped to catch the next 
jet stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said. The 
pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, 
hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by 
Saturday evening. If they make it, the pair will have conquered one 
of the last great challenges facing aviators. Jones and Piccard 
have traveled more than 20,500 miles since lifting off from the 
Swiss Alps on March 1.

	Hale-Bopp May Be a Cosmic Leftover  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The comet Hale-Bopp may be brimming with some of  
the primordial material from which the sun and the planets formed 
more than 4 billion years ago, researchers reported Thursday in the 
journal Nature. California Institute of Technology scientists who 
tuned radio telescopes onto the comet's nucleus as it cut across 
the solar system in 1997 found vents spewing a volatile mixture of 
gas and dust into space. Comets are often called dirty snowballs. 
Most orbit far from the sun in the deep freeze beyond Pluto's 
orbit. That enables them to remain virtually unchanged over 
billions of years.
