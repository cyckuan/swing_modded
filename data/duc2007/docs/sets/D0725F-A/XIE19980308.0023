<HEADLINE> Iran: No Nuclear Agreement With Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Stressing that it has no nuclear
cooperation program with Ukraine, Iran Saturday expressed
"surprise" at Kiev's announcement to cancel a nuclear contract
with it, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has no agreement with Ukraine on manufacturing turbines
for (its) nuclear reactors and it is surprising that Ukraine has
made such a claim," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said on Friday
that Kiev has decided to annul a contract to supply turbines to
the Russia-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Russia's assistance for Iran in the field has triggered
accusations from the United States and Israel that Iran is seeking
the technology for developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
It is noted Ukraine's move was made when U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's nuclear activities are for peaceful means, Mohammadi
said, stressing that it complies with international regulations
and puts the nuclear activities under the supervision of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The baseless ballyhoos of the U.S. and Israel are aimed at
blocking the development of other countries, which is their
legitimate right, he said.
</P>
<P>
He contended that Iran will not deprive itself of utilizing
nuclear technology for its development drive.
