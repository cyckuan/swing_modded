<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Israeli Allegation on Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran has rejected as
"unfounded" an allegation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that Iran is seeking access to atomic warheads.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Reza Asefi, the spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry,
said Sunday the allegation was fabricated by Israel with the mere
objective to divert the public opinion from dangerous schemes of
Israel, "which has turned the region into a depot of nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu voiced Israel's concern over Iran's nuclear programs
after Tehran and Moscow signed a memorandum of understanding last
Tuesday to promote their nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum signed at the end of a visit by Russian
Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov to Iran, the two
countries will form expert groups to discuss building more
nuclear power plants in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"As the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly announced,
Iran-Russia nuclear cooperation is for peaceful purposes" and Iran
carries out its peaceful atomic programs under the supervision of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, Asefi pointed out that Iran considers self-defense
based on internationally recognized principles as its legitimate
right.
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear plant in Bushehr in
southern Bushehr province according to a contract concluded in
1994 between the two countries.
