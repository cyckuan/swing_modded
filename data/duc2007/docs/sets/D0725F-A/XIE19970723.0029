transparent and for humanitarian purposes. We always welcome
sharing experience with respective international agencies."

IAEA, saying Iran allows the agency to inspect any nuclear center
in Iran at any time.

conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability

biased for political ends.

to use nuclear technology for military purposes.

The U.S. and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive
air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port
city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic
bomb.

Iran is finishing the power plant with help from Russia.
Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv
to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will
be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf.
