TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday strongly
lambasted the United States for its accusations against
Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation, accusing Washington of
supporting Israeli nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the
accusations indicated the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iran,
adding that the United States has spared no opportunity to stop
Iran's economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's nuclear cooperation with Russia is fully for civilian
application of nuclear energy and is taking place within the
framework of international regulations," the Iranian official news
agency IRNA quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran and Russia have been committed to
controlling the export of the nuclear energy from either country
in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping Iran build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power
plant in Bushehr, southern Iran. U.S. officials repeatedly accused
Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons
through building nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also attacked Washington for providing financial
assistance to Israel to modernize its military arsenal.
</P>
<P>
He said that by accusing Iran of attempting to acquire weapons
of mass destruction, the U.S. has attempted to justify its
dangerous plan to arm Israel "which possesses weapons of mass
destruction and is the main threat to the security and stability
of the region."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran always wants the Middle East free from
weapons of mass destruction, urging the international community to
pressure Israel to eliminate all its weapons of mass destruction
and force the U.S. to abandon its dangerous policy of supporting
the Jewish state.

Meanwhile, reports reaching here said that Russian Minister of
Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov on Wednesday also stressed that the
nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran centers on peaceful
application of nuclear power.

He noted that Moscow-Tehran cooperation fully observes the NPT
and is under the supervision of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
