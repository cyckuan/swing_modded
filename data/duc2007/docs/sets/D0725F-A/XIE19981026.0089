<HEADLINE> Iran's Defense Budget Unchanged over 4 Years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has said that it's defense
budget has remained unchanged over the past four years and
actually had a drop if taking the inflation into account.
</P>
<P>
Keyvan Khosravi, press advisor to the Iranian defense minister,
said on Sunday in an interview with the official news agency IRNA
released on Monday that Iran's defense spending is driven by needs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has been able to maintain a proper defensive
capability in spite of the low spending in the sector thanks in
part to the country's reliance on domestic resources for its
defense needs.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting reports by some foreign media which claimed a 20
percent increase in Iran's defense budget, Khosravi said that
"undoubtedly, Iran has the lowest defense budget among Middle
East countries."
</P>
<P>
The official did not mention the figure of defense budget in
the current Iranian year (starting from March 21). But according
to the budget approved by the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) in
March, this year's defense budget stands at 2.89 trillion rials
(1.65 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval
commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying
that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently
confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the official said, adding that based on its convictions, Iran
regards as inhuman the development of nuclear energy for
non-peaceful purposes.
