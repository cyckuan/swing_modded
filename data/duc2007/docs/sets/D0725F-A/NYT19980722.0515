   WASHINGTON _ Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on
Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of
hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, and of altering the political and
military balance of power in the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of
Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the test
on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were still
poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they
believe Iran bought from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are certain that Iran successfully tested the
medium-range missile, but could not provide immediate information
on the location of the launching site or the area where it landed
except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence official familiar with the spread of such
weapons said: ``The major reaction to this is going to be from
Israel and we have to worry what action the Israelis will take,
because the Israelis clearly view the Iranians as their main threat
in the Middle East.'' Israel is the only nuclear power in the
region, and its missiles are believed to be capable of striking any
nation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed
to be years away from building and testing such a weapon. But the
United States is not certain of the size or sophistication of its
programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The test on Wednesday comes as the United States and Iran have
been making cautious overtures toward improving relations, after a
long chill. Just last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
praised President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last
summer and who has confronted considerable resistance from
religious and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Albright, in a speech devoted to steps for improving
relations, also called on Iran to show evidence that it was not
trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not
its intentions, officials said. ``This is a demonstration of Iran's
perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside
the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said. ``It's now
clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he
said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a
missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a
large-scale force are two very different things. It could take
years for Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our
best to retard that.''
</P>
<P>
   Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came
from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons
to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The official North Korean news agency issued a statement last
month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining
foreign money we need at present.'' U.S. intelligence officials say
millions of dollars that Iran has paid North Korean is invested in
more missile production rather than in civilian needs.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has
bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
Tehran's foremost goal, a senior administration official said, is
not to strike its enemies but to be seen as a political and
military force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some prestige element here,'' he said. ``We have long
thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give
them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it
serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the
development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments
of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as
attempting to learn what local military and technological
capability Iran had developed.
</P>
<P>
   The former intelligence official said that government experts
had expected a test by Iran, although the launch was not expected
so soon. He also said that the test held political significance as
well as military meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these
missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as
anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement
is: `You are now vulnerable. You have to take us seriously.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doubted that the Iranians meant to be belligerent
toward the Saudis, saying ``They want to co-opt the Saudis, not
threaten them.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic
missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology
as well as North Korean technology, for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point here is that they have very little
indigenous internal capability to make a real missile, and they've
required extensive outside technical support,'' this former
official said. ``But they've been willing to spend the money. I'd
guess the Rodong would cost $10 million,'' referring to the North
Korean missile.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from
North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting ability, he
said. But it proves the Iranians have passed a milestone in
military technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term,'' he said, ``the missile production
assistance they've gotten from Russia and China will have the
greater impact. But the Rodongs are the attention-getters.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has a well-established Scud missile program dating back to
the war with Iraq of the 1980s. That war, a U.S. intelligence
analyst said on Wednesday, ``gave them the experience of using
missiles as a weapon of terror, both at receiving and delivering
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   In that war both nations attacked their opponent's major cities
with short range missiles and Tehran was all but evacuated at
times. Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year
U.N. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they were certain only that Wednesday's
missile test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or
perhaps identical to the Korean Rodong missile. Beyond that, they
were struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the
test. ``Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves or whether
they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong _ either
way, this is a North Korean missile with another name.'' said the
senior official.
</P>
<P>
   The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that they have had some success
in limiting Russian and Chinese military assistance to Iran. Russia
said last week it was investigating nine companies for illegally
providing weapons technology to Iran, and the United States imposed
trade restrictions on those firms.
