<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Senior Iranian officials on
Monday assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative
Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and First Deputy Speaker
Hassan Rouhani in their separate meetings with visiting Russian
Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov.
</P>
<P>
It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear
Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons,
Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the
construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran,
defying pressures of the United States, which has repeatedly
attempted to convince Russia not to cooperate on the project.
</P>
<P>
Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran
could aid Iran's alleged nuclear weapons plans, but Russia argued
that the plant is purely for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Nouri criticized the United States for its opposition to
Tehran-Moscow nuclear cooperation, saying that Washington is
against, through every possible means, those countries which
resist its expansionist goals.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker complained Washington's double standard in
the nuclear non-proliferation issue.
</P>
<P>
No objection has been made to Israel, which has acquired
nuclear weapons but refused to join the international disarmament
convention, because of U.S. support for that regime, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with Tehran-Moscow relations, Nouri
said the two countries should strive for further expansion of
their ties.
</P>
<P>
He named oil, gas, plane manufacturing and technical fields as
suitable grounds for Iran and Russia to promote their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Adamov, Rouhani said Iran is for a Middle
East free of nuclear weapons within the framework of the NPT,
expressing the hope that the agreements between the two countries
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Adamov briefed Iranian officials on Russia's measures to
complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Since Russia is sure that Iran will use atomic energy for
peaceful purposes, it resists pressures from a third country to
cut cooperation with Iran, the Russian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Adamov, who arrived here on Saturday, said that Russian
political and parliamentary officials are firmly determined to
expand multi-faceted cooperation with Iran.
