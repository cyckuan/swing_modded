<HEADLINE> U.S. Has Iran Nuclear Concerns  </HEADLINE>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday
over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability
to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue to work hard to block those efforts,'' White House
national security spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials were not pleased with reports Friday from Moscow that Iran
may order from Russia an additional three nuclear reactors for power generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Russia insists
its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view
the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has
told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make
a nuclear weapon. CIA Director George Tenet has been briefing other U.S.
policy-makers on the new assessment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Security officials would not comment directly on the report but
agreed that the possibility that Iran may be able to manufacture nuclear weapons
has been a growing worry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop
ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence and defense experts warned that Iran may be closer than
previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior intelligence official said the United States is watching closely
the worrisome problem of availability of fissionable material to Iran, which
could use it to make nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of
Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert
nuclear materials to weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   A reason for differing estimates, officials said, is the difficulty in
monitoring Iran's acquisition of nuclear materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional
intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach
targets in the United States by 2010. Officials now suggest the timetable might
have to be shortened in light of the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. efforts to persuade Russia to stop providing nuclear technology to Iran
have met with little success.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian engineers already are building a reactor at a site in southern Iran
under an existing contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran also has become a top customer of Russia's ailing defense industry with
purchases of fighter jets, missiles, tanks and submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   On several occasions, Congress has sought to impose sanctions on countries
helping Iran develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, an intention aimed
primarily at Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology
and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons
and missiles to carry them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials as well as military-minded members of Congress have used
the possibility of nuclear attacks from Iran, North Korea and other potential
U.S. enemies as a major rationale for moving to develop a national missile
defense.
