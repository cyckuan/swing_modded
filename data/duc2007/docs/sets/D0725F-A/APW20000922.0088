   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A day after test-firing a new long-range
missile, Iran's regular army began its largest military exercises
of the year Friday in mountainous terrain near the Iraqi border,
state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day maneuvers in the western Kurdistan province were
being supervised by top Iranian military commanders and involved
airborne units and ground troops using radar interception systems,
the broadcast said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of troops participating was not known.
</P>
<P>
   ''The maneuvers are aimed at testing the army's defense
capability and its military might,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The war games, code-named Zolfaqar-3, began a day after Iran
test-fired its first solid-liquid fuel missile, raising concerns in
Israel and in Washington that Iran is developing its long-range
offensive missile capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Defense Minister Vice Adm. Ali Shamkhani said the
Shahab-3D missile would be used for nonmilitary purposes, such as
launching satellites, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
Shamkhani insisted Iran did not produce offensive weapons, the
agency added.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington and Israel, the test caused serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard their aggressive efforts to develop missile
capability as a serious threat,'' a State Department deputy
spokesman, Philip Reeker, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh said that the
missile development program, coupled with a parallel effort to
build a nuclear warhead, spelled danger not only for Israel but for
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This the second test in a short time. It's now obvious that
Iran embarking on a colossal effort to build a long-range missile
capability,'' he said. ''It means that in a few years time, Iran
will be able to threaten with a nuclear weapon, a very broad part
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has built and tested a number of missiles, including the
Shahab-3 which has a range of 810 miles. Washington denounced a
July test of the Shahab-3, which it said could reach Israel or U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
