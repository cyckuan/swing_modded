<HEADLINE> Iran Does not Have Nuclear Capability: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has neither the
technological capability nor the intention of making nuclear
weapons, said Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Nikitovich
Mikhailov on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov was responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's recent remarks indicating that Iran is making atomic
weapons, the Interfax Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), Mikhailov said, adding that the IAEA has inspected the
nuclear facilities in Iran many times but discovered no problems.
</P>
<P>
And the minister stressed that the nuclear power station to be
built by Iran with Russian assistance is purely for peaceful use.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want
to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian
nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly asked Moscow to abandon its plan to
help Tehran build a nuclear power station under an agreement
between the two countries signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Russia has so far refused to yield to U.S. pressure even though
the U.S. has threatened to suspend economic assistance to Russia.
