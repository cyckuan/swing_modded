MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated Thursday that
its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms
to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including
those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran's activity in the nuclear sphere is being controlled by
the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has not reported any
violations on the part of that country, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has just
returned from a visit to Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
During Adamov's visit to Tehran, the two countries signed an
agreement to accelerate the construction of a nuclear reactor in
Bushehr and contemplate possible cooperation in building more
nuclear power stations in Iran.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently
criticized the Russia-Iran agreement as a threat to the entire
region. He expressed hope that Russia will revise this initiative
because, he said, it contradicts attempts to achieve peace and
stability in the region, Interfax reported.
