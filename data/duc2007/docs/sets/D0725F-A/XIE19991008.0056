<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Elimination of Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday appealed the
international community for practical steps to reinforce the
treaty on disarmament and for elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Legal and International Affairs Javad Zarif in Vienna, according
to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
As long as nuclear arsenal exists in the world, the
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) will not succeed, said the minister
who was attending a three-day conference on Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which opened in Vienna on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT is a prerequisite for the NPT and the international
community should take actions in safeguarding the peaceful use of
nuclear technology, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The NPT should be used to reinforce disarmament and the
peaceful use of nuclear technology as well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain
nuclear capability, a charge repeatedly denied by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it was pursuing peaceful use of nuclear energy in
different fields, which is an inalienable right of any country in
the world.
