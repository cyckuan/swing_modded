<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran React to Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>

CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia called on India and
Pakistan to show great self-restraint, saying that nuclear tests
conducted by both countries do not serve security and stability in
the region, Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Al-Faresi was quoted as
saying that his country understood the viewpoint of Pakistani
government as to safeguarding its security, but "we still calls on
both Pakistan and India to practice self-restraint and resume
negotiations to ensure security and stability in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
Al-Faresi made the remarks in a statement after the weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country hopes the international community to
avoid double-standard policy which turns a blind eye to Israel's
nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia supports a full ban of nuclear proliferation and
seeks to make the Middle East a region free of mass-destruction
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and
May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said on Monday
that Tehran is against any nuclear test intended for weapon
purposes, but favors civilian use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
With Russian assistance, Iran is building a nuclear power plant
in Bushehr in the south. This has raised doubt that Tehran may be
seeking access to nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iran wants the Middle East and the Persian Gulf to be free
from non-conventional weapons," Shamkhani said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran supports compliance with the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty, but
holds that elimination of non-conventional weapons and disarmament
of Israel are prerequisites for banning proliferation of nuclear
arms.
