India's prime minister keen to meet Pakistani counterpart

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister said Friday he
looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart later this
month to discuss the issues over which they fought two wars and
launched a nuclear arms race.
	   ``India and Pakistan have to live together. We can't change the
geography and will have to live like good neighbors,'' United News
of India news agency quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as
telling Parliament.
	   Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in
the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a
seven-nation regional group.
	   Vajpayee said India is prepared for talks with Pakistan _
without the involvement of any other nation _ in resolving their
disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the Himalayan state of
Kashmir.
	   He repeated his call on Pakistan to enter into a no-first-use
nuclear weapons agreement with India.
	   Vajpayee also said India wants to resolve a border dispute with
China that has chilled relations between both nations.
	   India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May,
saying it needed a nuclear deterrent due to threats from China and
Pakistan. Pakistan responded with its own tests.
	   Following the tests, the United States, Britain, Japan and other
industrialized nations imposed economic and military sanctions on
both India and Pakistan. They also urged both of them to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which they have refused to do for years.
	   India says the treaties are flawed because they allow nations
with sophisticated nuclear weapons to keep their arsenals.
	   On Friday, Vajpayee said India is prepared to discuss the test
ban treaty.
	   ``However, nobody should feel that we are ready to participate
because we are weak,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to exempt
agriculture credits from nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and
India. The move will help U.S. farmers who are desperate for
markets sell wheat and other products in South Asia.
