	   Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has slammed the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council for their double
standards on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), saying the
world body has been sued as an instrument for achieving narrow
strategic objectives of some countries. Describing the NPT as
discriminatory, Sharif, in an interview to Emirates News, said some
nuclear weapon states have sought to justify their retention of
nuclear weapons on the basis of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence,
when none of them is threatened, directly or indirectly, in the
post cold-war era. Sharif's comments came a day after the security
council condemned the nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan last
month asking them to stop testing and sign NPT and CTBT. Sharif,
who is presently in the UAE, also said despite confessing
commitment to non-proliferation, the major powers have failed to
honour these obligations under the NPT.
	   Sharif reiterated his offer for the resumption of dialogue
process with India and said it is upto India...to agree to a
serious, substantive and meaningful dialogue on all outstanding
issues, including Kashmir, in accordance with the UN resolutions.
When asked about the possible agenda for such a dialogue, he said
agenda has already been finalised while referring to an agreement
between India and Pakistan in June last year when eight outstanding
issues had been identified. AFP Adds: Pakistan yesterday rejected
the United Nations call to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), saying the security council approach had been
``unjust and unrealistic.'' It also regretted that the security
council failed to deal ``adequately'' with its dispute with India
over Kashmir which has endangered peace and security in the region.
'The council has ignored the reality on the ground'' a foreign
office spokesman here said, after an overnight UN resolution urged
India and Pakistan to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) as non-nuclear states.
	   'Treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties,'' the
spokesman said in a statement, adding that treaty provisions could
only be assumed only on a ``voluntary basis.'' 'Any attempts at
imposition of treaty obligations is by its very nature unequal and
unsustainable,'' he added. Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices
last month ``to correct (the) strategic imbalance'' triggered by
five underground nuclear tests by its rival India on May 11 and 13.
Pakistan said the explosions were imperative to ensure its security
which had been threatened by the Indian action. The two south Asian
neighbours, who have squared off in three wars since independence
50 years ago, with two of them fought over the festering Kashmir
problem, earlier refused to join the NPT. The foreign office
spokesman also 'regretted'' that the council resolution did not
deal ``adequately and effectively with the urgent and core issues
that have endangered peace and security in South Asia.''
