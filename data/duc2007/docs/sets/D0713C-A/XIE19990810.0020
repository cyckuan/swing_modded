KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
renewed its support to efforts in eliminating weapons of mass
destruction, especially in the Middle East region, the Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh is "looking forward to seeing the Middle East region
free of all kinds of mass destruction weapons," said Saudi Crown
Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a
weekly cabinet session he chaired in the country's western city of
Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to
join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear
facilities to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's remarks came after Saudi Second Prime Minister and
Defense and Aviation Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz denied any
Saudi attempts to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan or any
other country.

<P>
In response to a question over his visit to a uranium
enrichment plant and a missile factory in Pakistan, Sultan said it
did not "exceed the entrances of the sites and did not include
secret facilities as reported."

<P>
Earlier reports said that British officials were worried that
Riyadh might have sought to buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan.
