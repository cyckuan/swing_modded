<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Concerned About Pakistan's Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran have expressed
concern over the underground nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan
to match India's five explosions two week ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday said that
the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan were of
concern for regional and global stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two neighboring countries should
refrain from a reciprocal show of power and should solve their
disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey wishes that this alarming development recorded in the
recent weeks will not pave the way for a new nuclear arms race,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan detonated five underground nuclear devices Thursday,
widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests on May
11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
Iran has called on Pakistan and India to cease nuclear tests
and rivalry and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on
Thursday that Iran follows with deep concern the ongoing chain of
events concerning nuclear tests, the official news agency IRNA
said in a delayed report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the current nuclear race poses a serious
threat and danger to regional peace and stability, a race which is
first and foremost the consequence of lack of political will on
the part of the nuclear powers to heed the call of international
community for a comprehensive nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that in the absence of an
all-encompassing program for comprehensive nuclear disarmament,
the status and future of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would
face great uncertainty.
