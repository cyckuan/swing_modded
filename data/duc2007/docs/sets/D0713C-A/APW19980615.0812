	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland will slash its development
aid to India and Pakistan because of the two countries' nuclear
tests, the Swiss government said Monday.
	   Officials in the capital Bern said the aid would be cut by 4-5
million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.6-3.3 million) for the 1998/99
financial year.
	   The government is to review its development programs in India
and Pakistan and won't approve any new projects or credit in the
meantime, officials said.
	   In view of the ``tension which reigns in the Indian
sub-continent,'' arms exports to the two countries will also be
halted for the time being, officials added.
	   The Swiss authorities have already condemned the two countries'
tests and urged their governments to refrain from further nuclear
testing and adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
