<HEADLINE> Pakistan Praises China's Nuclear Stance, Condemns India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday described China's stance on the
nuclear issue as "mature and highly responsible."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "in sharp contrast to the irresponsible stance
of India."
</P>
<P>
"As you know, China is the only nuclear weapon state which has
repeatedly and authoritatively stated that it will never under any
circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons," Shamshad told
reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport after
concluding a two-day visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"This mature and highly responsible approach to issues of
international peace and security by China stands in sharp contrast
to the irresponsible statements emanating from the Indian
leadership, threatening the use of nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has
always advocated international peace and security and nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and
China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from
India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China,
invented by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic
designs and aggressive agenda in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has already condemned in the strongest
terms the outrageous actions of the Indian government to introduce
nuclear weapons in South Asia which has destabilized the strategic
balance in our region."
</P>
<P>
"Our consultations with China are indeed an important facet of
our wider consultations with all major powers as well as friendly
countries to seek ways and means to effectively defuse tension and
reduce the factors that have threatened peace and stability in our
region," he said.
