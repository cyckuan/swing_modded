	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An international meeting Thursday on
India's nuclear rivalry with neighboring Pakistan likely means that
the world's five original nuclear powers will address the main
dispute between the two countries: Kashmir.
	   The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways
to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race. India and
Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both
are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
	   No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three
times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing
Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of
Economics' Asia Research Center.
	   One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by
officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both
countries claim.
	   ``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I
think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain
said.
	   Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be
addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists
it remain a bilateral issue. Now, Hussain said, India fears the
Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
	   India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while
Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting
Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
rejected the possibility of international mediation. Vajpayee
repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
	   On Thursday, Vajpayee told Parliament that India would welcome
any international initiative on global disarmament, but said
focusing on South Asia alone was unfair.
	   Vajpayee also said India and Pakistan were under ``unwarranted''
pressure to sign a global test ban treaty. India has long spurned
both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because
they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States to give up their nuclear arsenals.
	   The five foreign secretaries, meeting in Geneva as the permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, were expected to call on
India to sign the NPT and the CTBT.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory shut
down shops and cleared streets of traffic with a general strike in
the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state Thursday, saying they
believe the world was now paying attention to their protests.
	   ``Unless the issue (of Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of
the people under international principles, peace will not return to
the Indian subcontinent,'' said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All
Parties Hurriet Conference called the strike in Srinagar city. The
conference is a coalition of parties who want Indian-held Kashmir
to break away either to form an independent country or join
Pakistan.
	   India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training
anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only
moral support.
