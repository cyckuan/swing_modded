<HEADLINE> No CTBT Clause to Affect Pak Nuclear Program: Qadeer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's scientists Dr.
Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said here Monday that no
clause of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will affect
Pakistan's nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for the members of the two houses of Parliament,
the two renowned scientists said there is no need to further
nuclear tests at present as Pakistan has achieved its objectives
from the tests conducted on May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
"The CTBT cannot take away anything of us that we have achieved
as a result of nuclear blasts. WE can maintain our nuclear
capability without conducting more tests," Qadeer said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said there would be no cut in the present stock
material.
</P>
<P>
Qadeer said Pakistan maintained its nuclear capability for a
long time without conducting test. "We conducted nuclear tests on
May 28 and 30 to convey the message to the world that Pakistan has
become a nuclear power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked as to whether Pakistan would open its nuclear
installations for inspection after signing the CTBT, Qadeer said,
"there is no clause in the Treaty which allows inspection. The
Treaty only bars new tests."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistan has already announced moratorium on
nuclear tests.
