	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia has become the 24th country to
ratify the Ottawa Convention banning land mines.
	   The ban on use, production and stockpiling of the anti-personnel
weapon has been signed by 127 countries. The treaty must be
ratified by 40 countries to become official.
	   The National Assembly ratified the treaty on Wednesday.
	   The treaty also requires member states to destroy existing
mines.
	   Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said Namibia, located on
Africa's southwest Atlantic coast, would keep a small number of
mines for training in destruction and research.
	   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its former
leader Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for their
work in bringing world attention to the issue.
