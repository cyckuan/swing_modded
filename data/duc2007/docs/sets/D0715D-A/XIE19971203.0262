KIEV, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not be among the
first batch to sign the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines,
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman told a news briefing that Ukraine rejected
the signing because the destruction of anti-personnel weapons
needed a large amount of money and Ukraine could not afford the
financial burden.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not rule out a possible signing in the future.
</P>
<P>
A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in
Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are
expected to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, signatories will be required to destroy their
reserves of land mines within four years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Ukraine stopped manufacturing mines and had
suspended mine exports since 1995.
