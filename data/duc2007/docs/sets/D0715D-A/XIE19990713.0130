<P>
MAPUTO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Anti-landmine
Campaign has called upon the parliaments of the Community of
Portuguese-speaking States to approve the Ottawa Convention, which
bans production, use and stock of lethal land mines, as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The anti-landmine group said in a statement carried by the
Noticias newspaper that the use of lethal land mines is violation
of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the heads of parliament of Mozambique,
Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome
and Principe to rethink of the issue of land mines and to support
the Ottawa Convention so as to make the whole world free from such
mines by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking
States have signed and approved the anti-landmine convention, but
more than 50 countries have not approved the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret that the Angolan government and
the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
against the convention, are still using lethal land mines, killing
and maiming innocent people, and women and children in particular.
</P>
<P>
It called upon Portugal, the only member of the Community of
Portuguese- speaking States which is able to produce lethal land
mines, to stop the mine production and destroy the land mines in
stock.
</P>
<P>
It further asked the Portuguese-speaking countries to exert
influence upon the governments concerned in a bid to help the
victims of land mines and accelerate the demining process around
the world.
