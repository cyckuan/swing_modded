MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The First Meeting of States Parties
(FMSP) to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and
on Their Destruction (the "Ottawa Treaty") opened here Monday with
over 1,000 participants from 72 countries and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting here in Maputo, Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano said the meeting offered a good opportunity for
mapping out strategies to eliminate anti-personnel land mines to
rid peoples of the world of their danger.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all parties will coordinate and
reach consensus at the meeting to achieve the goal of rooting out
land mines in ten years time.
</P>
<P>
Surveys showed that a total of two million mines have been
planted all over Mozambique during the country's civil war.
Therefore, said the president, it will take about 160 years to
clear all the mines at the current rate of removing 11,000 mines
per year.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries,
74 of which have ratified it. Its ambitious goal is to clear all
the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million,
before the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
Chissano called on joint efforts by all countries and the
international community to implement the Treaty, which was
effective in September, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The issue of anti-personnel mines has topped the political
itinerary of southern Africa. The 1997 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) summit in Malawi issued a declaration
asking all SADC members to prohibit anti-personnel mines, treating
it as a national policy.
</P>
<P>
The president revealed that a SADC de-mining committee has been
set up to coordinate efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all signatories to the Treaty to ratify it as
soon as possible, and those who have not signed the Treaty to do
it.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening were also Louise Frechette, assistant
secretary- general of the United Nations, and Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary -general of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to end on May 7.
