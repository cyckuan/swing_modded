<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is poised to ratify
the Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 after the army submitted the letter of
affirmation to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, The Nation
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After several months of vetting and delay, the Permanent
Secretary's Office of Defense informed the Foreign Ministry, which
is coordinating preparations for the ratification process of the
treaty, that it is agreeable to the original text and the Thai
translation. The air force and navy have both submitted their
letters of affirmation to the ministry. The Interior Ministry and
the National Security Council have yet to reply.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which will become an international law in March
next year, imposes a comprehensive ban on using, stockpiling,
producing and transporting anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would need at least 800 million baht (21 million U.S.
dollars) to clear mines and rehabilitate the victims of land
mines.
