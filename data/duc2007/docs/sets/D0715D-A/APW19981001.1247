	   UNITED NATION (AP) _ A Nobel Peace Prize winner, a queen, a
billionaire financier, a foreign minister and the U.N. deputy
secretary-general joined forces Thursday to fight the next battles
in the campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines.
	   With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every
nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to
kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
	   And they launched a new fund, which already has contributions
and pledges of over dlrs 1.3 million.
	   ``We have never thought that the treaty itself was victory,''
said Jody Williams, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her six
year crusade with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines that
resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa in December.
	   The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots
organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess
Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for
action on a range of international humanitarian issues including
curbing small arms.
	   The news conference in the U.N. Trusteeship Chamber launching
the land mine campaign's next battlegrounds reflected the new
alliance: Williams was flanked by Axworthy, Queen Noor of Jordan,
billionaire financier George Soros, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechette and Norway's U.N. Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby.
	   The queen recalled that she and her husband, King Hussein, were
driving in Minnesota, where he is receiving cancer treatment, when
they received a call on Sept. 16 that Burkina Faso had become the
40th nation to ratify the land mine treaty _ which meant it would
go into effect in March 1999.
	   ``There was a huge `whoopie' that emanated from this car ...
throughout the Minnesota countryside that I know was just a faint
echo of jubilation that would have been spreading around the world
at that time,'' she said.
	   Since mid-September, five more nations have ratified the treaty,
most recently Japan. Axworthy said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was
``so enthusiastic'' that he woke him at 6 a.m. to tell him about
the ratification.
	   ``It just continues to demonstrate the momentum in the world to
make this thing real,'' Williams said.
	   Noor said it was encouraging that major producers and exporters
including France, Germany, Britain and Hungary had already ratified
the treaty.
	   But the United States has refused to sign the convention,
maintaining that land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are
also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   While the United States has pledged money for demining efforts
and assisting victims, Soros said to enthusiastic applause: ``I
think the greatest contribution they could make actually is signing
the treaty.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve
the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come
up with an alternative weapon by then.
	   Williams, an American, urged governments and private
institutions to contribute to a fund set up with the dlrs 500,000
which the International Campaign received as co-winner of the Nobel
prize to continue the campaign's activities ``until we truly
eradicate this weapon and aid all the victims.''
	   Soros pledged dlrs 300,000 and urged the private sector to
contribute.
	   ``I think that there is plenty of money out there and I hope
that it will rise to the occasion,'' he said. ``This has to be a
long-range commitment. ... While we are celebrating, land mines are
being used in Kosovo, for instance.''
	   Axworthy announced a 300,000 Canadian dollar contribution (U.S.
dlrs 196,000). Kolby announced a Norwegian contribution of dlrs
200,000. And Williams said Ireland last week donated dlrs 150,000.
