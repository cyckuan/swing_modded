<HEADLINE>  U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban land mines that  
kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force 
today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133  
countries and ratified by 65 of them. About 12 countries have 
destroyed their entire stocks of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Major users and producers -- including the United States, Russia  
and China -- have refused to join in. And even with the treaty, it 
will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines 
scattered in more than 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not  
just in law but also in implementation,'' U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the  
fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle 
but in practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six  
others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern 
Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, agreed to after a campaign by charities working with  
victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, stocks and 
exports of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the  
accord -- saying the United States needs to use mines until then 
along the tense border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Seats for the U.S. delegation were conspicuously empty at the  
start of a ceremony marking the land mines accord at U.N. 
headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of a ``peace bell'' and a children's choir floated  
through U.N. offices in Vienna, Austria, to mark the accord coming 
into force. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban  
Land Mines -- which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize -- said her group 
would this year focus its campaign on the Middle East and former 
Soviet Union to try to persuade them to go along with the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause also was supported by Princess Diana. Diana drew  
attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk through a 
minefield in Angola in February 1997. She died in a car crash in 
Paris on Aug. 31 of that year.
