<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Sign Land Mine Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy today failed to take Lebanon into signing the
Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines during meetings with
Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Axworthy, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz said if Israel signs the treaty, it will become easier for
Lebanon to sign it. Lebanon is concerned about the issue, but it
is impossible for Lebanon to sign it while Israel is outside it,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry expressed the same idea at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the signing to the ban because the Islamic
resistance in the south uses anti-personnel weapons in its fight
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy explained to reporters at a joint news conference
with Boueiz that the aim of signing the treaty is to help the
countries concerned remove the mines and provide victims with
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived in Beirut Thursday night on his ongoing tour
of the region aimed at drumming up support for the treaty that
prohibits the manufacture, trade and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
</P>
<P>
In addition to talks with Lebanese leaders, including President
Elias Hrawi, Axworthy went to the country's southern port city of
Saida Friday afternoon to meet with a group of children victims of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
Canada signed the treaty several months ago and destroyed its
last land mine last week.
</P>
<P>
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on
December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to
sign the treaty. Canada hoped Lebanon can be among the first batch
to sign.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast tour has taken the Canadian foreign minister to
Egypt, Israel and Jordan, and will take him to Syria Friday
night.
