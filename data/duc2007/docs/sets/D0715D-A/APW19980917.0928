	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders and international
organizations on Thursday praised the quick ratification of a
treaty aimed at eliminating anti-personnel land mines which now
goes into effect in six months.
	   At a press conference, ambassadors from Canada, Austria, Norway,
South Africa and Burkina Faso _ countries that either drafted the
treaty or hosted negotiations on it _ congratulated one another for
their work.
	   The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999. The United Nations
made the announcement Wednesday after the West African nation of
Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact. The treaty
required ratification by 40 nations and their legislatures to go
into effect in those countries.
	   ``It is important ... that the 40th ratification comes from
Africa, which is now in so much suffering as a result of
anti-personnel mine infestation,'' Canadian Ambassador Robert
Fowler said.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles
of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory
within 10 years.
	   ``It is common knowledge that Africa is the continent afflicted
most by the scourge of anti-personnel land mines. Practically more
then one-third of all land mines can be found on the continent,''
said Pieter Vermeulen, a deputy ambassador from South Africa.
	   In London, British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said the
success in ratifying the treaty ``reflects the international
community's determination to rid the world of anti-personnel mines,
and sends a clear signal to those who have not signed.
	   ```Our task now is to persuade those countries to sign without
further delay, and to remove the millions of mines already laid
across the world.''
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty,
maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are
also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians. The mines have also rendered huge
swaths of productive land unusable.
	   Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and
its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122
countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve
the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come
up with an alternative weapon by then. The Pentagon has requested
dlrs 4.7 million in the fiscal 1999 budget for the program.
	   One possibility is a weapon that would temporarily disable an
approaching enemy, but not kill. Another involves sensors that warn
of a foe's approach and then trigger weapons.
	   In a statement, the ICBL expressed ``grave concern about reports
of the continued laying of mines in a number of countries that have
signed but not ratified the treaty, such as Angola, Cambodia,
Senegal and Sudan.
	   The ICBL also condemned the use of mines in non-signatory states
such as Yugoslavia, where Serb forces have reportedly planted mines
along the border of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and Albania to
discourage arms smuggling.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a
statement saying ``real success will be measured in terms of fewer
victims, the replanting of fertile farmland and the resumption of
normal life in communities plagued by landmines.''
