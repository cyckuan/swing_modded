	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Military representatives of 33 countries
as well as non-governmental organizations opened a four-day
conference Tuesday aimed eliminating land mines throughout Europe.
	   The conference, organized by the Austrian defense ministry, the
Italian armed forces and the West European Union, is to improve
cooperation in mine detection and destruction.
	   ``The seminar is a sign of a new era in cooperation in the
fields of disarmament and humanitarian assistance,'' Austrian Gen.
Karl Majecen told the conference during opening ceremonies.
	   Austrian mine clearing experts are working with their
counterparts from other countries in detecting and destroying
landmines in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Golan Heights between Syria
and Israel.
	   The conference is expected to include discussions on ways to
compile information and databanks on non-standard landmines, making
them easier to disarm safely.
	   Majecen said it was time for European countries to coordinate
their activities and share information in landmine technology and
ways to detect and disarm them
	   During his speech, Italian Defense Minister Massimo Brutti
praised efforts by Europe and international organizations to remove
``these instruments of death.''
	   Brutti said Italy had already taken steps to comply with the
1997 Ottawa Treaty which bans the production, storage and use of
such weapons.
	   The United States refused to sign the treaty because it wants to
maintain landmines in the demilitarized zone separating North and
South Korea. The Pentagon also wants to exempt anti-personnel mines
designed to deter tampering with larger anti-tank mines not covered
by the treaty.
	   Washington is also lobbying NATO countries to allow the
stockpiling of anti-personnel mines until the year 2003. Critics
accuse the Americans of trying to undermine the treaty among their
European allies.
