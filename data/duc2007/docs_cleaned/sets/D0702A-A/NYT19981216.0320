As a young girl in Trinidad, Cynthia Leveine used to peek from her windows to catch a glimpse of the steel bands, defying her parents, who forbade her to listen to the popular street music that was tapped out on refurbished 55-gallon metal drums.
``You dared not ask about it,'' said Ms. Leveine, who is now in her 50s and lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.
``It was the music for the people who lived on the other side of the tracks.''
But Ms. Leveine, who immigrated to New York 30 years ago, vowed that her children would not only listen to the soothing sound; they would also learn to play the steel drum, or pan, as it is commonly called.
And to her joy, Ms. Leveine's 22-year-old daughter, Jacquii, a music major at City College, has been playing the steel drum for nearly a decade.
The drumming of Jacquii Leveine is part of a rising sound of the pan in those New York City neighborhoods transformed by the large influx of Caribbean immigrants.
Reflecting a growing appreciation for steel drums in the Caribbean and around the world, the drum has even taken a place next to the trumpet and clarinet as a musical option for students at some city schools.
Its popularity has been increased immeasurably by the annual West Indian American Day Carnival, the sprawling pageant that showcases the artistry of the steel drum.
This is all a bit of a passage for the pan, which was once burdened by its image as an instrument of rabble-rousers an image promoted earlier this century by Trinidad's British rulers, who saw the music as a magnet for subversive gatherings.
``This is the way the world turns,'' said the elder Ms. Leveine.
``Parents are realizing the value of the instrument.
Music is music no matter how and who plays it.''
In Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, many public schools now offer steel drum classes as part of their music education programs, and professional pan players who migrated from Trinidad and other islands are offering private lessons.
Many bands that take part in the Carnival celebration are also conducting classes for teen-agers.
The instruments, which were once fashioned crudely out of used oil drums, are now custom-made at several storefronts in Brooklyn where entrepreneurs make a living carving, tuning and painting drums for sale.
They sell for about $500 to $900, said William Jones, a steel drum aficionado from Brooklyn.
Teen-agers, who now form the core of many steel bands in Brooklyn, hold jam sessions in so-called pan yards, a term borrowed from the outdoor sites where steel drums are played in the Caribbean.
They are drawn to the pan yards by camaraderie and by the sound of the drums.
``To me it's like another language,'' said Horace Moore, 17, of East Flatbush, who was at a steel drum jam session on a recent night at the St. Francis of Assisi Church on the edge of Crown Heights in Brooklyn.
``At its highest, the steel drum has a crisp, straight sound with no aftereffect.''
Nicole McCarthy, 17, who was playing a double drum set nearby, chimed in: ``It's really soothing.
It's like you're in this groove and you're making a sound unlike anything we're used to here.''
Ms. McCarthy's friend Sandra Thompson, 17, pointed to Ms. McCarthy and said: ``I started playing because of her.
So now I'm into it.''
The steel drum is trimmed with chisels and tuned with sledge hammers.
It produces muted, bell-like tones.
As a solo instrument, the steel drum does not compare well with some other instruments like the guitar.
But in an orchestra, it produces a full, melodic sound.
The instrument was assailed by the British colonials, who ruled Trinidad from 1797 to 1962, as a tool for popular uprising and banned its playing.
The British view of steel drums took hold in the upper reaches of Trinidad's society.
By 1967, however, the drum's stigma had begun to lift.
Now the steel drum, which carries the full chromatic range of notes and produces just about any type of music from classical to calypso, has become as much an icon of the region as a swaying palm.
There are more than 200 professional steel bands throughout Trinidad, and steel drum is taught side by side with mathematics and science in most schools.
Nearly every school has a steel band.
``Steel pan is a natural art form,'' said William Jones, founder and executive director of the Caribbean American Sports and Cultural Youth Movement, which runs one of the largest steel bands in New York, a perennial winner of the Carnival's band contest.
``It comes out of the black poor of the island.
It is spontaneous and at the same time formal.''
The excitement of the instrument is also drawing non-Caribbean, particularly black American, youngsters looking for a different music than the blues, jazz or hip-hop that dominate their musical environment.
It's a delicate instrument; you have to hit the notes just right.''
Steel drum has gained momentum in the city's public schools, which received $25 million last September from the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to restore arts and music programs that were cut several years ago.
Schools like George W. Wingate High School in Brooklyn have used some of the money to buy more steel drums and to expand steel drum classes.
Ed Morgano, the school board's director of arts education for Brooklyn, said that having steel drum classes helps ease the transition for newly arrived Caribbean students.
At the same time, it opens American-born students to something different.
