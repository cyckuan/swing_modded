Veteran musician John Mellencamp was on hand for a ceremony designed to help rookies start playing.
Before a Wednesday night concert, Mellencamp and officials with the Save the Music Foundation announced the donation of $75,000 worth of musical instruments to three Detroit schools.
The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about the importance of music education.
``I'm very excited about it,'' said Charles Moody, the principal of Bethune Elementary School in Pontiac, one of the three schools.
``We know the impact that music has on a child's development.''
