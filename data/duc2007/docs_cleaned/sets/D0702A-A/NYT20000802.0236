In academia, the battle lines are drawn, and the next salvo in the Mozart wars is about to be fired.
Researchers are mustering data to counter those who are intent on debunking the ``Mozart effect'' the theory that classical music makes the brain work better and they have some high-profile allies.
President Clinton and the musician Billy Joel, for example, spoke in June at a school in New York City's East Harlem that received a donation of $5 million in musical instruments from VH1 Save the Music Foundation, in support of the notion that musical education can provide a powerful intellectual stimulus.
Levy, the chancellor of New York City's public schools, surprised 43 school superintendents by arranging for them to take a group violin lesson from Isaac Stern.
They say that music sharpens children's concentration and makes them brighter and livelier.
If music's beauty and mystery fail to impress cost-conscious school boards, the thinking goes, then proving its ancillary benefits might save music programs from the budgetary ax wielded by those who regard music as an expensive luxury unrelated to reading, writing and `rithmetic.
To help determine who is right, an array of scientists is studying how music works in the brain.
The researchers have analyzed babies' responses to lullabies, as well as their awareness of pitch and rhythm, showing, in some studies, that infants experience music much as adults do.
We arrive ready to join the band, the scientists say, but too often the instruments have been packed away by schools that no longer use them.
According to the report, written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive psychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed by Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, something happens to young children when they are given keyboard lessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts, and for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on spatial reasoning tests improves.
That observation was the genesis of the term ``Mozart effect,'' which has been trademarked by the musician and author Don Campbell, although his new book, ``The Mozart Effect For Children,'' to be published in September by William Morrow, is unrelated to the study that started the debate.
In the original 1993 study, Gordon L. Shaw and Frances H. Rauscher showed that a small group of college students performed better on certain spatial-reasoning tests after listening to a Mozart sonata.
The so-called ``effect'' an increased ability to ``see'' the design of a snowflake, for example, after mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper, or to rotate and compare objects conceptually in space lasted only 10 to 15 minutes, but the news was treated like a formula to get smart quick.
Classical music seemed like the latest mega-vitamin: a little hard to swallow, but so good for you.
The theory, which made the rounds of magazines in cover stories, quickly found its biggest audience in the conscientious parents of young children and to the parents of children-to-be, who hurried to buy specially packaged music CDs so they could play Pachelbel's Canon to their babies in utero.
