President Clinton said Friday that ''it was tragic'' that school music programs frequently are the easiest target when budget-minded administrators have to cut education costs.
''I've been very disturbed'' about the problem, the president said.
''Over the last 20 years, more and more as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs.''
He spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show in tandem with the ''Save the Music'' fund-raising drive by music channel VH1 to preserve music programs in schools across America.
By some estimates, only 25 percent of American schools offer music programs as a basic part of the curriculum.
The interview was broadcast from a public elementary school in East Harlem.
Later, the president was visiting an elementary school in Queens to underscore the need for new school construction and repairs.
The president, a saxophone player who played in his high school band, has long championed the cause of preserving music programs in schools.
He said he volunteered to get involved when he heard about the VH1 program.
''We know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education,'' Clinton said.
''Not everyone learns in the same way, not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way.
And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance.''
Clinton said the federal government should do more to ease the financial strain on schools by providing more money to hire new teachers and build more classrooms.
But he said it was important that parents raise their voices and demand music programs for their children.
''One of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just took the music programs for granted,'' Clinton said.
And it was tragic, what happened.''
He continued, ''You'll see a big infusion of public money going back into these programs because of what VH1 has done and because more and more parents will insist on the music being there.
And I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help.''
Clinton was up early for the interview after spending the night at his home in Chappaqua.
As part of his New York visit, he was to speak at an evening fund raiser for Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.
The president was scheduled to stay in New York Friday night and return home on Saturday.
