philanthropic foundation wants to reassert the value of the arts and culture in the United States by spending $50 million over the next five years to arts causes.
The goal of Pew Charitable Trust is to give money to support arts financing, zoning in historic areas and arts curriculum for public schools, said Stephen K. Urice, who will direct the Pew initiative.
``What this is about is the long-term health of American creativity and the sustainability of American arts and culture,'' he said.
``The long-term goal is to strengthen both political and economic support for nonprofit culture.''
The $4.7 billion Pew foundation, started by the family owners of the Sun Oil Co., says it plans to establish a centralized information center for reliable data on all aspects of cultural life.
It intends to push greater media coverage, in hopes of promoting discussions among policy makers.
Pew will collaborate with museums and other arts institutions to build their cultural programs.
