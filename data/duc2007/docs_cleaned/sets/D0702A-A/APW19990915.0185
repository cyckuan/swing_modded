The two public university systems in the nation's most populous state have agreed to require the same high school course work for admission.
The two systems have different mandates.
The more prestigious University of California schools consider only the top one-eighth of the state's high school seniors, while California State University, dubbed the ``people's university,'' takes the top one-third.
The systems also have had slightly different class requirements for admission.
That often has forced students to choose which standards to satisfy or has made them take extra courses to meet both.
Under the new requirements, incoming CSU freshmen will be required to have an extra year of high school laboratory science and another of social science; UC will require a year of art, dance or music classes.
CSU's governing board unanimously approved the new plan on Wednesday.
The University of California regents approved the guidelines in March.
The new requirements will begin with this year's crop of high school freshmen.
The standards apply to all students who apply, whether they are from California or outside the state.
The requirements include four years of English; three years of math; two years of social science; two years of lab science, two years of foreign language; one year of visual or performing arts and one year of electives.
