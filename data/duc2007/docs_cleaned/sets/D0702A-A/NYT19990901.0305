Mayner grew up in the '60s and was raised on rock 'n' roll, but she wholeheartedly believes that classical music is good for her kids in a variety of ways.
``I'm convinced there's something there I know it directly affects their behavior,'' she says.
``Classical music is very organized, and that structure whether it's fast or slow and relaxed affects their mood and how they act.''
For one thing, she says, when the music's on in the car, her kids begin to notice the outside world.
Jack starts a two-way conversation with her instead of issuing a series of ``I want'' or ``I need'' demands, she says.
And both children are drawn to the kitchen when Mayner turns on the classical music otherwise, she says, they tend to stay in their rooms.
But it's not just mood that Mayner, and many other parents, are concerned with.
She is one of thousands of Americans who believe in the ``Mozart effect,'' a theory that classical music can affect the learning capabilities of children 3 and younger.
The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect on anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose minds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.
Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of California-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in child development, bringing with it several popular parenting books and an onslaught of CDs all aimed at directing American parents toward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula for effective parenting.
But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or helpful?
This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the theory behind the Mozart effect.
The most well-known is Dr. John Bruer, president of St. Louis' McDonnell Foundation.
In ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' which will be published Sept. 9 by Free Press (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis has been placed on brain development in the first three years of life.
He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims that listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial reasoning skills.''
Kenneth Steele agrees.
Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even include young children they were performed on college students, who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and cutting a piece of paper.
This is, he says, hardly a measure of any sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern composer Philip Glass.
``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were published in July in ``Psychological Science.''
``These students were equivalent across the board; their performance was the same.''
However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the minority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.
Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical CDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart.''
Three of the 15 top-selling classical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the author whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon hardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe in the effect.
On the national level, Florida toddlers now listen to classical music in public schools by law.
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences handed out free CDs of classical Grammy winners this past spring.
For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.
Californian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical music helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.
``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for complex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of classical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep With Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide.
But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as people's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.
The whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to do something good for their children.
Parents who play their kids the music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that they're helping their child's development.
But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too, Steele says with a laugh.
It all comes down to the money.
Babies will always be born to proud, new parents who want to do what's best which means that classical albums for kids may be major cash cows.
``There's a lot of commercial interest here,'' Steele says.
