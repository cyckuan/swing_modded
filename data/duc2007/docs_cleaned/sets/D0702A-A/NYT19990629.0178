They applauded Philip Glass as if he were a rap star and greeted the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with a gasp of delighted recognition.
The Carnegie Hall audience the other day was composed of hundreds of students in grades four through six from schools around the city.
Most had participated in Carnegie Hall's Linkup music education program, and it showed.
Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being slashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the country.
But how much the students actually learned was measured largely through anecdotes until now.
Carnegie Hall tried to improve on this with help from Columbia University's Teachers College and Educational Testing Services.
Program administrators asked 6,000 students participating in the program to develop musical compositions at the beginning of the course and again at the end.
The students used commercially available glockenspiels and homemade thumb pianos, guitars made of cardboard, a set of three can drums, can shakers and trumpets made from garden hoses.
Using a complicated scoring formula, testers evaluated the differences between the two compositions.
The improvement was far from earthshaking, but evaluators concluded that it was ``significant'' given the modest length of the program, which ran for seven 45-minute sessions.
The final compositions showed small improvements in how students produced sounds and alternated instruments.
And in written responses to questions about composing, the students gave more detailed explanations of how they used the instruments to create action, character and mood.
Results of the study were released this month.
Linkup emphasizes basic music concepts and music's relationships to other academic subjects through classes, planning sessions for teachers and artists, and concerts in schools and neighborhoods.
This year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733 teachers at 176 schools in New York.
For the study, conducted in the 1996-97 school year, students working in groups of six were given a set of instruments and asked to write a piece of music that would illustrate a short story they were asked to read.
Then they were asked, after some instruction in how to use the instruments, to choose sounds that ``show'' characters, action and mood.
The students had 15 minutes to create and practice a piece that was a minute or two long.
Each group played its piece, which was recorded.
The exercise was repeated at the end of the program, and the compositions were taped again.
The students' efforts were evaluated for use of timbre, texture, portrayal of the text and overall effectiveness.
The students also responded to written questions on work sheets.
The study found that sixth graders made the greatest gains while fourth graders made the smallest.
The report hypothesized that older students had had more exposure to the concepts of text, timbre and texture.
Another hypothesis was that the curriculum was more appropriate for older students.
Overall, students showed the most improvement in their use of texture and the smallest gain in their exploration of timbre.
Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, whose theories of multiple intelligences have gained wide popularity, said that the study sounded like a positive step but that follow-up was needed.
It is important to determine whether the students continue to improve, after such a short program, and at what rate, Gardner said.
``That you can do something in a short time is worth noting,'' he added.
``It's a good message to kids that this is something you can get better at.''
