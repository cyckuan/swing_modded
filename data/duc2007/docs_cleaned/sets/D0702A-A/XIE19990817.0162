Primary and middle schools across China will be equipped with more and better educational instruments as part of the drive toward higher-quality education.
Linguistic labs, computer labs, and specialized classrooms for other practical skills will be created in these schools, along with libraries and facilities for music, the arts, and physical education.
The Ministry of Education has required localities to further increase investment in educational technologies, and to guarantee that the investment grows annually.
The bulk buying of educational equipment in areas where conditions are ripe should be done by public bidding, in order to set up a sound operational and monitoring system.
The Ministry also has asked localities to map out plans for modern educational technology outfitting and to strengthen administration.
Computers, the Internet, and multi-media education have become standard components of school life for many primary and middle school students in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
Students in poorer areas, however, may still be doing their homework bending over an earthen bed in the dim light of a kerosene lamp.
