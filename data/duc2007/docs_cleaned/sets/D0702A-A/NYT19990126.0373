But he didn't have a clue about how to get from singing around the house to the cover of a compact disc until Tuesday.
Taylor was one of 700 students from 21 metro high schools who got a crash course in how to break into the music business at Grammy in the Schools, a daylong seminar sponsored by the Atlanta chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (the folks who bring us the Grammys).
Students, chosen by teachers and counselors for their interest in music, got to hear from some of the city's top industry insiders, such as producer Rico Wade (Outkast, Goodie Mob), engineer Phil Tan (Usher, Mariah Carey, TLC, Jermaine Dupri) and video producer Fred Taylor (``The Dip'').
The hard-work message was fairly consistent: ``You can't just buy a keyboard and make money; you may have to cut some grass,'' advised Wade.
But panelists also helped students understand what the word business means when it comes to making music.
As students realized they were brushing shoulders with heavy hitters, hands shot up throughout the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
``How do I copyright a song I've written?''
``Why does a musician need an attorney?''
Students also were able to attend sessions on songwriting, composition, artist management, interactive media, entertainment law, publishing and public relations.
With his black cashmere coat, shaved head and cast of famous friends, Wade captured most of the attention, which seemed to be a bit of a deja vu experience for the hot young producer.
``It's inspiring to look out there and see these kids, because they look just like me,'' he said, recalling his childhood as an aspiring musician in southwest Atlanta.
``They are imagining and dreaming, just like I was when I was that age.
It makes me feel like I have a purpose in life.''
Wade also ended up giving Bryan, the sophomore from Tri-Cities, the tryout of his life.
``Can you sing?''
Bryan shouted back yeah, grabbed a microphone and belted out Jagged Edge's ``I Got to Be'' as students gave him a roaring response.
``I've never sung in public before,'' Bryan said after the session.
``But I've learned that it's not just the singing.
You've got to work and get an education too.''
