Early next year, under the leadership of David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport since 1994, a new program will bring classical music to the 600 students in the town's single public school.
Kapell's support for classical music comes not just from his belief in the value of the arts but also from his personal history.
He is the son of the pianist William Kapell, who died in a plane crash in 1953 when he was just 31 and at the peak of acclaim.
At the time, David Kapell was 4.
Kapell's mission has been aided by another Greenport resident, John Serkin, also the son of a famous pianist.
Serkin, the third of Rudolf Serkin's six children and a onetime French horn player, is now a piano technician and tuner and serves on the village's Arts and Culture Committee.
He was instrumental in working out the details of the new arts program, which will bring students from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to classrooms in Greenport, where they will discuss and perform music.
Rudolf Serkin, who died in 1991, was a longtime director of the Curtis Institute.
To raise money for the program, Serkin has solicited the help of his younger brother, the pianist Peter Serkin, who is to play a benefit recital on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Greenport School Auditorium.
Serkin will perform on a grand piano provided by Steinway Sons in Manhattan.
With this gesture, the company is both supporting the educational initiative and honoring the memory of two major pianists who were exclusive Steinway artists.
The piano, valued at $50,000, is essentially being lent to the school, though the term the company prefers is ``long-term placement.''
It will be moved to the auditorium for Serkin's recital but will be kept permanently in a new wing of the village's Floyd Memorial Library, where the Curtis students will present concerts in conjunction with their work in the classrooms.
``We couldn't be more grateful,'' Kapell said recently, speaking of the contributions from the Steinway company and Peter Serkin.
``The arts program in Greenport has been minimal, if anything.
Our kids were missing cultural expansion, which is a shame.''
The benefit recital should generate enough money to support the music program for a full three years, John Serkin said.
The program has two goals: nurturing aspiring musicians and developing appreciation and audiences for the arts.
The response, Kapell said, is ``really surprising'' and ``very encouraging.''
The hall, which seats more than 700, is sold out for Sunday's concert, and the waiting list for tickets is approaching 100.
``It's overwhelmingly local people who are coming, people who live within 10 miles of the village,'' Kapell said.
And, thanks to benefactors who contributed $500 each, at least 150 seats will be occupied free by students from nearby school districts.
The mayor described Greenport as a ``true blue-collar town, fundamentally,'' though this ``belies the broader demographics'' of the area and its small, stable and diverse economy.
Local industries include fishing, wineries, retail and tourism.
While the population of the incorporated village is 2,100, the school serves a district of 5,000 residents.
John Serkin has been tuning the piano and voicing it (adjusting the density of the felt hammerheads for sound quality) in preparation for his brother's recital.
In choosing the works he will play, Peter Serkin has devised a substantive and varied program, including shorter pieces by Chopin, Debussy and Messiaen; recent works by Gyorgy Kurtag and George Benjamin; Schoenberg's Piano Suite, Op.
(a challenging 12-tone work that Serkin plays vibrantly), and, in the second half, Mozart's Sonata K. 332 and Beethoven's ``Les Adieu'' Sonata.
``We can't wait,'' the mayor said.
``The students are excited.
You never know where the next great musician is going to come from.
It could be Greenport.''
