Merchant Street is a tattered row of produce warehouses and auto body shops, its littered sidewalks and cracked street home to the poor and to drug addicts.
This is not a pretty part of town, but here in the heart of what is known as skid row is a jewel.
At the back of an asphalt parking lot, in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters, a door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard.
Youngsters often clean their paintbrushes under the spray.
Running almost the length of the courtyard is the glass front facade of a large, bow-trussed building.
On any given day, a circle of children sits inside, absorbed in painting self-portraits.
This is Inner City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where education is embellished by architectural example.
Inner City Arts, founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and English language instruction to students from public elementary schools largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing industries.
The school was founded by Bob Bates, an artist and teacher, and Irwin Jaeger, a Beverly Hills real estate investor who decided there had to be more to life, as he put it, ``than working, taking vacations and going to charity dinners.''
Their aim was to fill a void in arts education created by Proposition 13, a property tax cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California voters that slashed financing for public services and schools.
In the year following the passage, said Beth Tishler, the school's executive director, virtually ``all arts curriculum was eliminated from the public schools.''
There are now more than 200 nonprofit arts programs in Los Angeles, many considered excellent, but Inner City Arts is rare in that it boasts, in its converted 8,000-square-foot auto body shop, an inspiring home, where the architecture elevates the social and arts-education experiences.
The building, officially called the Mark Taper Center/Inner City Arts, was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture, in collaboration with Marmol Radziner Architecture and Construction.
Maltzan, a protege of Frank Gehry and the project architect on the Disney Concert Hall planned for downtown Los Angeles, said that he felt compelled ``to do something'' after the city's 1992 riots and that he did the work pro bono.
``To see it rip itself apart was devastating.''
At the school, what the architects accomplished is a building that is expansive, airy with light pouring in through its vast window wall and bold in its sculptural forms.
The plan, described by Maltzan as ``a village of objects'' around a central courtyard, affords views from one area to another ``limitless horizons,'' Maltzan says as well as flexibility: spaces are constantly used in different ways.
The design is also an object lesson in construction.
Children study the raw surfaces the unadorned brick walls, the timber frame partly clad in plasterboard, the exposed trusses, the industrial roll-up garage doors.
They draw inspiration for their own drawings and paintings from the strong, simple shapes.
``Kids use the building as material for some of their art projects,'' Ms. Tishler said.
``They talk about how the building was put together, the ways in which they contribute to the changing and molding of the building.''
Many children live in lamentable conditions in apartments for transients or in housing projects.
Nick Estrada, 18, a former pupil and now a volunteer there, said, ``Inner City Arts is my home.''
Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools who attend classes twice a week for six weeks.
More schools are clamoring to be included.
In 1994, the school moved from two temporary bungalows to its current premises, at 720 South Kohler Street (one entrance is off Merchant Street).
It has bought two adjacent industrial buildings and intends to triple in size, with plans that include animation studios.
The school now backed by an impressive list of donors, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mark Taper Foundation, which supports, among other things, social services and the arts has a unique relationship with the Los Angeles Unified School District.
The district provides transportation and security and has helped the school create a program for teaching English through art.
``This private-public partnership is a national model,'' said Leticia Quezada, a past president of the Los Angeles Board of Education.
``The quality of the arts experience the children are receiving is phenomenal, 400 percent better than it would be in the school classroom.
There's a sense of confidence in the arts experience those children are getting, and we want to see it extended to other schools.''
