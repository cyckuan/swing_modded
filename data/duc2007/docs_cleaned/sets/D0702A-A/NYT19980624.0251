Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts education have begun to change.
Buoyed by a revived economy, California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put education on the front burner.
And arts education has crept back onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment industry.
``There's great demand for talented visual artists, but unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the U.S.,'' said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools.
And last March the Los Angeles school district passed stringent graduation requirements citywide in visual arts, music, theater and dance, for kindergarten through grade 12.
``The hard part now is the implementation,'' said Don Dustin, the district's director of visual and performing arts.
``We do not have the resources, the background, the personnel.''
Inner City Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, does.
After the construction of Inner City Arts, Maltzan designed a new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood.
It is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and art gallery.
Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a much-used communal plaza.
Enrollment in art classes has increased since the recent opening.
While Inner City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less likely to be an architectural one.
Because many public schools are struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned, concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a priority.
Even at Inner City Arts and Harvard-Westlake, Maltzan initially faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture.
At Inner City Arts, he said, ``they were used to living off donated paper.''
At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers paramount and architecture as enclosure.
``In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees,'' said Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, ``architecture implies added expense.
It's not until someone catches the contagion of creativity and inspiration of architecture that one appreciates what it can do.''
At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools.
Perhaps architecture will follow.
