Every weekend, students in Zhengzhou can take in a free concert, a traditional Chinese opera or a stage play in the city's Youth and Children's Palace, as part of a project to improve the younger generation's education in the arts.
The project was launched by the city government three months ago for students in local colleges, middle and primary schools.
Zhengzhou is the capital city of central China's Henan Province.
One concert featured the Henan Philharmonic Orchestra playing works by Beethoven, Chopin and Bizet.
During the evening, the young listeners were told how the different instruments work, given information about each composer and taught how to appreciate a symphony.
The sponsors of these activities hope that by providing young people access to classical music and opera, and dramatic works, they will turn away from the influence of vulgar art performances.
The "music and drama" weekends have also helped nurture civilized manners and moral conduct in young people, sources said.
