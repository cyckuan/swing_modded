Mayor Paul Schell rode into office as the arts mayor, heavily backed by the city's arts groups.
In a press conference Tuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of proposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the arts.
Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts Commission.
Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly created job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks Department, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of Sandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park on Sandpoint Way N.E.
The new space could house low-cost artist studios as well as performing arts spaces.
Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for arts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the One Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5 Percent for Art.
In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program, because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside but owned by the city.
The additional money will go not just to visual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.
The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete proposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens.
He has a new slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody.''
These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller performance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat theater on the site.
On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be what the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also available to arts groups seeking performance venues.
Such groups will also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and Industry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.
The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple arts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to the city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to the one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate Council for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts groups.
Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a so-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and empower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts identities.
The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal point for information about the city's arts programs.
Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of the Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.
The 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who made up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council member Nick Licata nine months ago.
Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task force's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were pleased by the mayor's annoucements.
Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was heartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial first step.
Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts Commission.
In the meantime, the task force recommended that the city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts commission, and that the commission become a city department: the city's centralized art source.
Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed the other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for the arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but it's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized in the arts commission.
He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission but through community parks, libraries, community centers and the Neighborhood Matching Funds.
Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.
Schell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give citizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.
Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts, says the library is already providing art access information, but not enough people know about it.
``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows about it, what difference does it make?''
Arts information is also available through the library online: spl.org.
In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition spaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music ensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video equipment available as needed.
Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle Arts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts Commission-funded artists and arts organizations.
Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint, Schell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct. 29.
On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that however modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are specific.
``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said.
``The city's commitment to arts was stalled.
The mayor is laying out where he plans to make his mark.
Some of his ideas are quite bold, like the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''
