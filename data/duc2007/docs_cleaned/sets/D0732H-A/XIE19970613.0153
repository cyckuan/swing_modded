The annual gross enrollment in Kenya's primary schools fell by two percent to 55 percent this year mainly due to the introduction of cost-sharing in schools, which has locked out children from poor background.
Moreover, 23 percent of the pupils enrolled in the country's 16,000 primary schools dropped out before reaching grade five between 1990 and 1995, according to a lastest Human Development Report.
The decline was also a result of lack of adequate teaching facilities and qualified teachers in many schools in the eastern African country, the local press quoted the report as saying today.
The requirement that children must go to school in uniform, buy a variety of textbooks and pay numerous levies and fees have also contributed to the drop in school enrollment, said the report.
However, Kenya's adult illiteracy rate was sharply down to 21.9 percent in 1995 from about 35 percent in previous years, said the report.
Earlier, Kenyan Education Director Sammy Kyungu said the government has drafted guidelines to liberalize the education sector in the next century.
Under the guidelines, procurement of textbooks, supply and distribution would be school-based rather than dependent on the Kenya Institute of Education, he said on Thursday.
