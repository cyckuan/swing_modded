The talks on teachers' pay dispute between the Kenyan government and the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) has reached a deadlock, the Daily Nation reported today.
The paper said that the teachers' union vowed to continue with the four-day-long strike until the Kenyan government meets its demands.
The government issued a statement last night, advising all teachers who started a nationwide strike on October 1 to report to their duty stations by 8 a.m. tomorrow or face unspecified punishment.
The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho was issued when the talks aimed at ending the strike was going on under the chairmanship of Labour Minister Philip Masinde.
After learning this development, John Katumanga, Chairman of the Teachers Service Commission said that "it is unfair, immoral and against all known labour laws to make prejudicial statements when the talks were going on."
The striking teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent, but the government has agreed to give a 10 to 28 percent salary increment.
The KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo noted that "we went to the talks with an open mind" and prepared a proposal of spreading the salary increase over a three-year period.
However, he stressed, the Kenyan government has not offered anything new to the teachers at the talks and kept on saying there is no money.
Sources here said that the talks had to be adjourned to facilitate "further consultations at the political level" and to "give the parties time to see whether all grounds were acceptable to them."
