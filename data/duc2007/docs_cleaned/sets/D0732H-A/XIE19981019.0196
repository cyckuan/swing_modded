The World Bank has decided to issue a 1.6-billion-Shilling (26.66 million U.S.
Dollars) grant to help Kenya develop early childhood education in the next three years.
The program aims to improve pre-school teacher performance, and enhance community capacity building and mobilization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education monitoring and evaluation.
World Bank's intervention has been necessitated by a strong need for well-trained pre-school teachers in this east African country, said Marito.
This has also been necessitated by the need to harmonize pre-school education programs to accord near uniform pre-school to primary school transition, he said.
Currently, the sub-sector has a teaching force of 36,129.
Out of them, only 16,500 are fully trained.
According to the data from the Kenyan Ministry of Education and Human Resources, the enrollment rose to the current 1,064,053 pupils from 844,796 in 1980.
