Uganda has launched on Thursday a national strategy for girls' education, calling upon the government to scrutinize and harmonize its roles and activities in educating girl children.
Addressing the launching ceremony at the International Conference Center in Kampala, Vice-President Specioza Wandira Kazibwe said that one of the obstacles to girls' education is lack of physical facilities like laboratories especially in girls schools.
This has hindered girl students from excelling in science subjects, she added.
Kazibwe said the strategy of action for girls' education compels the government to establish a girls school that is well facilitated with a laboratory and a computer center in every district in the east African country so as to provide life skills to the girl child.
Of the 146 developing countries rated on the Gender Human Development Index, Uganda is relegated to 132nd place compared to Kenya's 112th and Tanzania's 123rd position.
At the primary level, it put girls' enrolment at 47 percent compared to 53 percent for boys, and it widens to 32 percent for females and 68 percent for males at the secondary level.
