About 240,000 teachers around Kenya will go on strike on October 1 if the government fails to meet their salary hike demands within 28 days, local press reported today.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) sent the strike threat to Minister for Labor and Manpower Development Philip Masinde Wednesday following a crisis meeting of the KNUT national executive council.
The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent as recommended by the remunerations committee, instead of 10-to-28 percent announced by Education Minister Joseph Kamotho Monday.
"The teachers have resolved that they will not accept anything sort of the full implementation of the recommendations" made by the committee, said KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo Wednesday.
According to the recommendations, the lowly paid teacher should get a minimum of 5,640 Shillings a month, with a top bar of 7,079 Shillings.
The highest paid teacher (chief principal) is to get a minimum of 42,240 Shillings, with a top bar of 52,246 Shillings.
Currently around 62 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar.
The remunerations committee also recommended automatic house allowance for all cadre of teachers, with the lowest being 4,700 Shillings a month up from 640 Shillings.
Others are motor vehicle, transfer, hardship, commuter and accommodation allowances.
In contrast, under the Kamotho's announcement, the lowest paid teacher will start at 2,405 Shillings a month, up from 1,880 Shillings.
The highest starts at 21,000 up from 19,115 Shillings, with a ceiling 25,840 Shillings.
The KNUT has described Kamotho's package as an insult to the teachers in charge of about seven million children in the country's primary and secondary schools.
Meanwhile, Kamotho argued that the government is unable to give the hefty pay rise and lucrative benefits the committee had recommended because of inadequate budgetary allocations.
