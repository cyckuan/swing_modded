Kenya's controversial 8-4-4 education system is to be replaced with a new school program by January 2001, according to a report submitted by the country's Education Commission of Inquiry.
The Daily Nation reported Friday that Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Thursday asked the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to appoint a task force to implement the proposals put forward by the commission.
Details about the report were not available, but the commission is believed to have called for changes to the 8-4-4 system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university.
The current system, introduced 14 years ago, has been widely criticized by parents and teachers for its heavy workload.
It is too broad, too expensive and too troublesome, they complained.
