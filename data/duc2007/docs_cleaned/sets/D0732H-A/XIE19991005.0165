The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has urged Kenya's Education Ministry to include sex education in the curriculum.
The UNICEF country representative Chrispin Wilson said Monday that it was essential to provide information about HIV/AIDS to the youth in order to curb the spread of the killer disease.
"Using schools as the means to reach children aged between five and 14 to induce behaviour change through HIV/AIDS education are some of the best methods to try to stop the spread of the virus," said Wilson.
Kenya will have about 850,000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000, according to Wilson.
The newly infected were young people in Kenya, where the HIV infection rate has reached 13 to 14 percent, said Wilson.
He observed that the age group most at risk was between 15 and 24 and girls aged between 15 and 19 were at a much higher risk of contracting the virus than boys.
Kenya's Catholic church leaders and some politicians are strongly against adolescent sex education citing it would mislead young people.
