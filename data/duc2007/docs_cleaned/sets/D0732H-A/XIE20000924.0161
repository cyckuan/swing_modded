The Kenyan government has published the University Bill 2000 to allow foreign universities to establish constituent campuses in the east African country, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka was quoted as saying here on Saturday that the bill will be submitted to the parliament for debate when it resumes next month.
Under the new bill, only foreign universities recognized in their mother countries will qualify to operate campuses in Kenya, he said.
According to the minister, foreign constituent colleges will save Kenyans much in school fees and foreign exchange.
"Kenya has the capacity for more universities," he said.
Musyoka also praised private universities in Kenya, saying they complement the government's efforts to provide higher education.
Earlier, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said the number of Kenyan students who want a university education has far outstripped the places at public universities and colossal amounts of money is spent each year on education abroad.
