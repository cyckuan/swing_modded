Kenya's Ministry of East African and Regional Cooperation has called for the harmonization of education in the east African region, including similar curricula and certification.
Permanent Secretary Samuel Ambuka said the move would help attain a state of singularity in the region's economic management and social organization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult.
"It brings in the problems of differences in the basic skills and knowledge a student ought to have to acquire at the various levels of education, and the question of assessment of points and credits in the three countries," he noted.
He suggested that the three east African nations set up joint teams to study curricula, examination and certification of primary, secondary and college education as a basis for harmonization of curricula and certification.
On Kenya's 8-4-4 curricula, Ambuka admitted that it emphasized a wide range of subjects at the expense of in-depth analysis.
