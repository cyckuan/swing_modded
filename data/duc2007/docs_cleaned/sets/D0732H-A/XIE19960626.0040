Kenya has a shortage of over 200 science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country, Kenyan Minister for Education Joseph Kamotho said today.
Kamotho said this when he presented a total of 300,000 Kenya Shillings (about 5,000 U.S.
Dollars) to schools in Mathioya Division of Muranga District.
The minister appealed to students to join state universities and learn science subjects especially physics and chemistry in order to bridge the gap.
He also announced that his ministry will soon increase salary of science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country as directed by President Daniel arap Moi so as to attract more teachers to the career.
Kamotho, who is also the ruling KANU secretary general, appealed to parents to join hands with the government and contribute to the development of schools in order to lay a firm foundation for their children.
