The General Assembly of African Women Educators Forum (AEF) will open in Nanyuki, 200 kilometers north of Nairobi, capital of Kenya on Tuesday.
AEF's 43 members from 26 countries and African education ministers are expected to attend the five-day meeting at Kenya's equatorial town.
In a statement, the AEF organizer said the AEF is to enhance political commitment towards the goal of "education for all" and urge government donors and non-governmental organizations to invest more in the education sector especially in the education of girls.
