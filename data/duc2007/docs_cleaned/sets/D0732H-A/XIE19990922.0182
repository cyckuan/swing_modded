The Kenya government is worried that the high drop-out rates in schools may frustrate its efforts to achieve education for all by 2050.
Daily Nation Newspaper Wednesday quoted a top education official as saying that more students have dropped out in the past decade despite a "substantial increase" in budgetary allocations.
Out of the pupils enrolled in Standard One, only 47 percent complete the primary education; out of these, only 17 percent survive to complete the secondary schooling, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Wilfred Kimalat said Tuesday.
He said that only seven percent of high-school graduates are lucky enough to go to public universities, which means that only 1.2 percent of those who begin the education cycle make it to university.
According to Kimalat, the education allocations have more than tripled over the past eight years.
