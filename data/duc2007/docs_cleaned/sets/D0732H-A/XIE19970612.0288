The Kenyan government has decided to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate a business culture among children in the eastern African country.
The new subject, Entrepreneurship Education, will focus on practical aspects of business management and industrial development, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho announced on Tuesday in a statement.
"The intention is to inculcate a business and enterprising culture in the minds of learners at an early age," he claimed.
However, it is just an additional one to the 13 subjects taught in primary schools and will be non-examinable.
The move is one of the eight strategies for training and human resource development in preparation for the country's industrialization, said Kamotho.
Other strategies include strengthening of educational and training programs for the disabled, ensuring street children get access to education and offering a second chance to drop-outs to improve their literacy and get short-time career training.
Training in the country's institutions would be harmonized with the labor market requirements to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand, he stressed.
