Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has challenged investors to consider investing in higher education in Kenya, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper said Saturday.
Addressing the United Nations International University in Nairobi Friday, Moi said out of some 30,000 students who qualify for university education in the country each year, less than 30 percent get admission to public universities.
He noted that another five percent of those get admission in private universities while the rest seek university education outside the country.
Presently, there are about 20,000 students studying abroad whose expenditure is estimated to be 16 billion shillings (214 million U.S. dollars) per year.
The president urged private university to take advantage of the quest for university education in Kenya by expanding their facilities in order to enroll more students.
He also mentioned that his government is in the process of revising the University Act of 1985 and the university rule of 1989 with a view of creating a more conducive environment for private sector involvement in higher education.
Moi said the academic programs offered by the country's institutions of higher learning should be market driven and called on private universities to diversify their programs to include basic and applied sciences.
