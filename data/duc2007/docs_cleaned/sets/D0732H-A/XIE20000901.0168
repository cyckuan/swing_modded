Kenya will launch sex education program in primary and secondary schools and teacher training colleges when schools reopen next Monday, with an initial 400 teachers trained for the exercise, local media reported Friday.
Officials at the Ministry of Education said the program is a product of joint efforts by local and international donors, anti- HIV/AIDS groups and the government through the National AIDS Control Council.
