Plans are underway to establish a regional apex body for a women's organization in East Africa, according to a news dispatch from Arusha, northern Tanzania.
This was disclosed by Magaga Alot, a senior member of the East African Commission at a gender workshop in Arusha on Tuesday.
Presenting a paper "Role of Women in the East African Cooperation (EAC)", Alot said when full fledged, the evisaged women's regional organization will among others, serve as a center for articulation, harmonization, and promoting of women's rights and roles within the framework of the EAC and regional integration.
Alot said that the apex body will also address issues such as women's participation in decision-making at all levels and access to social resources, including education, employment, health and population services.
He stressed, "Women account for roughly 50 percent of the combined population of the three (EAC) member states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania" and the EAC cannot ignore the plight or contribution of half of its human resource while pursuing regional integration and development.
Alot noted that what women need and deserve is nothing more and nothing less than the affirmation of their equal rights and opportunities under the law and in the society at large.
