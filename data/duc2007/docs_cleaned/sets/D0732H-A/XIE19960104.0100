Only 47 percent of the students who passed last year's Kenya Certificate of Primary Education Examination will have the opportunity to enter secondary schools, the Education Minister, Joseph Kamotho, has said.
Joseph Kamotho said out of the 401,649 candidates who sat the Primary Education Examination, only 189,187 have been selected to join secondary schools.
The other will miss the opportunity.
The minister made the remarks when he launched the national schools Form One selection exercise at Kenya Science Teachers College in Nairobi on Wednesday.
The intake number is an improvement of 0.8 percent over the previous year, he said.
Candidates selected to join secondary schools are expected to report between January 23 and February 9.
