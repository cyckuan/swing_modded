Al Gore took off for a week of hopscotching states with big primary jackpots Friday, picking up liberal endorsements on his way.
Bill Bradley camped in Washington state, trying to wrest primary voters from Republican John McCain as well Democrat Gore.
McCain has gained support from independents and Democrats in his primary battles with George W. Bush, and Bradley was trying hard to keep that from happening in Washington.
In campaign handouts and in his public remarks, Bradley was contrasting his record with McCain's on the environment, an important and emotional issue in the Northwest.
"McCain is a reformer and I'm a reformer," Bradley said.
"We both want campaign finance reform.
There's no question about it.
But when it comes to the environment there's a vast difference between John McCain and me."
He criticized McCain for calling a West Coast salmon project "pork barrel" spending, and he said he had an 84 percent vote rating from the League of Conservation Voters compared with McCain's 20 percent.
He didn't spare Gore, either, saying the vice president "never saw a dam he didn't like."
Bradley was endorsed by local environmental leaders as a champion of Pacific Northwest concerns such as pipeline safety, salmon restoration and prevention of oil tanker spills.
He was accompanied by Marlene Robinson, mother of Liam Wood, a teen-ager killed in a petroleum pipeline explosion in Bellingham.
Bradley's campaign strategy - ignore the delegate-rich states with March 7 primaries and hunker down for a symbolic victory in Washington's nonbinding Feb. 29 contest - confounded California-based Democratic consultant Bill Carrick.
He should be spending all his time here or New York," Carrick said.
Gore's smooth sail, buoyed by a growing lead in polls, was delayed only slightly Friday when the plane chartered for his campaign press entourage was grounded at Andrews Air Force Base because of hydraulic failure.
The vice president's Secret Service agents and military valets squeezed into the forward cabins on Air Force Two to make room for stranded reporters.
The mix of campaign and government showed up again when reporters were handed "Gore 2000" press releases bearing the stamp of the official fax machine in Gore's White House communications office.
One release trumpeted his endorsement by Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del.
Another promoted Gore's campaign stop at Cleveland's Eliza Bryant Center, the first senior citizens housing center in Cleveland to accept black residents.
There, Gore pushed his plan for a huge, open-ended expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
"I'll bet you know some people who sometimes take out their prescriptions, put 'em out on the table and try to figure out which one they can cut back on or cut out," Gore told about 75 senior citizens.
"Has anyone here ever done that?
Have you?"
Biden breakfasted privately with Gore before he left Washington.
The vice president also was being endorsed by Jerry Brown, the Oakland, Calif., mayor and three-time failed presidential candidate.
Brown was expected to appear with Gore - but not definitely so, aides cautioned - at an Oakland longshoreman's union hall very late on Friday night.
Both endorsements were expected to help dampen some of Bradley's most barbed criticisms of Gore - that he's a closet conservative who pays lip service to campaign finance reform.
Brown, who left the Democratic Party to be independent, made campaign finance a principal cause as a presidential candidate.
Gore also was endorsed Friday by Colorado Rep. Mark Udall, son of the late Mo Udall, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1976.
In the next week, Gore plans to visit Washington state, Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, New York and Massachusetts in addition to Friday's Ohio and California.
The latest New York poll released Friday showed Gore's lead widening among enrolled Democrats there but narrowing among those who definitely plan to vote in the state's March 7 Democratic primary.
The state's primary is considered a must for Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who once starred for the New York Knicks basketball team.
Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll found that among registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the 15-point lead the vice president held two weeks ago.
Among those Democrats who said they will definitely vote on March 7, Gore's lead slipped to 53-38, down from the 25-point margin he enjoyed earlier this month.
Still, it was a far cry from December, when the Marist poll showed Gore and Bradley in a statistical tie in the state.
"If I were Gore, I would be spending a lot more time in California and the Pacific Northwest" than in New York, veteran Democratic campaign consultant Hank Sheinkopf said.
