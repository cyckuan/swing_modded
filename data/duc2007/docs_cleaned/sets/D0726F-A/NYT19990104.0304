Jose Villarreal, the San Antonio lawyer serving as treasurer of Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, said Monday that he will work to make sure the Gore campaign's fund raising complies with the ``letter and spirit'' of the law.
Villarreal, a partner in the San Antonio office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer Feld, began his part-time duties as Gore's campaign treasurer on Jan. 1.
He said he will ``assemble the resources necessary to wage this campaign and do so in an expeditious manner.''
Villarreal said he will supervise Gore's fund raising ``in a manner that fully complies with both the letter and spirit of the law,'' adding: ``We'll make certain to do that.
As treasurer, I'll do everything within my power to insure that happens.''
Gore's fund raising in the 1996 re-election campaign of President Clinton came under scrutiny of Congress and the Justice Department.
Attorney General Janet Reno later cleared Gore of any wrong doing.
Villarreal, a graduate of Purdue University and the Indiana University school of law, served as deputy campaign manager for the 1988 Democratic presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov.
