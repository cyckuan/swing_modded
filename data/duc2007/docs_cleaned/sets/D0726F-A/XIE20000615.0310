Vice President Al Gore Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his presidential campaign.
Delay will resign from the present office on July 15 to replace Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who was hired by Gore a year ago to lead the campaign.
Daley, 51, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and brother of the city's current mayor, has extraordinary connections in the Democratic Party, and is considered a political insider with ties to both President Clinton and Gore.
Daley, who chaired the 1996 Democratic convention in his native city of Chicago, helped Clinton win the White House in 1992.
He recently led a successful campaign for the White House to win passage of a legislation granting permanent normal trade relations status to China by the U.S. House of Representatives.
After suffering stomach pains for three weeks, Coelho checked into hospital in Washington Monday night.
He called Gore Wednesday night with his resignation.
Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
