In what was billed as the capital's first presidential fund-raiser aimed at gays and lesbians, Tipper Gore scooped up more than $150,000 for her husband's campaign Thursday and promised contributors he would ``fight for your dreams.''
``All people, regardless of sexual orientation, should be able to be a part of a loving relationship in a family without fear of recrimination or discrimination,'' Mrs. Gore said.
Gore administration, she pledged, would ``stand against forces of hatred.''
Her husband, Vice President Al Gore, ``will fight for your dreams.
He will fight for OUR dreams,'' she added.
Mrs. Gore did not get into specifics of the gay policy agenda.
The wife of the vice president unflappably dealt with three AIDS demonstrators who, one by one, tried to disrupt her appearance among some 400 in a small hotel ballroom with cries of ``Gore's greed kills!''
The protesters, escorted out by Secret Service agents, accused Al Gore of siding with pharmaceutical companies in an international trade dispute and trying to block South Africa's access to cheap, generic AIDS drugs.
``We thought you might be here tonight,'' Mrs. Gore said.
Outside the hotel, nine activists affiliated with the group called ACT-UP carried signs calling Al Gore a ``drug company puppet'' and mocking his campaign as ``Apartheid 2000.''
Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political group, attended the reception as a ``gold level'' contributor to ``Gays and Lesbians for Gore.''
But he said he group's presidential endorsements were still a long way off.
``Solid and deep'' is how Birch described the vice president's record on matters important to the gay community.
Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, has voted the right way on gay issues but ``is not a stand-out,'' Birch said.
