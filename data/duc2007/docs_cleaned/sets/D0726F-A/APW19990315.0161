Vice President Al Gore, in a show of political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop in his onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis.
``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker of the House.
Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on winning both the House and White House in November 2000.
President Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents.
Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray.
Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign that catches fire at the grass roots.
He is buoyed by evidence of potential Gore weakness in the general election.
``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.
Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his boss.
The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New Hampshire news conference.
Gore said he will ``face entirely new challenges, and we need new answers.''
Yet his answers sounded familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all students and improve health care.
Clinton has pressed those ideas, but Gore promises to push them further.
``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally.
With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again: ``Stand with me!''
Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their hands high.
The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states that cast the earliest votes in 2000.
In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of inevitability about his nomination even before he formally announces his candidacy.
``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, said of Gephardt's endorsement.
``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the nominee.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is taking nothing for granted.
He promised to return to both states to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops.
During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov.
