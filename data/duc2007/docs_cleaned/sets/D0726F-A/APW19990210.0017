Vice President Al Gore appealed to black members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and return control of the House to Democrats.
He noted that a turnover of the House from Republican to Democratic control in the 2000 election would put blacks in key committee chairmanships.
The country needs ``more political maturity,'' not attempts to eliminate affirmative action programs, Gore told about 500 people at a dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus.
``We don't need more division in America,'' Gore said, adding that that his vision of the nation in the new millennium is that of a place ``committed to justice as well as prosperity.''
Gore already has formed committees for seeking the Democratic presidential nomination next year and named several key campaign officials.
Since the start of President Clinton's administration more blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal judges than ever before, he said.
Despite the achievements, too many are still without adequate health care or are forced to learn in crumbling, overcrowded schools buildings, he said.
Blacks also remain twice as likely to die at birth or from HIV/AIDS, or to be unemployed, he said.
