Vice President Al Gore, criticized for not having enough women in his inner circle, has hired a veteran female strategist to be his deputy campaign manager for his 2000 presidential bid.
Stacie Spector, deputy communications director at the White House, will move over to the Gore campaign to assist campaign manager Craig Smith and be director of strategic operations, campaign sources, asking not to be identified, said Thursday.
The job will make Spector, 35, the lead Gore aide over the campaign's operation that responds to accusations from opponents.
Spector was deputy communications director of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and was involved in several national political campaigns before that.
Gore has heard criticism from his own party, particularly from women's groups, about his inner circle, which has been dominated by men.
The appointment was to be announced Friday.
