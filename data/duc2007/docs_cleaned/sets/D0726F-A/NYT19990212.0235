Vice President Al Gore emerges from President Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue the embattled chief executive.
But the vice president's campaign for the White House faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish itself more effectively from Clinton on the hot-button issue of personal values.
Clinton, impeached by the House for perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to conceal his dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, was acquitted by the Senate on Friday.
``We've all condemned the president's personal conduct on an individual basis,'' said a prominent Democratic lawmaker who has been involved in national Democratic fund-raising efforts.
``But we need Gore to speak for all Democrats and make our stance more clear to help us reclaim the values issue.''
``They want us to start talking about their problems and their future.''
Gore issued a statement Friday welcoming Senate acquittal of Clinton and urging the nation to ``heal the wounds of this impeachment debate.''
Gore added: ``I know that President Clinton is eager to work across party lines on these and other challenges.
And I know that his leadership will continue to be good'' for the country.
Aides said Gore plans to gradually highlight differences with Clinton on policies and programs later this spring as he shifts into campaign mode.
``We're going to talk about what we're going to do and not about what we did,'' his campaign aide said.
Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist who has twice campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, says that Gore emerges from Clinton's impeachment fight as a formidable candidate.
``He's stronger because he has the absolute support of a strong president, a robust economy and has made no outstanding mistakes,'' Jackson said.
Jackson added in an interview on CNN that he may compete against Gore for the Democratic nomination in order to ``broaden the base of our party.''
Gore must ``earn the nomination, not inherit the nomination,'' Jackson said.
Thomas E. Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard, says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, owes his shot at the White House to Clinton, the Arkansas governor who defied conventional electoral strategy in 1992 by naming a fellow southerner to join a baby-boom ticket.
Gore was born in 1948, Clinton in 1946.
Gore underscored his loyalty to Clinton in the depths of the impeachment fight at a Democratic pep rally on the White House lawn on Dec. 19, hours after the House voted to impeach a president for first time in 131 years.
Clinton has ``acknowledged that what he did was wrong,'' Gore said, adding that the nation must also ``acknowledge that invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan politics is wrong.''
Gore then introduced Clinton as ``my friend, America's great president.''
Patterson said that Gore must now ``look for an opportunity to express unhappiness with the president's conduct'' sometime over the next month.
``You do it; you say you've done it; and you move on,'' Patterson said.
Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, the state planning to hold the nation's first presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
Gore ``scores a lot of points for loyalty to the president,'' Sullivan said.
Gore's fidelity and commitment to his family are so widely known that he doesn't need to highlight differences with Clinton on values, she said.
With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and to begin taking on potential Republican challengers such as Texas Gov.
