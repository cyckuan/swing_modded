Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., on Friday endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
Kennedy chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm of House Democrats.
He is the youngest son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and nephew of President Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy.
``Al Gore has always stood up for what's right for America,'' Kennedy said in a statement.
