Vice President Al Gore named a veteran of the Clinton-Gore presidential campaigns to be his campaign press secretary.
Catherine ``Kiki'' Moore, who worked for the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns, will fill the empty press secretary slot at Gore 2000 starting Sept. 7, campaign general chairman Tony Coelho said.
Gore has been making efforts to add women to prominent positions on his campaign team.
Deputy campaign chairman Marla Romash and pollster Celinda Lake were recent hires.
Since acting as spokeswoman for President Clinton's 1997 inaugural, Moore was a partner with the Dewey Square Group, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in grass-roots and communications strategies.
