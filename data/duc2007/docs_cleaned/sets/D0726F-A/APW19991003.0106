Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will stay on despite a government report that found questionable financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.
``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination.
``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, ``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball.''
The State Department's inspector general found potential improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996.
The job, with the United State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the fair.
The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000 from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's records.
The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is not paid, the inspector general said.
