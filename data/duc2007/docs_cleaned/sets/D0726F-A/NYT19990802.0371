Vice President Al Gore said Monday that his chief of staff, Ron Klain, was resigning to become a partner in the Washington office of O'Melveny Myers, a law firm based in Los Angeles.
Gore named Charles Burson, a longtime friend and counsel in his office and former attorney general of Tennessee, his new chief of staff.
Klain's departure had been expected for several weeks, since Gore named Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, general chairman of his presidential campaign.
There were reports of rifts between Coelho and Klain at the time, and some Democratic operatives expected Klain to be forced out.
But by the time of Monday's announcement, Klain and others were saying that Coelho was trying to get Klain to stay.
``Tony was doing everything humanly possible to try to get me to stay,'' Klain said in an interview.
But, he said, he had already decided it was time to leave.
``You reach a point in time when you need to do something else,'' Klain said.
``My heart said stay, but my head told me to move on.''
Campaign workers said he told them in a staff meeting that he was ``like a milk carton, and milk cartons have an expiration date.''
Friends said Klain had realized that ``the center of gravity had shifted'' from the vice president's office to the campaign.
Klain was criticized by some Gore allies after President Clinton called a reporter for The New York Times in May and said Gore needed to loosen up on the campaign trail.
Klain was in the room when the president decided to make the call.
He was blamed later for what was perceived as a public relations disaster for Gore, although others in the room had not objected either.
Klain said Monday that he and Coelho still thought the phone call was a good idea.
``Tony and I may be the only people in Washington who believe that phone call was a good idea,'' he said.
Klain, 37, will serve as a senior strategist to the campaign and will not leave for a few months, he said.
He was chief of staff for Attorney General Janet Reno before becoming Gore's chief of staff nearly four years ago.
