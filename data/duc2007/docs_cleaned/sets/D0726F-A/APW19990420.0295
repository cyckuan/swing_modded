Vice President Al Gore commiserated with those who lost their homes and businesses when a killer tornado tore through suburban Cincinnati earlier this month.
The vice president visited the areas worst hit when a pre-dawn twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow path through affluent subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other communities on April 9.
Four people died.
``I'm sorry for what you all have been through,'' Gore told Laurie Arshonsky, whose home in Montgomery was destroyed.
``You people have really suffered through a lot.''
Mrs. Arshonsky showed Gore a handful of jewelry and trinkets that she had recovered from the rubble of her home.
``What I'd like to do with my garden, I'd like to make it a tornado victory garden,'' she told him.
``Over the last several years, I have had the occasion to go to several different parts of our country to see the aftermath of disasters, and every one is unique and different,'' Gore said.
``But one comparison I would like to make is this: I don't know when I've heard more compliments in the aftermath for the response, the organization, the hard work, the long hours the way everybody has pulled together.''
``Those of you who lost family members and loved ones will be in our hearts and in our prayers,'' Gore said.
Insured damage has been put at $66 million by the Ohio Insurance Institute; the total uninsured damage has not been calculated.
