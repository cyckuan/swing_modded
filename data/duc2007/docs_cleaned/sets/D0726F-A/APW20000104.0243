Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide.
Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's nominating convention.
The decision to act now came after reflection over the Christmas holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's, according to people in the Kennedy camp.
Gore supporters had pushed for the endorsement.
Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, remains a liberal hero to many Democrats.
He sought the presidency himself in 1980 and has served in the Senate not only with both Gore and rival Democratic contender Bill Bradley but with the vice president's father, Al Gore Sr., in the 1960s.
Kennedy and Gore planned to appear at a Boston middle school to talk about education policy on Wednesday before driving north to Portsmouth, N.H., to discuss health care with senior citizens.
The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
In recent months, the vice president has seen his once sizable lead in the polls diminish in the face of a strong challenge from Bradley, the former New Jersey senator.
That has caused some Democrats to wish out loud that Kennedy would announce an endorsement.
The Kennedy camp said the endorsement should not be viewed as a slap against Bradley, who has unveiled a health care plan that Gore has criticized.
Bradley suggested the development only bolstered his contention that Gore, unlike him, is a Washington insider.
That is entrenched power,'' Bradley said.
It may also trigger other endorsements by the Massachusetts congressional delegation, which largely has held off endorsing in the primary.
The vice president, speaking with reporters after addressing students at the high school in this seacoast community, was clearly pleased by the development.
