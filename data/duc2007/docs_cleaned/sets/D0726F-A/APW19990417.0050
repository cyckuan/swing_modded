Recalling an uncle who suffered poison gas exposure in World War I, Vice President Al Gore said his family is ``one of millions that knows firsthand'' about the Balkans' role in world stability.
``Will the 21st century be shaped and molded by thugs in ski masks with weapons in their hands and hatred in their hearts?
The answer given by the people of the United States of America is no,'' Gore said Friday night at his first Tennessee fund-raiser for the 2000 presidential election.
``We saw midway through this century the moral consequences of crimes against humanity that occurred with much of the world standing by, not doing much of anything about it,'' Gore said.
Speaking to about 450 Democratic supporters gathered at a $1,000-per-plate dinner, Gore promised to get Kosovar refugees ``back to their homes, with security and with justice.''
Gore is expected to spend this weekend campaigning in New Hampshire.
Gore hasn't officially announced his campaign for the 2000 Democratic nomination, but has raised $8.9 million, according to the Federal Election Commission.
