Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of Tennessee.
"This is a hard, tough fight and I'm going to fight my heart out for every single vote."
The former Tennessee senator, who grew up in Washington, said he is taking his campaign "lock, stock and barrel" out of the nation's capital and to downtown Nashville in Tennessee State, where he will open his new headquarters in a week.
Gore's move is expected to cut his campaign staff, which Gore considered too big, too expensive and too slow to react.
Analysts said the move also will help distance Gore from President Bill Clinton, whose scandal-plagued administration has had a negative pull on the vice president's poll numbers.
Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
