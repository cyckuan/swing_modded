Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took his presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House.
Gore greeted about 70 people in the home of Democratic activist and former Mayor Martin Gross.
Gore stressed saving Medicare and Social Security, the environment, and education.
``No Democratic presidential candidate who has campaigned in this house has failed to get elected president at some point,'' Gross said.
Clinton visited the residence before placing a welcomed second in the 1992 state primary, and Carter came here before winning the 1976 primary.
Gore visited in 1988, when he failed to win the Democratic nomination, and now has a second chance, Gross said.
Gore addressed a forum on home health care in Portsmouth and spoke at a Democratic dinner in Conway on Friday.
He spent Saturday meeting with voters in homes in Concord, Manchester and Nashua.
During most of the trip, Gore did what his advisers have been wanting him to do: shed his stiff image and talk to people one-on-one.
``This is what he needs to do,'' said Bill Shaheen, his state campaign manager and Gov.
