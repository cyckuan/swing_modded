Healthy but still worried, thousands of people who took the fen-phen diet drug combination are seeking millions to pay for years of medical checkups in case they develop heart or lung problems.
Evidence linking the ``fen'' half of the drug duo with sometimes deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market in 1997.
Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against American Home Products, which made fenfluramine.
If American Home loses the civil trial, it could be forced to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade, one economist estimated in court documents.
``The implications are huge,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry analyst with HKS Co. in Warren, N.J. ``You're talking about as much as $1,000 per year per patient.
Then if you take the national implications ... you're looking at some serious problems for the company.''
The suit by New Jersey residents is the first class-action case against American Home to come to trial and the only one seeking payment for medical checkups rather than financial awards.
Madison, N.J.-based American Home already has settled several of about 3,100 individual suits, but those settlements are estimated to total only around $10 million.
During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton, Texas, on Wednesday, attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage.
Lovett, a 36-year-old manicurist, said she developed leaky heart valves after taking fenfluramine.
She is seeking unspecified damages in the case, now before the jury.
Nationwide, about 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine, which was sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical look-alike, dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux.
American Home pulled both drugs off pharmacy shelves in September 1997, several months after the first reports from the Mayo Clinic linking the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage in some patients.
The company insists there's no scientific proof that patients who stopped taking the drugs about two years ago and have no disease now will be injured in the future.
``We continue to believe that routine echocardiograms are not medically warranted for patients who have taken these drugs,'' said company lawyer Anita Hotchkiss.
Studies since the drugs were recalled generally indicate a slightly elevated risk of valve disorders, but that it appears to fade after patients stop taking them.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
