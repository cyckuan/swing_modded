Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home Products Corp., a lawyer confirmed today.
The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement meetings.
The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the negotiations today, said American Home Products would pay billions of dollars under such a deal.
Hill, however, said it was too early to put a price tag on a possible settlement.
``There have been several meetings, and a number of different proposals and scenarios have been discussed, but there are some difficult issues that are going to have to be agreed upon before anything of this magnitude can be concluded,'' Hill added.
American Home Products spokesman Lowell Weiner declined comment on the report this morning.
Last month, the company reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen, reportedly agreeing to pay $500,000 to one plaintiff.
Thousands of people contend they developed heart problems after taking the drugs.
Some 6 million people in the United States used the drug.
The company wants ``to avoid letting any of these cases go to trial and risk a really huge verdict,'' another Houston lawyer, Don Bowen, told the Morning News.
In 1997, the Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
Settlements in at least nine cases, including those of four Texans, have resulted in amounts of up to $4.6 million.
The company must put between $3 billion and $5 billion into a settlement before it is acceptable, some lawyers and Wall Street analysts told the Morning News.
The drug maker, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stated it was aware of 2,615 lawsuits over fen-phen as of March 22.
Class-action lawsuits are certified in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.
