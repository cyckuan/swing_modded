The nation's first fen-phen wrongful death trial ended in Harris County state district court Tuesday with a reported settlement of $6 million to $7 million, and most jurors said afterward they would not have awarded the plaintiffs any money at all.
``We feel we did the best we could for the kids,'' said Sandra Stom of Friendswood, Texas, whose daughter Mary Marisa Smith, 35, died in September 1997 of complications from a rare lung disease, allegedly caused by the ``fen'' part of the diet drug combination.
Stom was referring to Smith's children, 9 and 4 years old.
Other plaintiffs were Smith's husband, Michael, and father, Michael Stom.
Attorneys involved would not discuss the settlement, which is supposed to be confidential.
Lawyers said two other Harris County fen-phen cases, which did not involve deaths, also settled for confidential amounts Tuesday.
The Smith case was closely watched because it could shed light on whether juries will blame American Home Products of Madison, N.J., for contributing to the death or injury of fen-phen patients.
About 6 million people took one form of the two types of fen drugs the company sold.
The company said in March that more than 2,600 suits had been filed nationwide.
More than 600 have been filed so far in Harris County.
American Home is accused of deliberately downplaying the risks of the two fen drugs, both of which were removed from the market in September 1997 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after they were linked to heart valve problems, a condition Smith did not have.
Company lawyers said they felt vindicated by a poll the 12 jurors and one alternate took privately after being excused by state District Judge Katie Kennedy.
Several jurors said that there were eight votes for American Home, three for the plaintiffs and two undecided.
``I'm a scientist, and I was leaning for the defense because of the science,'' said juror Dave Sawicki of Houston, 47, who works in oil and gas.
``There were a lot of emotional adjectives and adverbs during the trial, but I kept looking at the risk of the disease, and it was rare.
Juror Gaetne Pauwels, who cried during testimony describing Smith's death and the children's suffering, said she felt ``exactly the opposite.''
``Evidence showing the company was negligent was flagrant,'' said Pauwels.
``I'm the same age as Mrs. Smith was and I have two children about the same age, so I could relate to what they would go through.''
Defense attorney Paul Stallings said he found the straw vote ``interesting'' because the defense was only into its second day and the plaintiffs had two weeks to present their evidence.
He said the straw vote will have no bearing on what the company does in other cases.
Plaintiffs' attorney Graham Hill said he was surprised by the straw vote.
He said the outcome would have been different after jurors deliberated.
Hill said that before the settlement was reached, Kennedy had allowed into evidence a memo written by a top FDA official saying the company had manipulated the agency, reversing her prior ruling keeping it out.
The judge, he said, also allowed evidence that the company threatened to sue a pharmacy that tried to warn customers about the drug's possible risks with a boxed warning on its pharmacy envelopes.
Smith took it for year.
No jury has yet deliberated on a fen-phen case, and the Smith case was the furthest any such case has progressed.
The first case to go to trial did not involve anyone's death and was settled for a reported $500,000 on April 8 in Cleburne.
Plaintiffs' lawyers have said that American Home wants to avoid a jury decision while it is trying to negotiate a settlement of all fen-phen litigation.
The company has refused to discuss those negotiations.
Smith, who weighed about 270 pounds, took the drug fenfluramine, brand named Pondimin, and phentermine for about a year and lost 70 pounds.
Her prescribing doctor, Leo Borrell, was also sued, but he was dismissed by the plaintiffs last week.
Smith died of a blood infection caused by a catheter used to pump in a drug to widen her pulmonary blood vessels, which the suit said had become constricted by Pondimin.
Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that about 5 percent of the fen-phen cases involve similar constrictions, called primary pulmonary hypertension.
Most of the fen-phen cases allege heart-valve leakage problems, while others claim ``neurotoxicity,'' which has various symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches.
European study said long-term users of prescription diet drugs had a 23-fold greater risk than the general public of incurring primary pulmonary hypertension.
But even for long-term diet drug users, the annual risk was low, estimated to be 23 to 46 per million users, and there is no widely accepted biological mechanism linking the drugs to the disease.
The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin and Redux, or dexfenfluramine.
Smith's attorneys claimed that for much of the early 1990s, American Home Products greatly underreported the associations of Pondimin with primary pulmonary hypertension to get FDA approval of Redux in 1996.
Until 1997, Pondimin's label said the drug had been associated with four cases of the disease and one death.
Company officials testified that they were aware of at least five associations as of 1991 and 62 associations and 11 deaths in 1996.
In the trial, company officials conceded the label was inaccurate, but said the FDA knew about all the reported associations and had never demanded it be changed.
They said part of the reason they did not change it was that they were awaiting the results of the European study.
Plaintiffs' attorneys also tried to show the company sought to avoid the most serious type of warning label, bordered by black boxes, because it would drastically cut sales.
Company officials said the boldfaced warning that was used was adequate and approved by the FDA, which had determined that the drugs' benefits outweighed the risks.
Phentermine, the phen part of the combo, was never associated with the same risks and is still available.
