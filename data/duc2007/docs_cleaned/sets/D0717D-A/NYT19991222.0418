American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness.
The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with Warner-Lambert would be completed.
Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, Pfizer's offer for Warner-Lambert was valued at $72.4 billion, while American Home Products' bid was $51.1 billion.
Warner-Lambert said in a statement late Wednesday that it remained committed to its merger with American Home Products.
But Pfizer wasted little time in questioning the wisdom of such a deal.
``We have offered a 41 percent premium over the American Home Products' offer,'' said Lou Clemente, executive vice president for corporate affairs at Pfizer.
``That's a $21 billion difference.
That tells us something anyway.''
Investors did not react so negatively to American Home Products' latest woes.
The company's shares fell 56.25 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $40.
Warner-Lambert increased $1.125, or 1.4 percent, to $82.9375.
Pfizer's shares rose $1.125, or 4.9 percent, to $33.75.
``Personally, I don't think the merger between American Home Products and Warner-Lambert will go through, but not because of the Mississippi settlement,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical analyst with Mehta Partners.
``But it doesn't help.
It's just one more reason Warner-Lambert should not merge with American Home.''
Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it.
Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine the ``fen'' in fen-phen and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed.
American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful.
Many analysts applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to court.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to pursue their claims in court.
``In my view, American Home Products' global settlement is now dead,'' said Ed Blizzard, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Houston who is involved in many fen-phen cases.
If you look at that $150 million award, it just shows you how angry ordinary citizens get when they hear about these charges.''
Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only 8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs.
About 500 of the fen-phen cases filed in Mississippi were from plaintiffs who lived elsewhere, including places as far away as Maine and Hawaii, American Home Products said.
Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in earlier news reports.
Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement.
After the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster than if they were to go to court.
``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite, Schneider, Bayless Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief negotiators of the national agreement.
``It is not meant to include every case in every state.''
The settlement in Mississippi won't be American Home Products' last day in court.
The company said that it faces a similar case next month in Massachusetts.
Meanwhile, the series of lawsuits filed between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert regarding Pfizer's hostile takeover bid will begin Jan. 10 in Delaware Chancery Court.
