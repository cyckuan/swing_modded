On the heels a successful damage suit trial in Fayette against fen-phen maker American Home Products, attorneys are again turning to a Mississippi court with claims of health damage caused by the diet drug.
The latest legal action was filed with Noxubee County Circuit Court on behalf of six women.
The suit comes only four weeks after a Jefferson County jury awarded about $400 million to plaintiffs who made similar claims against American Home Attorney Wilbur O. Colom of Columbus said the latest lawsuit seeks a larger award, which he said should send diet pill manufacturers a strong message.
American Home, pharmaceutical companies Wyeth-Ayerst and SmithKline Beecham and Savon Drug Stores are among the 12 defendants named in the new lawsuit.
Colom said a trial date would be set for some time in 2001.
Colom said his firm and partners in an Alabama law firm plan additional diet drug suits in Mississippi, including in Jefferson, Holmes and Claiborne counties.
American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical relative called Redux.
About 6 million people took the mix of fenfluramine and phentermine after it came out in the mid-1990s.
American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
American Home agreed earlier this year to pay up to $4.83 billion in a settlement that could cover all 6 million users.
The deal would pay claimants anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1.5 million, though thousands of suits remain.
