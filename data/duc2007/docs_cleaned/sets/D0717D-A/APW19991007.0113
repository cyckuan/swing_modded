American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today.
The settlement will include money to pay patients who say they were injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are still healthy.
Pending a judge's approval, initial payments will begin later this year.
American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin.
It also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in the United States, whether or not they filed suit, American Home said.
``This settlement provides fair and equitable terms for both diet drug claimants and American Home Products,'' and allows the company to ``move beyond the uncertainty and distractions of litigation,'' said chairman John R. Stafford in a statement.
Louis L. Hoynes, senior vice president and general counsel, reiterated the company's position that the drugs were safe for most people.
``The scientific studies conducted to date and clinical experience indicate that the health of the overwhelming majority of people who took Redux or Pondimin has not been adversely affected,'' he said.
On news of the settlement, shares of American Home rose $3.12 1/2, or 7 percent, to $48.25.
About 4,100 suits have been filed against American Home, making it one of the largest product liability cases ever.
About six million people took the drug combination.
American Home said the maximum amount available to any individual in the settlement is about $1.5 million, depending on the seriousness of their health problems, how long they took the drugs, their age and other medical conditions.
The settlement is optional, allowing users to pursue lawsuits on their own.
However, if American Home believes too many refuse to participate, it can terminate the deal.
The settlement terms call for payments to continue for about 16 years.
Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to total $1.85 billion.
The settlement covers all claims except for patients who say they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious lung disorder.
The company said it decided to deal with these cases separately because they are few in number.
It also noted that fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could cause the disorder.
The settlement includes a $2.55 billion fund to pay for injuries, $1 billion for medical monitoring and $200 million in plaintiffs attorney fees.
The company has also agreed to pay $25 million for heart disease research.
The company said the settlement would cause it to record expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance coverage.
American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last year and earned $2.5 billion in profits.
In the only verdict yet to be rendered in any fen-phen lawsuit, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas was awarded $23.3 million in July by a jury for heart damage she suffered after taking fen-phen for more than three months.
Last month the company said it settled the case for less than 10 percent of that amount.
