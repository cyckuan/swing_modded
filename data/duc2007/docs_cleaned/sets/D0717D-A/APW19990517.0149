Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves.
Debbie Stone Lovett of Grand Saline is suing American Home Products Inc. and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
Ms. Lovett is claiming she suffered moderate to severe heart valve damage after taking fen-phen for eight months starting in October 1995.
Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline, Texas, and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff said he will prove that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels.
``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said.
``By the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.''
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The Madison, N.J.-based company is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Several are class-action suits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage.
Sandra Moore settled for a reported $500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County.
Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months.
Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental anguish and seeking unspecified damages.
Petroff said the 36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux.
He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she took the drug.
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve damage.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
