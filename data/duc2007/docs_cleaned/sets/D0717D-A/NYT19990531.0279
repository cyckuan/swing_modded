The nation's first full trial of a lawsuit involving the death of a ``fen-phen'' diet drug-combination patient is to start Tuesday in Harris County state district court.
The trial is being closely watched because it could indicate whether jurors will buy arguments that the ``fen'' part of the combination could cause serious heart disease leading to death, as well as how much jurors might award in such cases.
Lawyers have declined to comment, saying state District Judge Katie Kennedy did not want them to discuss the trial before opening statements.
Lawyers familiar with litigation over the diet drugs have said several fen-phen death cases in the country have been settled for about $4 million to $5 million each.
The manufacturer of the ``fen'' drug, American Home Products of Madison, N.J., met recently with lawyers in New York and Houston to discuss a possible settlement of the potentially tens of thousands of fen-phen cases nationwide.
No figures have been discussed in the settlement talks, lawyers have said, but any such settlement would easily exceed the drug company's $1 billion insurance liability limit for fen-related claims.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled ``fen'' from the market Sept. 15, 1997, citing evidence it may have irreversibly, and sometimes fatally, scarred users' heart valves.
An estimated 6.6 million people have used the diet drug combination.
No jury has ruled on any fen-phen cases.
Although the settlement was supposed to be confidential, it was reported to be $500,000.
That case did not involve a death.
The plaintiffs in the Houston-area case are the survivors of Mary Marisa Smith, who died allegedly of primary pulmonary hypertension as a result of taking ``fen'' under the marketed name of ``Pondimin.''
The lawsuit does not say when Smith died or her age, only that she had a life expectancy of at least 50 more years.
The plaintiffs are her husband, two children and two parents, all of Harris County, which includes most of Houston.
They are seeking unspecified damages from American Home Products, Dr. Leo Borrell, who prescribed the drug, and the M.D.
Managed Weight Care clinic in Clear Lake, Texas.
The plaintiffs also name the manufacturers of the ``phen'' part of the combination, but a panel of state district judges has ruled that those manufacturers are not liable.
The lawsuit claims the defendants had ample knowledge before FDA's withdrawal that the drugs could cause serious heart disease.
All defendants have denied wrongdoing in court documents, saying evidence linking the drug to the disease is inconclusive.
The ``fen'' part of the drug combination was manufactured by a division of American Home Products, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia.
Two versions were marketed fenfluramine, sold as Pondimin, and a purer version of the compound known as dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, primarily Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass.
No studies linked this drug with the heart valve damage.
However, phentermine manufacturers were also sued in Harris County because they allegedly marketed phentermine to prolong the usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual 12 weeks to six months.
Phentermine manufacturers have been dismissed from most, if not all, suits around the country.
