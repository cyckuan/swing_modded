The manufacturer of the diet drug combination fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and often-fatal lung problems, lawyers said Thursday.
Negotiations with pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp. began several weeks ago, but talks are still too preliminary to put a price tag on a possible settlement, Houston lawyer Graham Hill said.
James Peterson, another plaintiff's lawyer, said the drug company initiated the talks.
The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the possibility of a national agreement Thursday, said American Home would pay billions of dollars under such a deal.
Last month, American Home reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen.
The company reportedly agreed to a $500,000 settlement to one plaintiff.
More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against fen-phen, and class-action lawsuits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future medical treatments have been certified in several states.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Attorneys for both sides met Wednesday in Houston, Hill said.
Other meetings have occurred over the past two weeks in Philadelphia and New York.
One possible settlement of the class-action cases could involve American Home paying for medical examinations of fen-phen users who have not yet reported health problems, Hill said.
It has not yet been decided whether those diagnosed with problems would be eligible for damages.
