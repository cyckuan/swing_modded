American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9 million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston Chronicle reported today.
The deal was reached Friday, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.
Attorneys and the company both declined to comment.
Virginia Brinkley, 55, had to have two heart valves replaced with artificial valves and was facing a third replacement, allegedly because of side effects from the drugs.
Her case was to go to trial on Monday.
John O'Quinn, her attorney, said Brinkley began taking fen-phen in 1995 to lose weight and treat an acid reflux problem.
Her heart valve problems were diagnosed a year later.
American Home made the "fen" in fen-phen, a drug called fenfluramine.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical cousin called Redux.
The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Phentermine hasn't been linked to problems when taken alone.
It is made by another company and is still on the market.
In October, Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits.
However, attorneys representing thousands of fen-phen users said they won't participate in the settlement.
