The first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen has ended in a reported $500,000 settlement for a woman who used the diet drug combination.
The settlement came a week into Sandra Moore's case against the pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp.
The 52-year-old former teacher had sought $110 million.
American Home said today it had agreed to a settlement but offered no details.
The Dallas Morning News, citing unidentified sources, reported that the company will pay $500,000.
Doctors found mild heart valve damage in Ms. Moore after she took fen-phen to promote weight loss, and she is on medication for her condition.
She claimed American Home knew heart problems could result but hid them to maximize profits.
Her lawyer, Michael McGartland, did not return calls seeking comment Friday.
American Home argued that Ms. Moore has a mild and common disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary.
The company said it acted responsibly in marketing and monitoring its products.
The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The drug maker has since been hit with hundreds of lawsuits.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
Ms. Moore's lawsuit, the first of its kind to go to a jury, was being closely followed by others with similar claims against the company.
Dallas lawyer Kip Petroff, who has 100 fen-cases, said the settlement could encourage more lawsuits, even from people who didn't suffer major medical problems.
``If a mild case is worth however much they got, I think there are lawyers who are going to be encouraged to pursue such cases,'' Petroff said.
Darrell Keith, a Fort Worth lawyer who said he has rejected several fen-phen cases, said he disagreed because such cases are expensive to pursue.
``To sue for $110 million and then a week later take half a million dollars is not what I call a victory; I call that a loss,'' he said.
