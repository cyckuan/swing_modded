American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of the pills.
Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against American Home in the suit filed in the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin and phentermine.
Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and marketed by AHP.
American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997 through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to the suit.
Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt when the drugs were banned, it said.
"As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of millions of dollars," said Glenn L. Cooper, president and chief executive officer of Interneuron.
American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual obligations with Interneuron.
Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997.
Pondimin was made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and marketed by American Home.
Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert.
Warner-Lambert is now in talks to merge with Pfizer Inc., putting the deal with American Home in jeopardy.
Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart valve damage after taking the drugs.
Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint said.
Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the information.
American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24 cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve disease.
In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the market.
Shares of Interneuron fell 50 cents to $3 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Shares of American Home fell $5 to $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.
