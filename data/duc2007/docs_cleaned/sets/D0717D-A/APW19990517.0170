Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves will try again to have her day in court.
``Too many people had their mind made up that fen-phen was dangerous,'' said Kip Petroff, an attorney representing Ms. Lovett.
He said lawyers were in the midst of questioning 62 prospective jurors when they decided they couldn't find an impartial panel.
Several prospective jurors in Van Zandt County said they had relatives who took fen-phen and would feel uncomfortable hearing the case, The Dallas Morning News reported.
Others, the newspaper said, said Ms. Lovett was responsible for her injuries because she continues to smoke a half-pack of cigarettes a day despite the known health risks.
Petroff said District Judge Tommy Wallace had set July 12 as a date for a retrial, where a larger pool of prospective jurors would be called.
When Lovett's case goes forward, Petroff said, he will prove that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels.
``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said.
``By the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them.''
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The Madison, N.J.-based company is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company.
Also named in Lovett's suit are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Several are class-action suits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage.
Sandra Moore settled for a reported $500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County.
Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months.
Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental anguish and seeking unspecified damages.
Petroff said the 36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux.
He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she took the drug.
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve damage.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
