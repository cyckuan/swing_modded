Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers today called on all local officials to immediately implement contingency measures to cushion the effects of El Nino, specially the shortage of water.
In the wake of President Fidel Ramos' call to respond to El Nino, Barbers said that local government units should lead in the drive to conserve water and take necessary steps to protect the country's water resources.
"We must immediately put into action practical water conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and allows us to recycle water," he said.
Barbers said local government units can enact ordinances banning the drawing of water from communal waterworks system for watering lawns, gardens, campuses, parks and for pressurized car washes.
He also urged local government units to monitor the use of all public deep wells, fountains, and springs to ensure that the water from these sources are properly utilized, preferably only for cooking and for other basic human needs.
Industrial users should have their own water sources so as not to prejudice the water available to the general public or unduly deplete communal water systems such as rivers and lakes, he added.
In the meantime, Barbers ordered all regional offices under his department to undertake an information campaign to disseminate water conservation measures and to explain the El Nino phenomenon.
It was reported that water shortage brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon will be very serious in the Philippines.
The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Metro Manila has announced that it will reduce water supply and the number of hours of water service.
"The lowered levels in our dams and water catchments will worsen even more unless the weather cycle brings us typhoons," Barbers said, adding it is necessary to "do everything possible to alleviate the adverse effects of the El Nino".
