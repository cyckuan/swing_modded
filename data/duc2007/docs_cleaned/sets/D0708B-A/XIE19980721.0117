And in the Southwest and North, karst formations can be an important source of water for many cities, but people have to attach importance to ground subsidence caused by the excessive use of water.
Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told the symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects, which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of water resources.
She said that diverting water from one area to another may benefit some areas for a short period of time, but the ecological damaged will have serious side effects.
The two academics have asked the central government to pay more attention to developing subterranean water instead of surface water, because it is the major water resource in many cities and is less likely to be polluted.
China should try to build a nationwide water monitoring system to provide accurate data for the healthy development of water resources and should increase pollution controls, one Finnish scientist suggested.
