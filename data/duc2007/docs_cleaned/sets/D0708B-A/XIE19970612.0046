Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today picked the ground for Mamloo reservoir dam near Tehran, a project designed to alleviate the water shortage problem in the capital.
The dam, on the juncture of Damavand and Jajroud rivers, 40 kilometers east of Tehran, has a designed capacity of 250 million cubic meters of water which will irrigate 5,400 hectares of farmland.
It will also operate a 8.5 megawatt hydro-electric power plant.
Speaking at the site of the dam, the president said that the main obstacle in the way of development of Tehran is water shortage.
To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand, Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj.
Mamloo dam will harness more than 200 million cubic meters of river water and turn it to drinking and irrigation water, he added.
Construction of Mamloo dam and the power plant, which will be completed by the year 2001, will cost 180 billion rials (about 60 million U.S. dollars).
