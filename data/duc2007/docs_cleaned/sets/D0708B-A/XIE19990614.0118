Water shortage in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad is expected to deteriorate as water reservoir can meet demand of the consumers just for 12 days.
The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days, experts said.
The water level at Simli dam has been declining over the past four months due to lack of rainfall, which has caused concern and panic among the residents in the capital who have experienced similar situation in 1994.
Failing to cope with the water shortage, the Capital Development Authority has resorted to further reduction in water supply to the residents who are already complaining of non-availability of the commodity.
Sources in the authority said that they have further reduced water supply in a bid to use the reservoir for as many days as possible.
Meanwhile, the authority has repeatedly called on the people to use water carefully and not to waste it.
Some residents are complaining that those people who installed moter pumps directly on main water pipeline are depriving their neighbors to get ample water supply.
If the crisis is allowed to continue, many residents will prefer to migrate from the capital as they cannot afford to live without water during scorching summer, said one resident.
