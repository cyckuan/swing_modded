People living in Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka are suffering from a shortage of drinking water, media reports Wednesday quoted official sources as saying.
Daily demand for water in the city with a population of over 9 million is around 1.4 billion liters, and there is a shortfall of 640 million liters, according to the sources.
The Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority supplies drinking water to the city dwellers through a total of 97 deep tube wells and a lone water treatment plant.
Besides, the system loss of water is about 50 percent due to mismanagement.
The daily demand for water in the city would rise to 1.8 billion liters a day by the year 2000, the sources said.
The scarcity of water in the city would be partially eased with the completion of the World Bank-aided 175-million-U.S.-dollar Sayedabad water treatment project, the sources added.
