Cyprus will take measures to tackle the severe warter shortage on this drought-hit eastern Mediterranean island, a government statement said on Monday.
The statement issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous said the Cypriot cabinet agreed last week to seek tenders for building two mobile desalination plants due to be put into operation before next summer.
Cyprus has one desalination plant in Dhekelia on the eastern coast, and the second is expected to be completed early next century.
The minister warned that water supplies could run out by the end of the year due to the extended drought.
He promised that the government would do everything possible to solve this problem.
"We will also investigate the possibility of importing water from abroad as an alternative," Themistocleous said.
He said the government will study the feasibility of introducing higher charges on water as a step to promote water saving.
Cyprus has also planned to encourage people to use water-saving devices and systems for recycling "grey water" for use in toilets and garden irrigation, the minister said.
Meanwhile, the government will also provide financial support to repair water pipe networks in towns and villages, he added.
