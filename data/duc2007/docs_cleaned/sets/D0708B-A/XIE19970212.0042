The Addis Ababa Regional Water and Sewerage Authority announced that the shortage of potable water in the capital city of Ethiopia will be solved in the last quarter of this year.
According to a report here today, the announcement was made by Tadesse Kebede, general manager of the authority.
Currently, the authority supplies only 60 percent of the city's potable water demand.
Tadesse said 18 water supply projects are underway at various stages, adding that one of such projects involved the sinking of 25 wells at Akaki, about 20 kilometers from Addis Ababa, which will supply 75,000 cubic meters of water daily to the capital city.
