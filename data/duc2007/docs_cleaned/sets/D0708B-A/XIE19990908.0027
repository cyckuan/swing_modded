The Rwandan government has launched a big campaign to ease water shortage rocking northeast Rwanda, the Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday.
The areas mostly affected are Umutara and Kibungo prefectures, known for their aridity and scarce water resources.
According to Bruno Mwanafunzi, Director of Water Resources in the Ministry of Energy, Water and Natural Resources, the situation in Umutara was exacerbated by an unusual drought that hit the disaster area because of a prolonged dry season.
Over three quarters of approximately 480,000 people in Umutara prefecture are faced with severe drought.
Umutara prefecture accommodates more than two thirds of the cattle reared in Rwanda.
