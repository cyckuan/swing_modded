Cyprus has decided to impose strict measures to save fresh water as the island's water reserves are currently at the lowest level since 1986.
Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides today called for urgent water supply cuts to deal with the severe water shortage which followed a dry winter.
"If this situation continues, there will be no drop of water left by 1998 in our reservoirs," the Minister told reporters, noting strict measures are "the only solution."
Petrides classified the measures to ease water shortage in three categories, namely the reduction of water supply, its better saving and the increase of water reserves available.
According to the minister, water supply to households will be cut by 20 percent, which means water will be supplied only three days a week, compared with 10 percent last year.
Water for farming purposes will be cut by up to 70 percent compared with 35 percent the year before.
The measures also include higher fines against people who waste water.
This can save up to 34 per cent of a household's needs, the minister said.
Petrides called on the public to make "painful saving" of water and said his ministry will launch an intensive campaign to increase public awareness of the problem.
The minister said water shortage will be solved "if we develop an increased awareness on water saving."
This East Mediterranean island relies mainly on rainfall for is water supply.
The first desalination plant is being constructed on the island and will be operational in April.
The government approved Wednesday a plan for setting up a second desalination plant near the southern town of Larnaca, which will be completed by 1998.
It is widely believed here that water shortage would be eased to a great extent once these plants become fully operational.
