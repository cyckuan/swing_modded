The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply with no sign of immediate improvement.
Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka.
Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for WASA to meet the demand.
They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage.
The onset of the summer heat has further drained the ground water in Dhaka while adding to the sufferings of some 6 million thirsty residents in the old city.
The officials held no optimism about an easy solution to the problem before a new water treatment plant starts operation.
