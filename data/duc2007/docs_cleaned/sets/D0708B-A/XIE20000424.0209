Water shortage in Pokhara, a famous city for tourism in Nepal, is so severe that surgical operations on patients can not go on smoothly in the Regional Hospital in the city, according to a report reaching here Monday.
Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr. Somat Singh Tulachan said that as the Drinking Water Corporation in the city was not able to supply water regularly, the operations on patients often had to be postponed when water was not available in the hospital.
"Sometimes operations were performed by fetching water in buckets," he added.
Singh admitted that lack of water had caused inconvenience to the patients and the hospital was getting dirty.
Some patients complained that they had to bring water from home for drinking and daily use.
And there is no regular supply of water even in the city, according to the report.
The Regional Hospital in Pokhara is the biggest hospital of the western region in Nepal, with 200 beds and about 500 out-patients daily.
Although Nepal is rich in water resources, water shortage is pervasive in the country because of its inability to tap the resources and the lack of well-managed supply system.
Even in Kathmandu, the capital of the country, regular water supply can not be guaranteed.
