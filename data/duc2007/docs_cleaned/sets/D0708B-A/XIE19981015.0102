Drought in Vietnam has caused a serious water shortage affecting about 3 million people in the recent months, Vietnam's English newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Thursday.
The daily quoted Le Huy Ngo, Vietnam's minister of agriculture and rural development, as saying at a meeting Wednesday in Hanoi to celebrate the international disaster relief day that "rainfall in the past nine months in most of the country fell sharply."
Ngo said the drought has bad impact on agricultural production not only in this year but also in the next few years.
He said the Mekong river water level is very low now, measured at two meters early this month, the lowest level since 1926.
If the drought persists, a shortage of water for power generation and cultivation will be unavoidable, Ngo added.
This year, the theme of the international disaster relief day is "preventing calamities with information."
