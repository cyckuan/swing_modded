Mexico, in a bid to raise the awareness of water conservation, has arrested at least 40 people in the capital city this year for water wastage.
The move came against a backdrop of a severe water shortage in the country.
Lack of water has already caused forest fires, poor harvest and desertification.
The police said the arrested will be release after each paying a fine of 500 pesos, or 60 U.S. dollars.
