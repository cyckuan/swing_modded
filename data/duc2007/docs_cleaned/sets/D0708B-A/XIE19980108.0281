Chinese scientists are searching for ways to alleviate China's water shortage problems through new technologies.
The scientists are trying to improve water pollution treatment technologies and increase reuse of water.
Technologies have been applied to treat industrial waste water discharged by paper making, leather, food, dying, and oil-drilling sectors, according to today's China Daily.
Ningyang County Paper Mill, a large plant in east China's Shandong Province, will take the lead early this year in trying a water pollution treatment technology approved by the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).
The process will be implemented at paper mills across the country in the near future.
Another project which will recycle 99 percent of water used in oil exploration is being used in oil fields, Wen Jianping, deputy-director of the China Research Center for Water Pollution and Water Reuse under the SSTC, was quoted as saying.
The project, developed by Wen's center, can treat 20,000 tons of waste water daily.
Wen and his colleagues are working on recycling discharged water from hotels, office buildings, car washes and public washrooms.
China is one of the many countries in the world facing water shortage, a situation plaguing more than 300 of its 660-odd cities.
