Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Friday called upon the people to save water at a time when the water shortage problem has affected various states including the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
Mahathir said the water problem was related to the change in the climatic situation in Malaysia and the most effective way was for everyone to save water and be thrifty.
The prime minister was commenting on the on-going drought and the problem of water supply in several states including Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca and Pulau Pinang.
The government is already implementing several programs to overcome the water problem and would take about five months to complete, Mahathir said in Jitra in the northern state of Kedah after a political party function, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
Mahathir said his deputy Anwar Ibrahim will chair a meeting of representatives of the relevant authorities to find a solution to the water problem which is becoming increasingly critical.
The water problem was more serious in Klang Valley covering Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas where, according to reports of the national newspapers, some 300,000 residents have been affected.
