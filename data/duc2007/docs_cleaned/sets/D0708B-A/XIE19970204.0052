South Africa Could Run Out of Water within 20 or 30 years if the current level of consumption continues unrestricted, Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal warned today.
Addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein, Asmal said South Africa's capacity for social and economic development would be seriously affected by the prospect of water shortage.
Asmal said his ministry is therefore reviewing the country's current legislations on water issues and would soon start to develop a national water management strategy to deal with the issue.
In this regard, a new water pricing policy is expected to be in operation in the near future, said the Minister.
It is reported that irrigation sector of South Africa's commercial farming in some provinces, especially the Free State Province, would be affected by the new measures.
However, Asmal assured that the Free State would not be deprived of its water resources if water is transferred from Orange River to the Vaal Dam, a major water supplier of Gauteng Province.
He said a recent study showed that there is more than enough water available in the Orange River to meet the increasing demand of all towns in the province, which are currently supplied from this River.
Last year, South Africa imposed temporary punitive water tariff on residents in big cities such as Greater Johannesburg owing to a short water supply of the Vaal Dam.
