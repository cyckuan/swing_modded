Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has urged residents in capital Dar es Salaam to use water sparingly as another water shortage is imminent.
The prime minister was shocked to find that the water level at Ruvu River, the main source of water of the city, is "alarmingly low" when he inspected the Ruvu water works Wednesday.
Accompanied by Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa, Sumaye inspected the Ruvu water works at Mlandizi in the eastern Coast Region, local press reported Thursday.
Sumaye ordered the Ministry of Water to make sure that wells dug in the capital city last year are operational as a preventive measure.
He also directed water technicians and engineers to find alternative water sources, saying that "this is not a time for water engineers to sit in their offices."
Below average rains associated to the La Nina weather phenomenon has led to a drought in most parts of the east African country.
The prime minister has called on residents to use water carefully when they wash cars and water flowers and trees.
In 1996, a long spell of dry weather resulted in a low water level of Ruvu River and shortage of supplies to Dar es Salaam.
