East China's Zhejiang province will spend 7.1 billion yuan on building water supply projects to meet the urban needs in the coming five years.
The official said that the main reason for the water shortage was inadequate government investment in building water supply projects.
While increasing funds in constructing more water supply facilities, the provincial government has decided to raise funds through different channels including overseas investment for such undertakings.
