The supply of water in the Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight days, the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here today.
Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage problem in Luanda.
He said that the government was short of money to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital.
It is the 10th day today that water supply in Luanda has suspended.
Such a suspension of water supply resulted from the cut-off of power supply to the water plant in the suburbs as large rain fell down two high-voltage power supply towers.
