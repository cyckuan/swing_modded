When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon, Ange, give us a show!''
And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well.
Nobody ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking.
Instead, as she was growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings and question the world around her.
``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've also helped me live my life.
Because, to me, to prepare to be a good actor is to prepare to live life.''
The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.
She has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart.''
Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace.''
In the former, she played a doomed fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on ``Wallace.''
``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and divinely talented.
She brings a hell of a lot to the party.''
Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's upcoming trio of movies.
In the current air-traffic controller comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to consuming vodka by the barrel.
Arriving this fall is ``Girl Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a mental institution.
Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her schizophrenic friend.
Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington.
On that one, Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her young career.
It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.
She did take a break once.
Jolie had just finished ``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never see the likes of it again.
She was married, if just temporarily, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers.''
And she was achingly unhappy.
``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie says.
And I didn't know what more I had to give.''
So Jolie took a break.
Sort of.
She took writing and directing classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized it didn't take too long that she really loved acting and that she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving.
Jolie has worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage.
She's constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve as a person.
It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find the motivation to grow.
At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home, absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives.
Acting was her professional life !ital!and!off!
``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the signals were always there that she might give that to acting,'' says father Voight.
But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility.
He and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career.
Jolie doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because they are so much alike.
On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and yet a bit mysterious.
Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things'' she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
She reveals herself through her acting.
And that's enough.
That's all she's willing to give.
``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says.
It's not just a movie.
It's a real experience that I remember forever.''
Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on screen.
There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty rare, pretty special.''
Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.
She also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything.
I'm hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer and be able to express it through my work.
And if Hollywood doesn't want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging, then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it.''
``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive to go through that transition because it's such an important one to express.
It's what life is all about.''
And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven, tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing.
