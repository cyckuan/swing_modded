Agent 007 and a massive restructuring effort helped drive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to its strongest quarter in a dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Santa Monica-based MGM earned $15.2 million, 8 cents per share, on revenues of $372.2 million.
This compares with a loss of $43.7 million, or 41cents, on revenue of $383.4 million in the 1998 fourth quarter.
Still, the company ended up in the red for all of 1999.
For the year MGM lost $530.9 million, $3.36 a share, on revenue of $1.142 billion.
In 1998 the company lost $157.65 million, $2.08 a share, on sales of $1.24 billion.
The 1999 loss reflects a pretax charge of $440 million to cover restructuring costs.
Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly performance to a variety of factors.
One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies.
The rights were resecured without a cash outlay.
``If you exclude the performance of `The World is Not Enough' in the fourth quarter, we still far more than doubled our ... performance,'' Taylor said about earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc., said the actions of new management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
``The results moderately exceeded expectations, by about $10 million.
But more importantly, there's good momentum on the deal side,'' Harrigan said.
``It looks like they've cobbled together a nice film slate for 2001 ... and gone a long, long way toward changing the limited talent relationships they've had over the last two years.''
This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova'' opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
On the television side, MGM's syndicated ``National Enquirer TV'' has just been picked up for a second season, and two new shows are being launched: ``Sexwars'' and ``Chatroom America.''
The latest Bond film is one of the most profitable of the decades-long franchise, collecting more than $320 million so far at the worldwide box office.
It is expected to continue to fill MGM's coffers this year, as it is released to pay-TV and video.
Three other MGM releases ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Stigmata'' and ``Tea With Mussolini'' also performed above expectations, Taylor said.
Among them are a remake of ``Rollerball'' directed by John McTiernan, a sequel to ``Silence of the Lambs'' titled ``Hannibal'' and the sequel ``Basic Instinct 2.''
Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.
