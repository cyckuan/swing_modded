The director and producer of the serial-killer thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie.
The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was attending film school.
``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov. 5 edition.
Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface.''
``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says.
``Angie's enormously gifted, and I usually get what I want.''
Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel Washington.
