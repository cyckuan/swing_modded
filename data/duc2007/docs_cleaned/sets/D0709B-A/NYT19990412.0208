By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) Even the hottest young actress in Hollywood knows when it's time to cool off.
After winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the television movie ``Gia,'' Angelina Jolie pushed past the press waiting outside, kicked off her heels and dove into the Olympic-sized pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Never mind her Randolph Duke dress with its 5,000 antique-crystal beads.
Never mind her carefully coifed hairdo or the Harry Winston baubles that surely weren't meant for moonlight dips.
``It surprised me that no one else jumped in the pool with me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
``Here I am, at an event with the wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and serious.
My question is, `Why wouldn't you want to jump into a pool?'''
If you think that's unusual, try this: After her award-winning turn in ``Gia,'' she actually contemplated quitting show business, just as her agent's phone was starting to ring.
The lips that have been described as being ``the size of sectional sofas'' curve in a frown.
Finding herself, in this case, meant going back to school for some film classes.
``It was at that point I realized how lucky I was to be on a film set,'' she says.
Depressed, she winds up having an affair with another controller (John Cusack), who happens to be her husband's main rival.
And, yes, going behind the scenes in the frenzied world of air-traffic control made her a little nervous.
There is just no way,'' the actress says.
``In fact, I'm the one who asks for the exit rows, because I want to be the one who gets everyone out.
``I'm not scared of much,'' she adds, ``because I really do live by the creed that I might die tomorrow.
In fact, I'm surprised I'm still here.
Honestly, I'm the kind of person who always could feel the clock ticking.''
These are troubled times for Jolie, who is recently divorced from ``Trainspotting'' star Jonny Lee Miller.
``We're great friends, and I love him to death,'' she says.
``We've been going through this breakup so slowly because we want each other to have all that we need in life right now.''
Her voice lowers.
``Right now we need to do things separately, but it's all done from love,'' she says.
``We're both holding each other's hand through this, and it's been amazing the divorce has actually brought us closer.
The other man in her life is, of course, her father, Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight.
Jolie's mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, divorced her father when she was an infant.
Jolie lived with her, but spent weekends with her father.
Smitten, the young woman trained at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and then hit Hollywood.
Early roles in ``Hackers'' (1995) and ``Foxfire'' (1996) led to a role as the wife of the title character in the cable movie ``George Wallace'' (1997).
More recently she was seen in ``Playing By Heart'' (1999), and she also appeared in the Rolling Stones video, ``Has Anybody Seen My Baby?''
She shakes her head at the memory.
``Imagine my surprise when they wanted me to walk down the streets in basically my underwear.
``The great thing is that it was New York,'' she adds, ``and no one cared.
People in restaurants were like, `Oh, there goes the girl from ``Gia'' in her drawers.'''
Next up is ``The Bone Collector,'' in which she plays a cop teamed with a paraplegic officer (Denzel Washington) in an effort to solve a string of murders.
She's currently filming ``Girl Interrupted,'' set in a 1960s women's mental institution and co-starring Winona Ryder.
``I've actually spent the last week strapped to a bed, which ... '' Jolie begins, then laughs.
``There is something so strange and kinky to all this stuff.
And awful I spent a week in solitary with a straitjacket on, too.
``It's set in the '60s, when girls were sent to a mental hospital because they were gay.
Women got shock treatments and they didn't remember their family a week later.''
As her three high-profile roles suggest, Jolie is in the process of moving from the ``promising'' category to the ``star'' category.
It's a process that she admits she still can't quite comprehend.
``It's so weird,'' she says.
``Let's take `The Bone Collector.'
I've seen the poster, which is me with a gun and a walkie-talkie.
In my mind, I look like I'm 5, playing dress-up.''
Less easy to accept is the media attention that comes with stardom.
She and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time.
She flips to the picture, and then scowls.
``Oh, this is hysterical,'' she says tightly, reading the caption aloud with an edge to her voice.
```Angelina, a bad girl, wears death tattoos and rubber clothes and likes to play with knives.
Some of this seems to have rubbed off on her old man.'''
Jolie fumes.
I'm really this goofy little odd person, and someday the rest of the world will discover it.
They'll find out that the girl in those evening dresses is really a complete idiot who spills coffee on herself and broke the phone by falling over it this morning.
``I'm one of the flawed people,'' she concludes.
