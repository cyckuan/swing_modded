creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,'' and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on Sunday.
``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being that Washington's character forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme is a quadriplegic.
Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
He remains on the force, however albeit bedridden and surrounded by an array of high-tech gadgetry and continues to help solve crimes.
Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme recognizes has potential to be more.
Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both playing variations of roles that they are known for.
Even in action roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and except for flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed that's what you see in this film.
But Washington, a former best supporting actor Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little.
And while his Rhyme character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real than any of the events in the movie.
The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem dangerous either to themselves, others or both.
Donaghy is no exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage.
It's not the character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality, that keeps you watching.
Jolie, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of Emmys.
Oscar won't be far behind.
Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to win the Oscar.
But win or lose, go back and check out some of Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike Lee ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995), which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under Fire'' (1996).
Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's ``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS.
Get ready for the force the force that will be brewing with the VHS release of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace,'' on April 4.
That's right, despite all the digital elements in the film, George Lucas' prequel to his three hit films will not be released on DVD.
Go figure.
But last year's surprise hit and this year's Oscar nominee for best picture ``The Sixth Sense'' will come out on DVD March 28.
``The Bone Collector'' (Universal) is priced for rental on VHS ($107.37) and is $29.98 on DVD.
