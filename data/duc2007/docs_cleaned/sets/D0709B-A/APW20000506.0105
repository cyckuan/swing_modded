Oscar winners Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie were married here in a no-frills, quickie ceremony.
The actors married about 3:30 p.m. Friday at the Little Church of the West on the Las Vegas Strip, chapel owner Greg Smith said Saturday.
The bride and groom both wore jeans for the 20-minute ceremony, he said.
The Clark County Marriage License Bureau confirmed Saturday that Thornton, 44, and Jolie, 24, received a marriage license Friday.
This is the fifth marriage for Thornton and the second for Jolie.
Thornton won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of ''Sling Blade'' and was also nominated for best supporting actor last year for ''A Simple Plan.''
Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight, won an Oscar this year for her role as a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl, Interrupted.''
The pair appeared together in ''Pushing Tin,'' a comedy about frenzied air traffic controllers.
They played husband and wife.
