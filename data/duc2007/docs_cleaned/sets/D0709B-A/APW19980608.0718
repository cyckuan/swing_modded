Below is a synopsis of a few currently playing.
Marshals.
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes and Robert Downey Jr. Director: Stuart Baird.

Desperate Measures.
Cast: Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia.
Director: Barbet Schroeder.
In this thriller, Garcia is a widowed cop in San Francisco whose son is dying of cancer.
The child's life could be saved with a marrow transplant.
The hitch?

Keaton conveniently escapes from the operating room just before surgery starts.
Keaton goes loose in the hospital and Garcia gives chase.
Playing God.
Cast: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie.
Director: Andy Wilson.
Eugene Sands (Duchovny), a surgeon who gets hooked on amphetamines and loses a patient on the operating table, witnesses a shooting at a disco and saves a man from death.

Great Expectations.
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro.
Director: Alfonso Cuaron.
The only ``different'' movie of the lot, it is a rags-to-riches story telling of society's foolish pretensions.
Finn (Hawke), a poor orphan, has a horrifying encounter with an escaped convict.
Years later, with complements of an anonymous benefactor, Finn goes to New York and becomes an established artist.
He thinks his patron is loony recluse Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft), and he dreams of winning her beautiful, icy ward, Estella (Paltrow).
In Money Talk$, Chris Tucker as the scalper-turned-escaped-con and Charlie Sheen, the TV broadcaster trying hard to save the day are still driving audiences crazy with laughter and nonsense.
