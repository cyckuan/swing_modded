Martin Margiela for Men For men who have hungered after the deconstructed trousers and expert tailoring of Martin Margiela, the designer is about to introduce a men's-wear line.
It will be in stores like Barneys New York in Manhattan and Los Angeles; Ron Herman, Fred Segal and Maxfield's, all in Los Angeles, and Blake in Chicago.
He will present the line, called 10, side by side with his women's wear on Oct. 15 during the women's collections in Paris, said Catherine Jiacomiai, a Margiela spokeswoman.
Unisex clothes have been a hallmark of Margiela's past work.
The emphasis was on pieces like T-shirts, coats and trousers that were the same design but sized differently.
``This is really a complete wardrobe,'' Ms. Jiacomiai said.
The new line will be designed from scratch for men and is likely to attract those men who wear Margiela's unisex clothes, as well as new customers.
It is consistent with the new attitude in men's wear of sharp but soft lines promoted by designers like Raf Simons and Alessandro Dell'Acqua, said Vincent Ehly, a men's-wear buyer for Barneys.
Margiela's line, a large part of which is prewashed or creased clothing, will cost about $360 for wool trousers, $120 for cotton shirts and $185 for roomy chinos.
As directional as Margiela's designs are, the men's line is expected to appeal also to those in search of classic clothes.
``The women's collection is a major part of the women's store at Barneys,'' Ehly said.
``So many women wear his tops and skirts like basics.''
Randolph Duke at Emmys The little problem of not having a business did not stand in the way of Randolph Duke's creating clothing for the Emmy Awards show on Sunday.
Duke was in Los Angeles Monday, basking in the glow reflected from three actresses who wore his dresses: Jane Leeves of ``Frasier,'' in an antique-green gown with paillettes and a boa; Kim Delaney of ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue,'' in a red matte jersey gown with see-through insets, and Angelina Jolie of the movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace,'' in a nude-tone double-slip dress.
Duke said that he did not accept a design fee for the dresses and that he paid out of his own pocket to have them made.
He declined to say how much the custom-made gowns cost.
The actresses will not be receiving a bill, he said.
``We have a lot of great relationships,'' said Duke, who is looking for backing and talking with prospective employers.
``We had calls from a lot of stars and stylists, and we called them, too.
I'm going forward.
Banana Republic Catalog The beauty of Banana Republic is that it is fashion made simple.
But apparently not so simple that some fashion-challenged customers don't need to have their hands held.
This week, the company introduced a team of style consultants to work with customers of its new catalog.
Reachable by telephone at (888) 906-2800, the consultants advise on everything from fit to accessorizing outfits.
``There are people who do call for figure-type information, body types and fit,'' said Sarah Gallagher, the company's senior vice president of catalogs.
``And some like the fashion element.''
This is the first Banana Republic catalog since 1992, toward the end of its illustrious safari days, when it sold clothing suited to living it up in, well, a banana republic.
Along with the style consultants have come other luxury services, like alterations and the ability to return items to Banana Republic stores.
