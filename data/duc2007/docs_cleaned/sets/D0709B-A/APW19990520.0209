The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or Claudia or another fab supermodel.
The cover girl's appeal?
She's a superstar, not a supermodel.
It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline.
Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior.
Ot they've become boring.
The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss.
And their heirs aren't apparent.
But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell better.
Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares about models anymore.''
Now Ms. Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.
It is not as dire as that,'' she said.
Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated by models' daily habits and ... their latest spats with their boyfriends or agents.''
Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in 1998, is flip-flopping those figures.
Vogue increased celebrity covers last year from two to seven.
Mademoiselle and Elle also have swung to star power.
``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms. Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for spring covers.
``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover because I believe they will sell more.
After all, that's what we're trying to do, sell magazines.''
Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science.
Not every celebrity cover scores.
And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah Winfrey.
Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 810,000 newsstand sales.
The talk-show queen likewise reigned in first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November.
Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top seller for 1998.
``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine.
She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know their every move.''
Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless personalities.''
Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone.
Naomi Campbell could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming ``Prisoner of Love.''
Is Ms. Campbell indeed the end of a breed?
About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known mannequins revolutionized the genre.
Perhaps they were too hot not to cool down.
Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on the horizon.
``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947.
Ms. Ford would know.
On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989.
``If you think about a Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who had more celebrity than most actresses.''
Still, Ms. Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek.
It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are the biggest draw.
Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would draw more readers.
''We almost died of horror.''
