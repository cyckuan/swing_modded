David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people who knew him, he still is.
Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer, he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980's.
But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.
He stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out, and died there of AIDS at the age of 38.
But at the moment he's back in New York in full force.

Reading is an essentially solitary activity, but talking about books requires at least two people.
Even if you live with another bibliovore, what are the chances that you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss, say, ``Bleak House'' or ``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment?
The growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the desire to talk about books as well as read them.

Americans march to Elgar at commencements as they march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't think about him most of the rest of the year.
To a nation with little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in unstylish?
But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even under the occasional bluster.
And now, for no reason apparent in the stars, a confluence of events has brought the composer to attention.
