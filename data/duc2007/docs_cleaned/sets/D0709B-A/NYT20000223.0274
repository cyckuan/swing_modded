We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but there was some debate as to which award that might be.
On the official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards take precedence over director.
We decided, however, that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards.
Which is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise.
Empathy played well in this category.
Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense.''
It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending.
Samantha Morton earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through to his pain.
And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' and, once the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the emotions remain real.
The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``Being John Malkovich.''
Jolie walks away with ``Girl, Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature belie a cold-hearted cruel streak.
Keener was first among equals in ``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to take advantage of just about anything including a passageway inside a character actor's head.
Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year, each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up benefiting from their selflessness.
And each, having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films (Keener), has more familiarity than the competition.
Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier, more versatile actress.
Morton, despite having a few movies under her belt, is more of an unknown but she's in a Woody Allen movie, and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted.''
Having an Oscar-winning pedigree dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for ``Coming Home'' can't hurt.
She's my bet for who'll take home the statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry.''
