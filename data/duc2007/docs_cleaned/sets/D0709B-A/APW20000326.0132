Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
''I'm surprised nobody's ever fainted up here,'' the 24-year-old actress said, thanking numerous people including her father, Jon Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for ''Midnight Cowboy.''
''Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father,'' Jolie said.
Jolie's honor was the night's first major award of the evening.
''Topsy-Turvy'' won two early awards, for makeup and costume design, while ''The Matrix'' won for sound.
''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy members.
Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with Billy Crystal as host.
The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
When nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and ''The Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture.
The standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put on an ad blitz.
DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American Beauty.''
The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
First, academy voters complained that they hadn't received their ballots for the final vote.
By the time a large supply of the ballots was found in a post office, the academy had printed new ballots.
The academy also extended the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
Then came The Mystery of the Missing Oscars.
Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52 of the missing awards while rummaging through a trash container.
Three Oscars remain missing.
Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity.
He was given a $50,000 reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars.
That's not a lot of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
Roadway trucker was charged with stealing the statuettes.
Weeks before the awards presentations, the academy announced the evening's special awards: Warren Beatty was named for the Irving Thalberg Award for a high level of producing.
Among his producer credits: ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Shampoo,'' ''Reds'' and ''Dick Tracy.''
Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland, won an honorary award ''for showing both the loftiest heights and the darkest depths of the European soul.''
His films include ''Landscape after Battle,'' ''Man of Marble'' and ''Man of Steel.''
