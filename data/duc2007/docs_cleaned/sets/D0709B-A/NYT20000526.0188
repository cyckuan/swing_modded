Angelina Jolie lives on the edge.
Forget planning.
Forget the future.
Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my hair?
Please.
Jolie, 25, delights in making waves.
This is a woman who literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor Billy Bob Thornton.
No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's ``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
That's an understatement.
Even her clothes are with that Jolie twist.
She isn't wearing DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
``Try Walmart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy lips to burst into a smile.
``Hey, it was the only thing that was clean.
After all, her career is in overdrive.
Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' opening June 9.
It's the story of two rival car thief gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the most merchandise.
It was my summer vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,'' Jolie confesses.
She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows his wheels.
``We actually had a real thief on the set escorted by his prison guard.
Forget logic.
Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress.
In fact, that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big screen version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,'' Jolie says.
``They told me there weren't many good characters for strong women.
But I countered that I've been able to play strong women.
Given the fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to me.
And frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was just so much cooler.''
Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.
Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her newfound status.
``Look, I have the same acting abilities.
It's not like I'm suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this box office clout,'' she says.
``It's just that now I'm on more covers of magazines.
It's easier to hire me.''
``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie says.
I'm someone who people took a chance on a few years ago when I was no one in this town.
And now?
I'm just an actress for hire.''
Don't think that she has a poor self-image.
``I've done justice to my roles.
I've always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've been offered.
In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I am the best person to do it.''
Jolie felt that way about her Oscar winning role in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
It felt so good.
It follows that she loves characters facing internal conflict.
``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,'' Jolie says.
``For instance, when I'm intense, I might be crying but a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying.
You know, if I'm soft I hate myself.
She mentions that being so tough isn't easy either.
``I'm one of those people who need to learn to let somebody hug me.
Enter Billy Bob Thornton.
Jolie shocked the world by marrying Thornton.
Said Jolie recently, ``I'm madly in love with this man and will be until the day I die.''
But Jolie, who's first husband was actor Jonny Lee Miller, mentioned that marriage frightened her somewhat because of the split of her own parents.
``But anything is a possibility,'' Jolie said.
I've become more centered.
