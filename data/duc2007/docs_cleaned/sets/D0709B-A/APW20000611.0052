The car-heist caper ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' raced to the top of the weekend box office, debuting with $25.5 million and pushing ''Mission: Impossible 2'' back into the pack, according to studio estimates Sunday.
''Gone in 60 Seconds'' overcame generally poor reviews that said the action flick squandered the talents of Oscar-winning stars Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall.
It was produced by action master Jerry Bruckheimer.
''Bad reviews don't matter,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office.
''People are looking for escape in the summer.
The movie's trailers promised some fun, so audiences went out to theaters to escape.''
''Gone in 60 Seconds'' likely will be gone from the top spot next weekend, when Samuel L. Jackson's update of the 1970s detective franchise ''Shaft'' debuts.
''Mission'' fell to No.
