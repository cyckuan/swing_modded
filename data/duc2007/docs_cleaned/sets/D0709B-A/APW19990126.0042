``Shakespeare in Love'' led movie nominees for the 5th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, and ``NYPD Blue'' edged ahead of the pack in television nominations announced Tuesday.
Also among the honorees was ``Waking Ned Devine,'' the comedy about a lottery winner in a small Irish town, which was named for supporting actor David Kelly and for its ensemble cast, which included actress Fionnula Flanagan.
``It's wonderful,'' Miss Flanagan said.
``I'm going to immediately send a fax to all the actors in the show.
We done good.
And the picture has given such delight to people.''
``Shakespeare in Love'' picked up nominations in five categories.
Among TV programs, ``NYPD Blue'' got four nominations, to three for ``Frasier'' and two each for ``The X-Files'' and ``Seinfeld.''
