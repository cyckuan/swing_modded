''Sling Blade'' Oscar-winner Billy Bob Thornton is recuperating at home after being treated at a hospital for a viral infection.
Thornton, 45, left a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, according to publicist Michelle Bega, who denied reports that Thornton's ill health was due to an eating disorder.
The actor-writer-director said several years ago that he once suffered from anorexia nervosa.
Thornton was hospitalized last weekend and his wife, ''Girl, Interrupted'' Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie, rushed from shooting a movie in England to be at his side, Bega said.
''He's doing wonderfully,'' Bega said, adding that Thornton intends to join Bruce Willis in a couple of weeks to work on the film ''Bandits.''
Thornton, who won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of ''Sling Blade,'' directed ''Pretty Horses,'' starring Matt Damon and due for release Christmas Day.
