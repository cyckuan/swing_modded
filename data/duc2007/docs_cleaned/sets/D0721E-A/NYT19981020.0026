What began as a rally down Fifth Avenue to mourn and protest the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming ended chaotically on Monday night, with nearly 100 arrests and several injuries after demonstrators faced off against police officers in riot gear and on horseback.
Several demonstrators and police officers were slightly injured during the loosely organized rally, whose planners did not have a permit to march in the street.
One woman was hurt by a police horse when mounted officers were sent into the crowd to disperse the marchers.
More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a ``political funeral'' to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21, who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
Carrying a pine coffin and memorial candles, the marchers had planned to march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to Madison Square Park at 23d Street.
Scuffling between the marchers and the police broke out at several points along the route when officers in riot gear tried to keep the demonstrators on the sidewalk.
Several organizers and marchers accused the police of over-reacting, and said there would have been no problems had they been allowed to continued along their planned route.
But police officials defended their response, saying the demonstrators created a safety hazard by spilling into the streets.
Ruth Finklestein, a march organizer, said that she was injured by a police horse when mounted officers rode into the crowd on West 43d Street in an effort to disperse the marchers.
``I'm taking part in a demonstration against the gay-bashing in Wyoming and here in New York City, which is supposed to be the center of gay life in New York,'' she said, nursing her swollen, bruised right ankle while waiting for an ambulance.
``We were doing nothing illegal, wrong or unsafe, and I was trampled by a horse ridden by a New York City police officer.''
On Monday night police officials said that they had made at least 96 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct.
One police lieutenant injured his finger in the fracas and was sent to a local hospital for X-rays, the police said.
First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher defended the police actions.
``They had a right to gather,'' he said of the marchers.
``But once they left the sidewalk they were endangering the motorists, they were endangering the pedestrians.
And we were forced to make arrests.''
But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who rarely minces his words when it comes to civil disturbances, struck a conciliatory tone when asked about the protest.
``It's a very worthy cause,'' he said on Monday night in Nashua, N.H., where he was visiting.
Marchers held aloft signs that said ``Stop Hate Crimes,'' ``Homophobia Kills'' and ``Where Is Your Rage?''
Many marchers said they were marching not only to protest the killing of Shepard but also to call attention to the problem of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City, where reports of such attacks have risen 78 percent so far this year over the same period last year.
``As lesbian and gay people, we know that Matthew Shepard is only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Sara Pursley, an organizer.
``We are people who live every day knowing that this could happen to us.''
The size of the march appeared to surprise both the loose-knit group of people who organized it and the police.
Kelleher said that the police called in more officers from all five boroughs when the trouble began.
``We increased the number of people significantly to put it back under control,'' he said on Moonday night.
