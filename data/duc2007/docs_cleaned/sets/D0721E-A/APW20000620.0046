With fresh prodding from President Clinton, the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate crime charges.
But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law enforcement.
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the principal sponsor.
''They tear at the heart and soul of our country.''
Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his appeal for Senate passage.
He also put in a few calls to wavering senators.
Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white men.
''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton said.
We have to pass this legislation.''
The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already covered under a 1968 federal law.
It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman, was pressing a rival approach that would set up a $5 million-a-year fund at the Justice Department to help state and local authorities investigate and prosecute hate crimes.
His proposal also would authorize a federal study to see whether hate crimes were not being prosecuted by state and local authorities.
Hatch said the Kennedy measure was overly broad.
For instance, he suggested that under it every rape prosecution could be deemed a hate crime and prosecuted in federal courts.
''There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate crimes is warranted,'' Hatch said.
''Serious constitutional questions remain.''
Another potential problem facing the Kennedy measure: Senate Republican leaders are wary of further weighing down the defense bill with irrelevant amendments.
Democrats are seeking to use the legislation to press a range of high profile issues in this election year.
Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser, said Kennedy was optimistic the measure would be approved, although he suggested the vote could be close.
The Senate adopted the hate-crimes legislation last year as part of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments, but it stalled in the House.
His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.
