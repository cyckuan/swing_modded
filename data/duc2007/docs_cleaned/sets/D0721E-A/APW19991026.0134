Aaron McKinney, accused of the fatal beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard, pulled out a gun and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked, a teen-ager testified Tuesday.
Jeremy Herrera, 19, said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano Morales III when McKinney went to his truck, pulled out a gun and hit Morales from behind.
It was the most sickening thing I ever heard in my life,'' said Herrera, who added he struck McKinney with a thick stick.
Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard's beating.
McKinney is charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery.
If convicted, he faces the death penalty.
During the first full day of testimony, jurors also heard from the coroner who examined Shepard's body, a bartender and Morales, who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker.
McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison.
Prosecutors say McKinney and Henderson kidnapped Shepard and took him to a remote area near Laramie on Oct. 7, 1998 and lashed him to a fence, where they robbed him of $20.
Shepard was beaten into a coma.
He died five days later.
