man convicted of killing a gay college student was sentenced Thursday to life imprisonment.
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
McKinney expressed regret for his role in the murder, which spurred nationwide rallies for legislation against hate crimes.
According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping.
President Bill Clinton praised the jurors' decision, saying "this verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to have a tolerant law-abiding nation that celebrates our differences, rather than deepening them."
"We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our society who lash out at those who are different," he added.
