judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial.
``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday.
Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson.
Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten.
He received two life sentences.
Henderson admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying him to a fence, but said he tried to intervene to prevent McKinney from inflicting a more severe beating.
He said McKinney, who has yet to be tried, struck him in the face.
McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty.
Henderson's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney, drawing another round of criticism from Custis.
