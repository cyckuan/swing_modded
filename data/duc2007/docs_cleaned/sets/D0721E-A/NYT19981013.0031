The death of a gay University of Wyoming student who was savagely bludgeoned and left lashed to a fence comes at a time of growing rhetoric and violence against gays.
Matthew Shepard, 21, died early Monday after being in a coma for nearly a week.
He had been robbed, beaten and pistol-whipped in the head so severely his skull was too crushed for surgery.
The father of one of two accused suspects said his son told him he committed the crime because he was embarrassed when Shepard flirted with him in front of his friends.
Anti-gay violence and even deaths are not new.
But Shepard's killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing.
Shepard lost his life at a time when describing homosexuality as a sickness that needs curing is gaining political currency.
``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals,'' said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.
``His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal treatment.''
The Christian right, led by the Center for Reclaiming America in Fort Lauderdale, last summer bought a series of ads in major newspapers claiming that love and religious teaching will ``cure'' homosexuality.
The group plans to air similar television ads soon.
Last spring, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told a television interviewer that homosexuality is a sin and that gay people should be helped ``just like alcohol or sex addiction .
Only 21 states, including California, have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation.
In Wyoming, three attempts to pass such laws have failed.
Lesbian and gay activists say that although polls show that most Americans favor nondiscrimination, their support can erode when laws don't protect gays, political leaders call them sinful and religious organizations say they can change if only they tried.
``There can be no stronger testament to how toxic the environment is that has been created by the extreme right than what happened to Matthew Shepard,'' said Kate Kendell of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco.
``It is crystal clear to lesbians and gay men in this country that hate rhetoric is directly linked to this kind of violence.''
Statistics are not yet available for 1998, but hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people increased nationally by 2 percent in 1997.
In high schools and colleges, violence against gays and lesbians gay youth increased a dramatic 34 percent, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs.
The increases appear to be a combination of both a jump in actual crimes as well as a growing readiness to report attacks.
In another study released earlier this year by the University of Washington, one in 10 community college students admitted to committing hate crimes against gays.
Some interviewed said an unwanted advance or flirtation was a legitimate reason for an assault.
Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming America, called the young man's death ``reprehensible'' and said the ads were not to blame.
``The main cause of the increase in violence in this country is our having removed moral absolutes from our society and turning away from what God would have us do,'' Folger said.
``When certain elements in our society advocate that everyone should do what they want to do, without any consideration of God's laws, our society will regretfully become more violent.''
Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San Francisco.
At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag was lowered to half-staff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.
San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno spoke briefly about the need for ending hate crimes.
``It's thrown into relief what I call the jihad against the gay community,'' Ammiano said, ``from Trent Lott to those ads to the fights against gay marriage.''
Next month, voters in Alaska and Hawaii will be asked to change their state constitutions to keep same-sex couples from marrying.
In March 2000, if a ballot petition submitted last month qualifies, Californians will vote on a law that bars gay marriages.
