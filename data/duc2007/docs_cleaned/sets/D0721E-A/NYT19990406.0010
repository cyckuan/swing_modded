The sentence of two consecutive life terms saves Henderson from the possibility of the death penalty but makes it virtually certain he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
It is not yet clear whether he will have to testify against Aaron McKinney, the co-defendant who will be tried for capital murder this summer.
Judge Jeffrey Donnell said in court Monday, as he dismissed the defendant's weak apology, that ``The pain you have caused here, Henderson, will never go away.''
Unfortunately, lawmakers in Wyoming and in other states seem quite willing to forget what happened.
In the days and weeks after the murder, it seemed that the nation would be awakened to the virulence of anti-gay beliefs that partly propelled this murder.
Matthew Shepard's youth, and the horrific way he died tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in the cold made many realize that homosexuals need protection from the kinds of hate crimes that have caused other groups in this nation's history to live in fear.
Yet in a very short time, the old prejudice that homosexuals are not discriminated against and do not warrant ``special'' protection has resurfaced in a backlash.
The Wyoming Legislature this winter killed an effort to pass the state's first hate-crimes bill.
The bill would have increased penalties for those convicted of crimes motivated by bias.
Anti-gay bias measures also died in other mountain states.
In an appallingly callous explanation of the defeat, one Republican leader in the Wyoming Senate said, ``My feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias crimes.''
The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than 1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.
Matthew Shepard is just one more grim statistic.
The conviction of one man and the trial of another for his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act.
But state and national officials must still show leadership in creating laws that send an unmistakable message that such hatred will not be tolerated in this society.
