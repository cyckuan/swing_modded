jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery in the case, and he could face the death penalty.
The other defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
Although McKinney admitted that he had committed the attack, his lawyers hoped to raise a type of ``gay panic'' defense.
In their opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances.
The presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which is allowed under Wyoming law.
The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.
Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.
In other words, the attacker should not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own homophobia.
Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.
Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty phase of the case.
Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in sentencing deliberations.
But that is quite a different matter from allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense for criminal acts.
