The testimony, by Sgt.
Rob Debree, came at a daylong proceeding Thursday.
In the evening, Robert Denhardt, a visiting county judge, ordered Aaron McKinney, 22, to stand trial on charges of first-degree murder, robbery and kidnapping.
The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 21, a friend of McKinney, has waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is to be arraigned on the same charges on Dec. 2.
Throughout the hearing, Dennis and Judy Shepard, parents of the slain student, sat stoically in Albany County Court as police witnesses provided new details about a crime that produced a national wave of anger at anti-gay violence.
Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on campus.
Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview with McKinney on Oct. 9, two days after the beating and three days before Shepard died in a hospital in nearby Fort Collins, Colo.
In that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.
By McKinney's account, the detective said, the attack began after Shepard had placed his hand on McKinney's leg as they drove through Laramie.
``Guess what, we're not gay,'' the detective quoted McKinney as saying he had told Shepard.
``You're going to get jacked.
It's Gay Awareness Week.''
The detective said McKinney had admitted hitting Shepard three times with fists and six times with a stolen revolver.
An autopsy found that Shepard had been hit 18 times in the head.
He was also bruised on the backs of his hands, indicating that he had tried to protect himself, and around the groin, indicating that he had been kicked repeatedly.
About 18 hours after the beating, a bicyclist found him still alive, tied to a ranch fence.
Reggie Fluty, an Albany County sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face.''
Laramie police officer, Detective Ben Fritzen, testified that he had interviewed Kristen Price, McKinney's 18-year-old girlfriend.
Fritzen said that in explaining the violence, McKinney had told Ms. Price, ``Well, you know how I feel about gays,'' Ms. Price and Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, waived their right to preliminary hearings and are to be arraigned on Dec. 9 as accessories after the fact.
Custis also said a watch and other belongings left at the crime scene showed that robbery was no factor.
But Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said Shepard's wallet had been found in a dirty diaper in the kitchen of the Laramie apartment shared by McKinney, Ms. Price and their 4-month-old son, Cameron.
Addressing the judge, Rerucha said: ``They beat him for $20, your honor.
That was the contents of the wallet.''
