California's hate crime law would get beefed up for murderers of gays, lesbians and the disabled under a measure approved by the Assembly with strong Republican support.
Current California law requires a sentence of life in prison without parole or the death penalty for anyone who deliberately sets out to kill someone because of race, color, religion or nationality.
Because of his own objections and concerns from gays and lesbians, Knox's bill would instead increase the penalty from the current 25 years to life in prison, to life in prison without parole.
``The district attorneys literally were having cases where people confessed that they had murdered people because they were gay or lesbian, and could not charge them with special circumstances,'' Knox said.
His measure passed the Assembly Wednesday with a 55-17 vote and now moves to the Senate.
The bill got the support from some of the most conservative Republicans, who saw the legislation as tough on crime.
One Republican, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose, offered an amendment Wednesday to add the death penalty to the bill, but was turned down by the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
Under the Knox bill, a prosecutor must prove the victim was intentionally killed because of his or her actual or ``perceived'' disability, gender or sexual orientation.
The bias must be an actual cause or substantial factor in prompting the killing.
The California Department of Justice said 10 people had been murdered in the state between 1995 and 1997 as a result of hate crimes, although a number for gay-related murders was not available.
There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate Crimes Unit.
Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in legislatures around the country this year on issues important to gays and lesbians.
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is tracking several in California, including a measure to protect gay and lesbian high school students from discrimination.
