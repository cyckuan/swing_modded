Matt Galloway talks in sporadic, sometimes emotional bursts.
His hands fly around.
His body tries to keep up.
At least that is how Stephen Belber portrayed him onstage.
``But I guess I really do talk like that.
It was pretty accurate.''
As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts of town all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay.
After five days in a Colorado hospital, Shepard died.
The roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole.
The serendipity of Galloway's role in Shepard's life, as well as the relationships that scores of others had with Shepard, have been woven into an emotional performance, drawn from court records, personal journals and 200 interviews in Laramie conducted by Kaufman, his writers and his actors.
``The Laramie Project'' examines homophobia, class distinctions and cowboy culture by blending the chronology of the case with the anger, confusion, sadness and embarrassment it left behind.
The play ultimately questions whether Laramie, or the nation, has changed as a result.
The words of more than 60 people are conveyed by eight actors simulating the appearance, mannerisms and speech patterns of the people they interviewed.
Kaufman, 36, who wrote the critically acclaimed play ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' said his new play represented an effort to use the stage as a journalistic medium.
And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and television reporters who face daily deadlines.
Kaufman even breaks a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy sheriff who first reached Shepard at the fence, learned later that the victim was HIV positive and feared that her efforts to resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS.
She began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.
But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to reflect on his lifestyle.
Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage who attended the opening performance.
In an interview, he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use the word ``fag'' to describe a gay man.
At the same time, he recalled two customers coming into the Fireside last week, asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments.
Galloway said he was repulsed by the request.
Zackie Salmon, 52, who manages a scholarship program at the university, was briefly portrayed onstage, expressing repugnance at one of the killers, Aaron J. McKinney.
As a lesbian, she said, she has noticed that the death of Shepard has had some salutary effects on Laramie's gay and lesbian population, which is larger than most gays and lesbians there had ever realized.
``Before this incident, I would have never felt as comfortable being who I am,'' Salmon said.
``After the Matthew Shepard incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to face what happened in our community and we're going to change.''
But even so, Salmon added, she has a lesbian friend who works in a different department at the university who has told her that she fears she could lose her job if her sexual orientation were made public.
But I still won't do it in Laramie.''
