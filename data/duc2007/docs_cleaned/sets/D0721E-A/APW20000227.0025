An emotional audience greeted the world premiere Saturday of ``The Laramie Project,'' a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater troupe and the people of Laramie, Wyo., about the murder of Matthew Shepard.
They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media.
The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater through April 1.
``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,'' said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men who killed him.
It is interesting to undo the wound that you think is healed, but it hasn't.''
The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation, including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard.
Their thoughts and opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.
Shepard's death in October 1998 received national attention.
He was beaten, hung on a fence in a lonely prairie field and left to die.
Two young men, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what this nation is and where it is going as a society.
In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for ``gross indecency.''
``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender, sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.
``And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel victimization and murder, did a similar thing.''
