Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage'' because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here.
The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale for the killing from Cal Rerucha, the prosecutor for Albany County, who said that McKinney and a friend, Russell Henderson, fully intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of $20.
For that, prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for McKinney.
Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death penalty.
He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no chance of parole.
The case attracted wide attention.
Shepard, 21, was beaten more than 20 times on the head with a .357-magnum handgun, tied to a fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die.
He was found by a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital, where he lived only four more days.
The case became a rallying cry for states and the federal government to pass and expand hate-crime measures, but fewer than half the states have passed such measures, and Wyoming remains one of eight states with no hate-crime laws.
Federal lawmakers last week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's sexual orientation.
Nor has the case appeared to stir much interest in Laramie.
The spacious courtroom was far from filled.
Shepard's mother, Judy, sat with several friends opposite several of McKinney's relatives, including his father, Bill McKinney.
Otherwise, the audience was made up of mostly reporters.
In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.
But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse.
Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at a local bar.
But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman argued that McKinney was ``haunted by a past, that put him into a rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos.''
The distinction is important.
If prosecutors can prove malicious intent and premeditation, they have a better chance of winning a death sentence.
If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved from a moment of passion or rage, they may persuade the jury to find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge, like manslaughter.
But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case, it might be difficult to win a death sentence.
Wyoming is one of 38 states that have a death penalty but one of the least inclined to use it.
Since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment was constitutional, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado and Ohio each have put to death only one prisoner.
Wyoming has only two inmates on death row.
Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6, 1998, from the Fireside Lounge, where McKinney and Henderson encountered Shepard, to the beatings, which began as the two drove Shepard around town and continued at the fence.
But in Tangeman's version, Shepard was portrayed as a sexual predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had ``reached over and grabbed Aaron's genitals and licked his ear.''
As a result, Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Tangeman said the older boy threatened to spread the word that McKinney was a homosexual.
Also, Tangeman said, McKinney at 15 had a consensual sexual encounter with a male cousin.
