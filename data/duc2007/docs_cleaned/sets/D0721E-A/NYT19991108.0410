Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
``We call upon the president and Congress to come together, put all differences aside and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act,'' said Shepard's father Dennis at a news conference in front of the U.S. Capitol.
``We urge our nation's leaders to take every possible action to end the violence that killed our son.''
The legislation ``will not end hatred and will not even stop hate crimes from happening,'' Shepard added.
``But it can reduce them by making it easier for our federal government to put resources into the hands of people best suited to combat these crimes local law enforcement agencies.''
Shepard's mother Judy stood by her husband but did not speak.
On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.
He died five days later.
Both assailants were convicted and given double life sentences.
In July the Senate approved the legislation as part of an appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments, but the House did not.
Republican leaders dropped the measure entirely during a conference committee of House and Senate lawmakers.
Current federal law permits federal prosecution of a hate crime only if it is believed to be motivated by the victim's race, color, religion or national origin.
In addition, the assailant must have intended to prevent the victim from exercising a federally protected right, such as voting.
The new measure would add attacks against people because of their gender, sexual orientation or disabilities to the covered crimes while eliminating the protected-right requirement.
Thus, it would make federal prosecutions easier to pursue and relieve local jurisdictions from the financial burden of trying such prosecutions.
Speaking to reporters Monday shortly after the Capitol news conference, President Clinton said at the White House, ``We must pass strong hate-crimes legislation.''
He added, ``I want to express my personal appreciation'' to the Shepards for coming here to lobby for the measure.
At the Capitol briefing, Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., pressed his colleagues to adopt the measure before lawmakers adjourn in the next several days.
He cited reports that hate crimes against gays and lesbians are on the rise.
``It can be done, and it must be done,'' Jeffords said.
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who assessed the chances of passage at ``50-50,'' said gays and lesbians need federal protection.
``Some crimes are so odious that an extra measure of protection is demanded by us so that can never again be repeated among us.
``Never again should we in the federal government withhold our help and stand idly when a Matthew Shepherd is tied to a fence, beaten and left to die because he is gay,'' Smith added.
He accused Republican opponents of the measure of blockig its passage ``because it has to do with the issue of homosexuality, and many people are uncomfortable with that.''
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., issued a challenge to GOP colleagues who oppose abortion rights.
``If you are really pro-life as you say so often in so many debates, then prove it in this case that you are ... pro-every human life,'' he said.
Another speaker at the news conference, Robert DeBree, an Albany, Wyo., sheriff's detective, said that after McKinney was found guilty last week of robbing, kidnapping and murdering Shepard, he went back to a detention center and ``was smiling and laughing'' as he watched news reports of himself on television.
DeBree added, ``We have to got to send a message somewhere, and it has to begin here.
Congress, please pass this.''
Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have hate-crime laws that include sexual orientation while 20 have hate-crime laws that do not.
Eight states have no hate crimes laws.
In addition to meeting with lawmakers, Dennis and Judy Shepard met Monday with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and Attorney General Janet Reno.
On Tuesday, Dennis Shepard said, he will try to meet with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.
