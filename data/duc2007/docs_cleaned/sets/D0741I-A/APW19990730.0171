Authorities are grimly piecing together what they know about Mark O. Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and killed nine people.
Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in.
Authorities later said he had killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst workplace massacres in the nation's history.
Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer.
Seven remained in critical condition today.
This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were open.
God bless you.''
At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked outside.
``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed.
``Unfortunately true.''
Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday.
But Barton's family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims died.
``We have no idea what caused Mr. Barton to begin shooting,'' Mayor Bill Campbell said.
Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.
Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least three more people.
It was the latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed.
Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of Atlanta about 3 p.m. Thursday.
Four people were dead within minutes.
``There was a trail of blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other.''
It wasn't immediately clear what relationship Barson had with the Momentum firm, if any.
Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont Center building where he had been a client.
Five died there.
Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day.''
Barton came into the office ``and after speaking with our branch manager, suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the manager and his secretary,'' Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, said in a statement released from the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J. ``This man then went into our main trading room and began indiscriminately shooting the customers.''
Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting at her computer when she heard shots.
``He was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings.
The bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I was able to escape,'' Campbell said the victims were shot with 9 mm and .45-caliber handguns.
For the next five hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him.
Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings.
``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51.
``We had no idea what was going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm.''
About five hours after the shootings, Barton showed up at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, where he approached a woman in the parking lot, said Cobb County police spokesman Dana Pierce.
``She was able to run away and contact security,'' he said today.
``What his intentions were with her is a still part of the investigation.''
He wasn't sure if she recognized him from news reports or was afraid because of something he had said or done.
She contacted mall security, and around the same time, someone else also spotted Barton's dark green minivan.
Police were alerted and began chasing Barton up Interstate 75.
The chase ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall.
``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.
The bodies of Barton's 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, and children, 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, were found in their home in Stockbridge, 16 miles southeast of Atlanta.
Police said they had been bludgeoned to death perhaps as long as two days before the office shootings.
The children's bodies were in their beds, with sheets pulled up to their necks and towels around their heads so only their faces showed, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County.
Mrs. Barton's body was in a closet.
He did not elaborate.
``He was the No.
