Long considered the only suspect in the hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama, Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the case.
``He told me that he would never go to jail,'' Danny Smith recalled Friday.
Barton upheld the vow.
He committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife.
Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Spivey, in 1993.
Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a hatchet.
``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.
``We didn't have any fingerprints.''
Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
Afterward, his wife and two children were found dead in their apartment.
They had been beaten with a hammer.
In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings.
But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' denied committing the '93 killings.
In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
Barton was the only suspect ever considered.
``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not prove it legally.''
The women were found dead inside a blood-splattered trailer at a campground along Weiss Lake.
As many as 600 people were at the campground when the women were killed.
Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
He also refused a polygraph test.
It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was murdered.
Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
Barton refused and eventually settled.
Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
After Barton remarried, he would periodically call Smith and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.
``It was a game to him.
He got mad at me one time because he couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.
