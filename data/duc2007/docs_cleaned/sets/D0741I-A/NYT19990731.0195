Some four hours later, Barton went on to commit the worst slaughter in Georgia history.
``He did not have beady eyes or a stubbly beard or anything like that,'' said Joe Fowler, a prominent attorney in Douglas County with deep roots in the community.
``He just seemed real normal, just talking.
The people in the office (looking back on the then-innocuous meeting) are just freaking out.''
It's a surreal episode in the spiraling end of a deranged man, who, while struggling with internal demons that drove him to kill himself and others, was also tying up loose ends just finishing some errands.
``It's odd that someone who has done this would be able to act with such deliberateness, such coldness,'' Fowler said of the 15-minute, otherwise forgetTable encounter.
Barton had also come to Fowler's office Monday to make ``routine'' changes to his will.
He returned for the short visit Thursday to again tinker with the document.
It was concerning simple matters that Barton did not even have to come in person to do, Fowler said.
The attorney said Georgia State Bar Association guidelines prohibit him from talking about the will until it is sent to court to be probated.
That will occur after a death certificate is signed in a week or so.
On Thursday afternoon, Fowler was contacted by Henry County police, who were concerned about his safety.
Fowler's name was cc'd on a note that Barton left in his apartment with the bodies.
Fowler and his staff were given police protection until Barton later killed himself.
However, Fowler does not believe that Barton meant him any harm.
Barton first approached Fowler not long after the 1993 slaying of Barton's wife, Debra, and his mother-in-law, Eloise Spivey, for help with some legal matters, including estate planning.
Part of that work later included a $450,000 settlement in 1997 from an insurance company on a $600,000 policy Barton took out on his wife two months before her slaying.
About $150,000 went to Barton's two children, Matthew, then 9, and Mychelle, then 6.
The insurance company initially fought the payment, accusing him of the murders.
Police also strongly suspected Barton of the savage bludgeoning slayings, as did the Spivey family and others in Douglas County.
Fowler, a deeply Christian man, was ambivalent about his own thoughts.
``Yeah, I heard the talk and Mark did, too,'' said Fowler.
``As a lawyer, you can't separate it.
You cautiously presume the best until shown otherwise.
