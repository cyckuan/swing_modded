Instead of being angry at Mark O. Barton, Pastor Doug Davis asked the congregation of about 200 mourners in Lizella Baptist Church not to give into the ``temptation'' of focusing on last week's ``horrific event.''
``We have 27 years of wonderful memories of her life and only a few hours of shocking memories of her death,'' Davis said.
``Let us remember and celebrate her life today and in the days to come, and not allow her murder to forever cloud our memories.''
But there was evidence the nation was still focused on Mark O. Barton's shooting spree Thursday at two Buckhead office buildings, where he left nine dead and 12 injured.
He later shot himself in the head in an Acworth, Ga. gas station.
About 20 news reporters and photographers lined the roadside in front of the red brick church southwest of Macon to capture images of grief for a country that wants to know why.
Why a man would kill his 27-year-old wife and children, Matthew, 11 and Mychelle, 8 with a hammer?
Church members passed out bottles of spring water and cups of ice water to sweat-drenched photographers listening to the service over a loudspeaker outside.
Inside, Leigh Ann Barton's white coffin lay draped with a blanket of pink roses.
``Leigh Ann loved to take photographs,'' Davis said.
``As a result, the family has many pictures of Matthew and Mychelle being accepted and cared for by this large extended family.
Indeed, Matthew and Mychelle were just as much a part of this family as any of the other children.''
Between the hymns of ``I'll Fly Away ,'' and ``Amazing Grace'' Davis read a note by Leigh Ann's older sister, Dana Reeves, 32.
``My dearest honey,'' the letter began, using the family's nickname for Leigh Ann Barton.
After the service a half-dozen pallbearers carried Barton's coffin past white columns and down a walkway to a waiting blue hearse.
Organ music played from the outside speaker as parishioners filed out of the church, some sobbing.
One friend among a group of Girl Scouts in uniform cried out loud.
The blue hearse transported Barton's body to Old Valley Grove Primitive Baptist Church, about 110 miles south of Macon.
The family decided to bury Barton in a small cemetery next to the Irwin County church's new social hall.
Barton's mother lives in the community.
Family and friends who made the trip mingled in front of the new building before gathering around the burial tent to lay Barton to rest.
Nearby, expansive fields of green soybean and cotton plants withered in the heat.
Pastor Davis' words back in Lizella lingered: ``God's love is stronger than pain.
God's love is stronger than death.
God's love is stronger than any sickness than a Mark Barton or anyone else can dish out.''
