Barton, who had split up with his wife earlier this year, had been living with his two children from a previous marriage in the southern suburb.
The three of them moved out over the July 4th weekend, and the children told neighbors they were moving to nearby Stockbridge to live with their stepmother, identified by a neighbor as Lee Ann Barton.
The bodies of Mrs. Barton and the children were found in Mrs. Barton's apartment after Barton went on the rampage at two brokerage offices, killing nine people.
Barton later committed suicide when police closed in on him in his dark green van at a gas station in northern Atlanta.
Police in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located, said handwritten notes left on the bodies indicated that Mrs. Barton may have been killed Tuesday and the children on Wednesday.
The children were in their beds and his wife was in a closet.
Police said a typed note was found in the living room explaining his actions.
Barton had lived in Morrow for about a year, renting a neatly kept, two-story house in a modestly priced residential neighborhood, said Christine Johnson, 58, who lived two doors away.
Barton, a chemist, seldom left his house and was always at work on his computer, Mrs. Johnson said.
When he did leave the house, it was to walk around the neighborhood for exercise.
``He kept to himself,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
``If he drove by in his van he threw his hand up.
But that was about it.''
Another acquaintance in Morrow, Marsha Jean DeFreese, said Barton went to church and was a Scout master of her grandson's troop.
She said he took them out every Tuesday.
``He looked odd to me,'' she said.
Police said the children, Michelle and Matthew, were ages 7 and 12 respectively.
Cindy Northcutt, 38, who lived on the same street as Barton in Morrow, said Barton ``always seemed preoccupied.''
``He had other things on his mind,'' she said.
``He didn't seem friendly at all.
He was making an effort to have something to do with you.''
Neighbors in Morrow said Mrs. Barton was active in the Girl Scouts.
On Wednesday, she was expected at an outing, but never showed up.
In 1993, Barton's first wife and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death at a campground in northeast Alabama.
Authorities said Barton was the prime suspect, but he was never charged.
The couple had two children, who were in Barton's custody after the slayings.
