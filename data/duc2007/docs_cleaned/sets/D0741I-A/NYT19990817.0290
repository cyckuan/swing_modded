Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc., one of the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those losses.
The complaint, filed on behalf of Dr. Gulsham Harjee, whose husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent in the day trading arena.
Harjee declined to comment Monday.
``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said.
``Shouldn't these firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every day check these people out?''
Barton was losing a lot of money, and the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the suit.
``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious society, I expected this to happen.''
Harjee is seeking undetermined damages from the Piedmont Center, Barton Protective Services and Barton's estate.
Barton Protective Services, the company that provides security for the Piedmont Center, a complex of 11 buildings where All-Tech's offices are located, is not connected to Mark Barton.
The security company's chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.
Harjee also seeks assault and battery damages against Barton's estate.
Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was a regular.
The killings were initiated at Momentum, directly across the street from All-Tech.
At least 13 other people also were wounded.
In the two days before the shootings, Barton also killed his wife and two children, beating them to death with a claw hammer.
The frustrated chemist-turned-day trader killed himself the night of the multiple murders after two officers surrounded his minivan at an Acworth gas station.
