Alyce F. Wenzel, the mother of 30-year-old shooting victim Scott Allyn Webb, claims in her lawsuit that Momentum Securities, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas and Barton Protective Services failed to prevent the killing of her son.
Momentum should have known Barton was engaging in high-stakes trading and suffering major losses, the lawsuit said.
``Momentum .
Furthermore, the three companies ``should have known of the potentially dangerous conditions contained on the premises and failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitees within the office complex from the reasonably foreseeable criminal acts of a third person.''
Momentum Securities is the company where Webb and three other people were shot and killed July 29 by Barton.
Five other people were shot to death across the street at a second day trading firm.
Jones Lang LaSalle Americas is the owner and manager of the building at 3500 Piedmont Road where the killings took place, and Barton Protective Services is the company responsible for the building's security.
Barton's estate is also named as a defendant.
Momentum Securities released a brief statement expressing sympathy for the victims of the shooting rampage, but said it is not responsible for it.
``It is important to remember that Mark Barton, not Momentum Securities, is the one who was and is responsible for these tragic and unforeseeable events,'' the statement read in part.
Other defendants either declined comment or could not be reached.
Wenzel is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, court costs and attorney's fees.
In August, two weeks after the shooting, the family of Dean Delawalla, who was shot to death, filed a similar lawsuit.
On Sept. 27, the family of Yuzef Liberzon, who is recovering from gunshot wounds at Atlanta's Shepherd Center, did the same.
Meanwhile, a fourth lawsuit is likely on the way, said Jan P. Cohen, an attorney for the victims' relatives.
Cohen declined to identify who would be filing the fourth lawsuit.
