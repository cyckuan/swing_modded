Last Christmas, Mark O. Barton sat down with his estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market.
As the story unfolds of a man haunted by mounting debt and persistent accusations he had killed his first wife, new details emerge daily about the astounding losses Barton suffered in the market.
Barton lost as much as $450,000 gambling on Internet stocks in the past year, ventures financed by money he obtained from his first wife's life insurance settlement and possibly by tapping into a trust fund set up for his two children, according to family members and police.
In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.
The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his sister-in-law, said Tuesday.
Last October, about the time his wife left him, Barton went to a Macon suburb to see Argo and her husband, Gary, Barton's confidant.
The Argos said Barton told them he had lost $250,000 and had only about $20,000 left.
``He's called Gary before in tears when he has lost big amounts of money,'' Kelly Argo said.
By the time Barton faced Leigh Ann at Christmas, the losses were approaching $300,000.
She was furious with him, Kelly Argo recalled.
But Barton couldn't stop his day trading, nor stem the losses.
In March, according to his sister-in-law, Barton told Gary Argo that he had tapped the children's trust fund and that he was facing a repayment deadline.
If he missed it, he thought he would go to jail.
Later, the Argos said, Barton told them he had obtained the money and met the repayment deadline.
Shortly afterward, Barton left All-Tech Investment Group, the first place he had traded, and went to Momentum Securities Inc.
He eventually gunned down five people at All-Tech, including four traders, before going across Piedmont Road to Momentum, where he killed four more.
The size of Barton's debts at the trading offices could not be verified, because such trading information is not public record.
But the Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, has reported that Barton lost $400,000 at All-Tech before leaving there in April.
Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts, according to Atlanta police.
Police declined to say how much money Barton had borrowed from his colleagues.
In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the Buckhead shooting rampage before Barton fled and killed himself when cornered by police in Cobb County.
He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager, purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.
``He had no money,'' Walden said Wednesday.
``He had no intention of going to pay off his debt he knew exactly what he was going to do over there'' Witnesses told police that the Momentum manager was not available when Barton first arrived.
Barton waited about 25 minutes, exchanging small talk with other traders in the room, and then could wait no longer.
``People said he began shutting the blinds in the office,'' Walden said.
``Then he closed one of the doors in the office.
He turned around and whipped out two guns, one in each hand.''
The gunfire was not erratic or ill-planned.
``This wasn't a shooting spree,'' Walden said.
``His shots were intentional.
Everyone was shot at close range.
Some people had gone under their desks and he just stepped up to them and fired.''
Said Atlanta homicide commander Lt. Tony Biello.
``He was proficient with his firearms and he was methodical.''
