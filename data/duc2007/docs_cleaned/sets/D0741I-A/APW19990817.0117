The widow of a man murdered by Mark O. Barton during his shooting spree last month at two day-trading firms has filed the first lawsuit stemming from the crimes.
Gulshan Harjee, wife of victim Dean Delawalla, sued the All-Tech Investment Group, Barton's estate, the owners of the building where All-Tech's Atlanta office is located and the building's security company.
Delawalla, 52, an All-Tech customer, was trading at the office when Barton opened fire.
Among other allegations, the suit filed Friday claims All-Tech negligently failed to supervise Barton and to protect him from large financial losses that may have prompted the shootings.
The ``murderous acts ... were reasonably foreseeable'' by company officials, it says.
Barton, a former chemist who reportedly lost as much as $450,000 while trading at All-Tech and Momentum Securities in the last year, killed nine people and wounded 13 others at the two companies' Atlanta offices on July 29.
Hours later, he committed suicide.
Prior to the attacks, Barton also killed his wife and two children, authorities say.
Michael Weinstock, Ms. Harjee's attorney, said All-Tech had a responsibility to check the backgrounds of its day traders and should have discovered that Barton was a ``volatile individual.''
``They're creating a pressure environment that, in this case, with the pressure environment on top of a volatile individual ... it basically exacerbates a dangerous circumstance,'' Weinstock said Tuesday.
Linda Lerner, an attorney for Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.
The suit also said Barton Protective Services, which is not related to Mark Barton, failed to provide adequate security in All-Tech's office building.
It also seeks compensation from Barton's estate and the building's owner.
