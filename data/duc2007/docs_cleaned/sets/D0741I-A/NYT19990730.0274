The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days, ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he used.
Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of market speculation'' were to blame.
``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member of the Lakeside Trading Club.
``It was only a matter of time before someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and took it out on innocent victims.''
However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that Barton had as all traders do signed documents saying he understood the risk.
``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made were his own,'' said Lee.
Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second ahead of the direction of a stock price.
Day-traders feed off a stock's volatile intraday movement.
The shares most often traded are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market, which processes trades electronically.
Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
These companies provide staff to help the traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to trade.
The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to take advantage of spikes in the prices.
At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers do.
Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a particular stock to sell to customers.
They buy or sell stock to keep an orderly market.
Watching the market makers, lets traders like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public.
That step might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose money in their first few months, Borquin said.
The ones who last a year tend to make a living, he said.
Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one man would stain an industry.
``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very little.
This guy was just a lunatic.
He could have been a mechanic or a doctor.
What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader.''
How difficult is day-trading?
Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
They don't.
Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on SP futures.
The reason?
The prices of these tradeable futures contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite closely.
When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal.
Successful day traders rarely bet against this market gauge.
They buy shares when the futures suggest the market will rise.
Sometimes they're right.
Sometimes they're wrong.
What is the attraction of day trading?
Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close at $125.38.
That day trader could have made as much as $400.
What are the risks of day-trading?
Enormous.
Investing is inherently risky.
Day-trading is extreme investing and can be extremely risky.
Doing it without proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin (with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of unexpected market events.
