former stock trader even fears going to the bank, worried that someone will shoot him again.
One year ago, they faced unimaginable violence; today, and perhaps forever, unfathomable sadness.
All because of Mark Barton.
On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history.
During the previous two days, he had bludgeoned his wife and his two children.
Later, as police surrounded his green minivan, Barton committed suicide.
At the end, 13 people were dead.
Another 13 were wounded.
The day-trading offices Momentum Securities Inc. and All-Tech Investment Group have reopened; fresh paint, wallpaper and carpet cover the remnants of the carnage.
Families of some victims have moved into new homes, trying to escape the memories.
Lawsuits have been filed, relationships have frayed, counseling and antidepressants have failed to eliminate the pain.
``Every time I pray and read my Bible, Kevin's kind of talking to me,'' Buddy Dial, a former All-Pro football player, said of his slain son.
``It's been very difficult, losing Kevin.''
Some who lived through the day's horror, directly or indirectly, say they've accepted what happened, and even gotten over their anger.
Some won't talk about it at all, and others say they've simply tried to put the event out of their minds.
``My whole stance is, it's still in the past,'' said Scott Manspeaker, back to work as a manager at All-Tech after nearly bleeding to death from two gunshot wounds.
``We're over it.''
That's what I do with bad things.''
Still others have analyzed and reanalyzed everything that happened.
They've tried to reconstruct every moment of the tragedy, endlessly seeking some truth that will help it all make sense.
What they find, though, are others asking the same question: Why?
``Every week I or somebody I know runs into somebody who was touched by that incident,'' said Nell Jones, who eluded a bullet from Barton but witnessed his rampage at All-Tech.
``It's absolutely mind-boggling that one person could create that much sorrow.
One person.''
Marie Quinn wonders about Barton.
Why didn't he just kill himself that day in Atlanta?
Why did he have to take so many with him?
And why her husband, Edward?
``Even though I go to counseling, I don't think I'll ever be able to let it all out.''
Nights are the hardest.
``After he was killed, I waited a long, long time to change the sheets because they smelled like him.''
Her salvation, she said, has been her first grandson, Bryce.
He was born three months before her husband was killed, and the family treasures its photographs of grandfather and grandson.
``God took an angel,'' she said, ``and, at the same time, gave us an angel.''
Like others who became widows last July 29, Roya Havash has suffered from depression.
Medication has helped, she said, but it hasn't lessened her feeling that her husband, Jamshid, wasn't supposed to be at All-Tech that day.
In her husband's personal effects she found a ticket from the toll booth on Ga. 400 near the shooting scene.
He had passed through just 45 minutes before he was killed.
``We're Muslim.
The Quran said that when your time comes, you have to go.
There's nothing you can do about it.
In a way, I think it was his time.
But it was too soon.''
Gulshan Harjee thinks of what her husband, Dean Delawalla, has missed the past 12 months.
Their son, Faisal, turned 16 and learned to drive.
Soon he'll start visiting colleges.
Their daughter, Shahla, turns 5 on Friday.
Her birthday will always fall the day before the anniversary of her father's death.
``That's the one thing we'll live with every year,'' Harjee said.
``We need to reclaim the sadness of that day .
Debra Tenenbaum's three children have given her strength to deal with the loss of her husband, Allen.
But as they grow, she said, she realizes how much time has passed without her husband.
One recent evening, her 4-year-old son, Scott, jumped up from the dinner table.
The last thing Kathleen Van Camp ever saw was Barton's face.
She was sitting in an office at All-Tech when Barton came in, pulled out two handguns and began firing.
He shot her twice once in the chest, once in the head.
Immediately, her world went dark.
In the year since, Van Camp said, she has undergone ``many surgeries,'' and she expects more.
But she does not expect to regain her sight.
``I'm weary,'' she said.
She takes classes at the Center for the Visually Impaired.
She visits friends, dines out occasionally, follows the stock market, goes to doctors' appointments.
``That's pretty much it,'' she said.
Before the shooting, Van Camp enjoyed her independence.
Now she relies on her husband of 13 years, Michael Sovereign, and others to take her everywhere.
That loss of freedom, she said, has been the hardest adjustment.
The only evidence of former day trader Sang Yoon's wound is a scar along his lower left forearm.
But he, too, has lost his freedom.
When he takes deposits from his dry cleaning business to the bank, he said, he fears someone will shoot him for his money.
In a crowd a restaurant, a ballgame he is afraid a shooting will erupt.
During a recent power outage at his business, when he heard sounds from an electric pole, he thought they were shots.
He took the rest of the day off.
At home, he said, his temper is short.
``My wife says I've changed,'' he said.
``When my baby is crying, I used to take care of that.
But now I get angry.''
Sometimes, he feels a tickling sensation along his scar.
Pointing to his heart, he said, ``I'm still uncomfortable.''
Helen Brown counted on her son, Russell.
When her husband and oldest son had cancer, it was Russell who nursed them.
And when something needed repairing at her home in Florida, it was Russell who took care of it.
Since Russell was killed at Momentum, Brown has sold her house.
``Everywhere I looked, I saw Russ,'' said Brown, who now lives near her daughter in Orlando.
``He was the project guy.
He came down every other month to fix things around here for me.''
She never wants to visit Atlanta again, not even for a memorial service July 30 for Barton's victims.
Not even to see her son's fiancee of eight years, Patti Balon.
The Brown family has broken its ties with Balon after a disagreement over how to disperse Russell's ashes.
The family insisted that she send them everything of Russell's his clothes, furniture, ashes.
Balon and the Brown family no longer speak to one another.
Balon described the estrangement as unfortunate.
She said she's still grieving, but is working 70-hour weeks as a diversion.
Almost every day, Rene Swanson thinks about what she discovered at Barton's apartment in Stockbridge.
Still, her voice breaks when she talks about it.
``There are no words to describe it,'' said Swanson, a detective with Henry County police.
``When I went in there, it was the worst thing I would ever want to see.''
Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton's children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Michelle, and their stepmother, Leigh Ann Barton.
All three had been beaten to death with a hammer.
Barton admitted to the crimes in a suicide note he left in the living room.
Swanson said she can't come to terms with the ritualistic way Barton killed his children, then washed and combed their hair, dressed them in pajamas, tucked them into bed and surrounded them with their prized possessions.
Beside Matthew he placed a Swiss army knife, Boy Scout patches and Pokemon trading cards; beside Michelle, a doll with a pink dress and blond hair in pigtails.
``You could smell shampoo in their hair,'' Swanson said.
``In some sense, there had to be some kind of love there, too.''
Sorting through her emotions was made easier by a friendship forged out of the case with Bill Spivey, the children's grandfather.
Spivey believes his wife, Eloise, and Debra, his daughter and Barton's first wife, were murdered by Barton in 1993, a case which remains unsolved.
Spivey invited Swanson to lunch a few weeks after last year's killings.
This month, he asked Swanson, her husband and their children to join his family for a Fourth of July party.
``It was heartbreaking,'' said Swanson, who normally doesn't socialize with people she meets on her job.
``Michelle and Matthew if things were different, it would have been them playing in the pool.''
Spivey doesn't like to talk about the killings.
And he avoids the cemetery where his grandchildren, their mother and his wife are buried alongside one another.
Visiting the grave sites, he said, is too painful.
``All of us have lost our loved ones,'' Spivey said.
``If we can put this behind us and go on and try to have a constructive life, we would all be better off.''
Alyce Wenzel has tried to move on.
But sometimes, just driving the car on an errand, she bursts into tears, remembering her son, Scott Webb.
``Scottie never had a chance to get married or have children, and he loved children,'' Wenzel said.
``I'll just have to learn to take it day by day.
God doesn't give you more than you can handle.
Nell Jones has tried to put the shootings behind her, too.
She returned to day trading for a while, but only as a form of therapy.
Being around others who had lived through the killings helped her regain control of her emotions.
Now, though, she mostly stays at home, close to her family, seeking clarity about life trying, she said, to filter out the ``background noise.''
She is haunted by visions of what she witnessed: ``These lovely, innocent people .
``They were there, and they were gone,'' she said.
``If I had been killed, what would I have left behind?
What would I have left undone and unsaid?
And can I look around and do them now?''
One victim especially occupies her thoughts: Vadewattee Muralidhara, over whose body she stepped when she emerged from a closet where she hid during part of Barton's shooting spree.
Muralidhara's husband is haunted, too.
``She was not keen on day trading,'' Kesturkoppal Muralidhara said.
``It was I who was interested.
He recently moved to a new house, hoping to leave behind happy memories that now seem so painful.
But his wife's clothes hang in his new closet.
When he closes his eyes, he sees his wife in the dress she wore when she died.
He sees her gazing at him from the passenger side of his car, undressing by the bed they shared for 22 years, cooking the evening meal.
``My children come home and sit around,'' he said.
`Daddy, where is the food?'
`Look,' I say, `I cannot cook.
Let's go out and eat.'
They want to sit down at a table and all eat together.
We have not done that in almost a year now.
Not one time.
That happiness, I don't think, will ever come back to me.''
Thirty days before the anniversary of a death, Hindus believe, the soul ascends to heaven.
So 11 months after Barton killed her with a bullet to the head, Vadewattee Muralidhara's ashes were scattered in the sea.
Finally, her husband said, this would bring ``peace to her soul.''
