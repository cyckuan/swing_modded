Leigh Ann Barton's grandmother, Pauline Vandiver, 78, sat with family in the antique-packed living room of her home in Macon, Ga., remembering the soft-spoken woman who was killed by a man they never quite trusted.
As family and friends delivered foil-wrapped banana bread and a fruit basket tied with a yellow ribbon, the Vandivers struggled with whether they should have foreseen the carnage.
Ginger Lewis, Leigh Ann Barton's cousin, said the whole family was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey.
Several family members, including Lewis, thought he must have done it.
He didn't talk the whole time.
Not one word.''
According to family members, Joe Vandiver told his daughter outright that he believed Mark Barton was guilty of the crimes.
Leigh Ann insisted he wasn't, family members said.
On Saturday, they laughed as they told stories about Leigh Ann sucking her thumb as a little girl, and they fought back tears as Vandiver remembered a gift basket of lavender goodies Leigh Ann brought for what turned out to be her last visit home Mother's Day.
They described her as lady-like with a Christian school background.
And she never forgot a family event.
But they also remembered a woman torn between a husband she wanted to leave and the children she wanted to stay with.
Leigh Ann didn't want to have children, but she came to love Mark Barton's son and daughter like they were her own, her grandmother said.
``Those kids thought more of her than they did him,'' great-uncle Larry Vandiver said of Leigh Ann, 27, and Mark Barton, 44.
``They called her Momma.''
``She said, `If I ever leave Mark I'm going to take these kids,''' Pauline Vandiver recalled her granddaughter saying during the Mothers' Day trip.
In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge apartment.
Barton said he killed his two children, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the next evening.
One day later, he went on a shooting spree through two Buckhead office buildings.
Leigh Ann Barton's family learned with television viewers that she and the children were dead.
They will bury her at 1 p.m. today in Macon.
``Reality's setting in since they got the body home,'' said Vandiver.
Meanwhile, with metro Atlantans trying to cope with the latest blast of violence, the sad parade of funerals and memorials continued.
Pastors and rabbis were trying to draw some sense from these tragic events.
And many people were gathering for comfort, healing and reflection on one man's bizarre behavior.
On Saturday, the friends and family of Dean Delawalla, 52, gathered for his funeral services at the National Cremation Society Memorial Center in Lilburn.
The former attorney and businessman, a devout Muslim, had been preparing for his daughter Shahala's birthday when he was killed in the storm of bullets.
More than 1,000 people attended his funeral Friday.
The memorial service will be at noon today at Congregation Or VeShalom, where Tenenbaum served as president.
His chair at the pulpit will be covered for at least a month in his memory, said Jack Arogeti, vice president.
``Goodness was his nature,'' Arogeti said.
The immense outpouring of sympathy for the nine people shot to death prompted the scheduling of a memorial service Saturday at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead.
Afterward, a walk was planned down Piedmont Road to the two office buildings Securities Centre and the Piedmont Center where the killings occurred.
Funeral arrangements for Barton himself have been kept secret by the family.
At the Henry County apartment where Barton killed his wife and two children, mourners placed a half-dozen small flower bouquets at the front door.
``Rest in Peace, Leigh Ann, Matthew and Michelle,'' read a note left in a hanging basket outside.
``May God be with You,'' was the inscription on a torn peace of paper in a potted plant.
During the day, the only activity inside the apartment was cleanup by a crime scene crew.
Three employees of Metro Crime Scene Disposal spent three hours removing pillows and blankets.
They also cut out sections of mattresses and carpet for transportation to medical incinerators.
``There was very little bloodshed'' at the apartment, said company representative Gordy Powell.
He said the scene was consistent with Barton's note describing how he beat the children unconscious, then drowned them.
He described the apartment as a neat, ``middle-income family setting'' that reflected a woman's taste in ``country decor.''
Among the possessions left behind, to be claimed by family members, were some Happy Meals toys.
Neighbors said things are returning to normal at the apartment complex, as the numbers of sightseers and camera crews dwindled.
At a gas station a mile from the Stockbridge apartment, a clerk who recognized Barton from news photos said he would frequently buy $1 or $2 worth of gas and complain in a serious tone that the station's prices were too high.
Some metro Atlanta religious leaders said they would discuss the slayings in services today.
The Rev.
Randy Stamper, considering what he may tell his assembly at Faith Free Full Gospel Church in Buford, commented on Barton: ``Some people seem to lose all hope, and they don't have any major foundation in life but money.
When he lost that, he lost it all.''
Meanwhile, Atlanta's grief reached to Littleton, Colo., where four months earlier 13 people were killed at Columbine High School.
The two gun-crazed students, like Barton, also committed suicide.
``It's one sickening tragedy after another,'' said Rick Castaldo, who moved with his second wife across the country to be with his 17-year-old son, Richard, left paralyzed from the Columbine attack.
Even some people in the Denver area whose families were not directly affected by the Columbine shootings said a familiar wave of disbelief washed over them Thursday.
``It's happening all over again in Atlanta and we still have no answers in Littleton,'' said Katryn Stienmark, who works for St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church, the Littleton church where many families and students sought solace and several of the slain were eulogized.
``We're thinking, `My God!'''
In the meantime, 10 people injured in the shootings remain hospitalized, some in critical condition in intensive care units.
One wounded victim was released from the hospital Saturday.
Derek Schimming, a branch manager for All-Tech, said the four All-Tech employees still in the hospital are ``progressing.
They're still not out of the woods, but they're doing better.''
