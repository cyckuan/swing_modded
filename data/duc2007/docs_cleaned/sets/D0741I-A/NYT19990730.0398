The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage.
``I'm sure the details don't matter.
There is no excuse, no good reason.
If they could I wouldn't want them to.
In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned his two children the following day.
``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer, chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.
``He went to pains to conceal the body so you can't help but think the kids were in and out during that time,'' Mercer said.
Barton's wife was found in a closet in the apartment home.
Barton walked Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms where he traded and fired randomly at traders and employees.
Nine died and 13 were wounded.
Hours later, he killed himself as police pulled over his van.
The letter indicates he killed his children from his first marriage, Matthew, 11, and Michelle, 8, to save them from a painful existence.
Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993.
Although Barton was considered the prime suspect, he was never charged in that case and denied any involvement in the letter he left.
The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his wife's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday.
He gave no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife and the people at the companies for his depression.
Officials at one of the businesses, Momentum Securities, said Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning June 9, and lost $105,000.
The other business, All-Tech Investment Group, would not release his trading history there.
Barton made no reference to his trading in the letter but mentioned his plan to kill others twice.
You should kill me if you can,'' he wrote.
The letter apparently was signed by Barton and contained names and numbers of three people his mother, Gladys Barton; his children's maternal grandfather, Bill Spivey; and an attorney, Joe Fowler.
At first authorities thought the three might be intended targets but later decided they were just people to contact about the deaths.
After the shootings, Barton, 44, shot himself to death in his minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth, just north of Atlanta.
The letter was found Thursday night lying on a coffee table in the living room of Barton's estranged wife's apartment in Stockbridge, about 30 miles south of Atlanta.
Three handwritten notes also were found on each of the bodies.
Each contained two sentences describing his love for each and asking someone to take care of them.
Copies of the letter were not released, but Mercer read the letter to reporters Friday.
``This letter was left in a very obvious place,'' Mercer said.
``We didn't have to do any searching.
They (the letter and notes with each body) were very visible from the time you walked in.''
The printed letter was addressed ``To Whom It May Concern.''
It began with a matter-of-fact tone: ``Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket.
Barton wrote of the similarities between the deaths and those of his first wife of 15 years, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59.
They were hacked to death six years ago in a camper at Lake Weiss, Ala. ``However I deny killing her and her mother.
There is no reason for me to lie now,'' Barton wrote.
``It just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.
``There was little pain.
All of them were dead in less than five minutes.
Words cannot tell the agony.
Why did I?''
Barton wrote only that he had ``been dying since October'' and since then had terrifying dreams he could no longer live with.
The letter never explained what caused the dreams or his sense of hopelessness.
He only wrote: ``It has taken its toll.
The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.
No mother, no father, no relatives.
``The fears of the father are transferred to the son.
It was from my father to me and from me to my son.
He already had it and now to be left alone, I had to take him with me.''
The bodies of the children were found in the other bedroom of the two-bedroom apartment.
Each was lying in a separate bed with blankets and bed coverings pulled up to their faces.
``There wasn't any part of the body aside from just a square portion of their face visible,'' Mercer said.
``It was almost like they were sleeping.
There was certainly not any visible blood that I saw... We saw some blood splatters on the wall, but it also appeared to be this individual went to some extreme in terms of trying to clean up the mess.''
The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of shrine in tribute to each.
Next to Matthew's body was a video game, and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.
She really couldn't help it, and I love her so much anyway.''
Several draft versions of the letter were found on the computer in the home, Mercer said.
That Barton's depression led him to kill at home and the workplace is unusual, said John Vincent, a professor of psychology at the University of Houston.
``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said.
``This pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker.''
Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at his expense.
``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said.
Despite the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying, authorities there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and Eloise Spivey to be closed now.
Barton had taken out a $600,000 in life insurance on his first wife before her death and eventually settled with the insurance company for $450,000, according to federal court records obtained by The Associated Press.
About $150,000 was to be held in trust for his children.
After legal fees, Barton was left with $194,000.
The AP also reported that Barton lived in Texarkana, Texas, in the late 1980s and was fired from his job as president of TLC Manufacturing after a burglary investigation.
One of the handguns Barton used in the spree, a Colt .45-caliber, was traced to a North Texas gun dealer, police said, and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983.
Barton registered the other, a 9 mm Glock, in 1993.
With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton's shooting spree in Atlanta, Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities would continue to search for a motive.
``There will be a number of people for a long period of time trying to put the pieces to the puzzle together to find out why it is that Mr. Barton was provoked to the extent that he was, that he felt the need to take out as many people as he did,'' Mercer said.
