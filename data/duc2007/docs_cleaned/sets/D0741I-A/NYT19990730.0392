It was Tuesday afternoon at the Bristol Green apartments in Stockbridge, and Travis Holmes, 14, saw Barton and his son and struck up a conversation with them.
Travis is a Scout, so everyone had something in common.
They talked about merit badges.
They talked about camp.
Travis saw no signs that Barton was about to take the first steps on a terrifying journey that would devestate families, challenge a city's sense of security and rivet the nation with its intimate brutality and horrific randomness.
But another person who saw him Tuesday noticed that something was wrong.
`Something's weird' ``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese remembers thinking when Barton, a troop leader, came to pick up her grandsonwho was friends with Barton's son.
Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh Ann.
Mrs. Barton had moved Matthew and his 7-year-old sister Elizabeth Mychelle to a Stockbridge apartment.
Sometimes, Mrs. DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange.
She chalked it up to their closeness.
There was no way for Travis to know on Tuesday afternoon that he was chatting with a man who, by his own admission, was consumed with hatred.
Or that Mark Barton would cause so much anguish and grief in the next three days, Barton's last three days on earth.
Hours after the ordinary conversation about Scouts, however, Barton killed his wife with a hammer and stuffed her body in a bedroom closet.
The next morning and afternoon, Barton stayed in the apartment with his 11-year-old Matthew, and his daughter, 8-year-old Mychelle, said Capt.
Jim Simmons of the Henry County Police Department.
On Wednesday night, Barton smashed the hammer into his children and then held them down in a bathtub to make sure they were dead.
Authorities said he tidied up, put the kids back in bed and tucked them in.
They said he left a video game on Matthew's body and a stuffed toy on Mychelle's body.
Now he was alone in an apartment with three bodies.
He booted up a home computer and started typing a note for the police.
He addressed it ``To Whom It May Concern'' and dated it Thursday, July 29, at 6:38 a.m. ``I don't plan to live very much longer,'' he said, ``just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction.''
Trading day got worse About eight hours later, just before 2:30 p.m. Thursday, Barton strolled into the offices of Momentum Securities Inc., a day-trading firm on the third floor of a Buckhead office building.
It's a place where people sit in front of computers to gamble on the stock market, hoping for instant gains.
He had traded many times before in this office and was known to the people who worked there.
They exchanged pleasantries.
Barton told them he wanted to make a few transactions.
He chatted for a minute or two longer.
Police later said he made a chilling remark: ``It's a bad trading day and it's about to get worse.''
Suddenly Barton whipped out two pistols.
``He then shot both guns at the same time, `` Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said Friday afternoon.
The hunt begins Police got the first call about the gunfire at Momentum's third floor office at 2:56 p.m. A woman told 911 dispatchers that a man had come into the office and shot people.
Two minutes later, at 2:58 p.m., a man sounding more urgent told police four people were dead at Momentum.
The first Atlanta police officer arrived at the office at 3 p.m., Harvard said.
Blood was everywhere.
``He was immediately told that four people were dead and he went up to Suite 310,'' Harvard said.
``He called for back-up and other officers arrived within seconds.''
As the officers began canvassing the office, stepping carefully over the victims, they heard voices coming from a smaller room just a few feet from where the slain victims lay.
``The officers found several people huddled in the smaller room, they had gone in there to hide,'' Harvard said.
``One of the people had thrown a computer out the window to attract the attrention of someone on the street.
``One of the women in the room shouted out, 'Mark Barton shot us!'
While the cops began combing through the other offices on the third floor, another officer circled his motorcycle on Piedmont Road below.
Suddeny shots rang out at a complex of other office building across the street.
It was 3:07 p.m.
Bodies are everywhere Other officers arrived and were told the shots were coming from Suite 215 in building eight of the Piedmont Center, an office complex made up of 11 buildings.
The officers went inside and saw five people slumped over their computer terminals.
Several others were hurt.
Barton is missing It was 3:15 p.m. Barton was nowhere in sight and the officers began their thorough search for the shooter throughout Piedmont Center.
Ambulances flooded Piedmont Road.
Dispatchers had alerted medical personnel to expect several victims, both dead and wounded.
But paramedics said what they found was far worse than what they had imagined.
``We see shootings all the time, they almost seen routine,'' said Reginald McCoy, a paramedic with Grady Memorial Hospital.
``But I've never seen anything like that ... the volume.
It was utter chaos.''
Meanwhile, 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta, Miles South, the manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex in Stockbridge was thinking about the quiet apartment unit in building 1300.
The rent was late, and he wondered what was up.
He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in.
Notes on the bodies After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.
Both Matthew and Elizabeth Mychelle were dead, apparently from blows to the head.
They lay in their beds, all but their faces covered.
Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and similarly covered, with another scribbled note.
In the living room was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer Barton so loved.
Barton, meanwhile, was across the city.
Escape in the woods?
At about 3:30 p.m., Lori Woodward and a handful of employees at the Ivy Place Buildingspotted a man wearing a red shirt and khaki pants, running south on Piedmont Road toward the Lenox Road intersection.
Woodard and her colleagues had learned from radio and TV news that police were looking for a shooter wearing those clothes.
``We had no idea he had just shot the people at Piedmont center,'' Woodard said.
``We watched him because he looked strange, He was carrying, like, a knapsack on his back and he was acting nervous.
Woodard said the man ran along the Buckhead Loop in the direction of Phipps Plaza on Lenox Road.
He stopped short however when he spotted an Atlanta police cruiser rolling his way, Woodard said.
``At that point he looked around and then walked up the driveway of a building that's under construction at the corner of Piedmont and Lenox,'' Woodard said.
``He kept looking around and looking over his shoulder.
He noticed two more officers at the top of the driveway, he turned around walked back to the street and then ran into a patch of woods.
We never saw him after that.''
Officers swarm the buildings For hours, officers with shotguns searched the parking decks at Piedmont Center and several office buildings.
Employees remained locked in their offices because officers did not know whether the killer was still around.
Police dogs sniffed the bushes.
And FBI agents dressed for war searched the area along Piemont Road.
Four hours passed before authorities heard from someone who had seen Barton.
Security officers at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw, about 20 miles from Buckhead, saw Barton's unoccupied van in the mall lot about 7:40 p.m. About the same time, a woman who'd been shopping at Rich's approached her parked car.
Barton walked toward her.
He had a black bag that hung over the shoulder of his neatly pressed blue short-sleeve shirt.
``Don't scream or I'll shoot you,'' he said, according to a police report.
The woman backed away.
``Don't run or I'll shoot you,'' he said.
She ran.
He did not shoot.
Looming large in a minivan Mannon Smith, who was also at the mall, said she saw Barton in the parking lot and recognized him as the suspect in the deadliest mass murder in Georgia history.
``It was this totally, totally freakish thing,'' Smith said.
You pull up behind a car and here was this guy everone is looking for.
Nobody expected him in Kennesaw. ''
At 6-foot, 4-inches tall, Barton loomed large in the mini-van, Smith said.
She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911.
Operaters at first were skeptical, but eventually believed Smith when she described the van and read off the license plate.
Smith said she briefly followed Barton until he turned onto Barrett Parkway.
He turned right toward I-75.
She turned left.
Smith said she thought briefly about tailing Barton but quickly decided to leave that up to the professionals.
``He had just killed 12 people,'' Smith said.
Meanwhile, mall officials had alerted police.
Officers all over the northern part of Cobb County were looking for the minivan.
Cobb County Police Officer Huel Clements was on I-75 when he saw a minivan matching the description of Barton's minivan.
He relayed the tag number by radio to a dispatcher.
The dispatcher confirmed his suspicion: it was Barton's minivan.
He followed Barton, keeping a safe distance at first so as not to tip off Barton that he was being followed.
He also told fellow officers by radio what he had discovered.
On the run About 7:50 p.m., as the day continued its slow summer surrender to evening, Barton turned off the interstate onto Ga. 92 in Acworth.
``My main cocern was keeping survelliance and waiting for backup,'' Clements said Friday, still wearing the black stripe across his badge to honor the two Cobb officers who were killed in the line of duty last weekend.
Barton passed a service station on his left and turned right just past a McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
Then he turned left and eased into a BP gasoline station.
Officer Clements, still behind Barton, turned on his blue lights.
Then his siren sounded for a second or two.
Dane Pritchett, 14, saw what happened next.
She was in the backseat of a car in the McDonald's parking lot, waiting for her brother and his girlfriend to bring her a fish filet sandwich and French Fries.
She said Barton slowed at the gas pumps, as if he was going to stop, but then pulled up about 35 feet to a spot between the pumps and the BP Car Wash.
Suddenly an Acworth police cruiser whipped into the gas station parking lot and stopped in front of the minivan.
Officer Clements, behind Barton's minivan, leapt out of his car, drew his gun and crouched behind the door of his patrol car.
Pritchett said he trained his gun on the minivan and shouted at its driver.
``He was yelling `Get out!
Get out!'''
Pritchett said.
Within seconds, Cpl.
Curtis Endicott of the Acworth Police Department had whipped his patrol car into the BP parking lot to block a possible escape route for Barton.
As Endicott threw open his door of his police car, Barton raised a 9mm pistol to one side of his head and a .45 caliber pistol to the other.
``We heard a muffled sound,'' Pritchett said, ``and his head fell against the steering wheel.''
It was about 7:55 p.m. Several of the six Acworth police officers on duty had arrived by this time.
They bounded out of their patrol cars and pointed their guns at the van.
One of the officers walked tensely towards the driver's side door.
``He walked over and with one hand slung the door open and then backed off,'' Pritchett said.
Jim Fowler, the clerk at the Amoco service station across the street, said he could tell the danger had passed by watching the officers.
``They all just started holstering their guns,'' he said.
