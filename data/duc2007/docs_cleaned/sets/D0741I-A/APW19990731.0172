Nothing in the second building where Mark Barton opened fire was going to stop him from killing.
Not the unmonitored video cameras, not the unarmed security guard, and especially not the police across the street.
Besides trying to understand why Barton killed his family and then nine people at two Atlanta brokerages, authorities spent Friday assessing how Barton traversed one of the city's busiest thoroughfares unimpeded to continue his rampage.
He then fled, spurring a five-hour manhunt.
``We don't know how he got away,'' said Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard.
``We did everything exactly as it should have been done, and the officers did an excellent job, especially when it came to response time.''
Barton's first stop was Securities Centre, which houses Momentum Securities, a day-trading firm where the 44-year-old had traded.
``Mr. Barton was a regular client, and one of those people who would have never been stopped,'' said Magnes Welsh, spokeswoman for Jones Lang Lasalle, the Chicago firm that manages Security Centre.
``There was nothing unusual about his arrival at all.''
The seven-story building features unarmed guards at the entrance, while customers and employees come and go at will during regular office hours.
The same is true at Barton's second stop, Perimeter Center, another seven-story building.
Ms. Harvard said Barton loitered at Securities Centre for about 30 minutes before drawing his guns.
She said witnesses recalled him saying ``It's a bad trading day, and it's going to get worse.''
Four died after Barton opened fire.
He then crossed Piedmont Avenue, one of Atlanta's main north-south arteries.
Momentum Securities is on the third floor, but other workers in the building weren't surprised he was able to get out so quickly.
``There are four elevators and they come pretty quick,'' said Beth Lavender, a client service specialist for Financial Development Corp., a floor below the shooting.
``And there are two doors in and out, so he probably was able to get out fast.''
Authorities responded to the first call within four minutes, but then a backup officer heard shots across the street.
By the time he arrived, Barton was gone.
But police, thinking he was still inside, began a painstaking search of the complex.
``You've got to remember that it was the end of the business day,'' Ms. Harvard said.
``And we are talking about Piedmont Avenue, one of the busiest streets of the city.
There were a lot of people coming and going.''
Barton purchased the Glock at a store in Warner Robins in 1993 and the HR revolver at a pawn shop in South Carolina in 1976, said a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The .45, with which Barton later committed suicide, was purchased by a gun dealer in Texas in 1983, but it was unclear how Barton got it.
And the Raven was bought at an unspecified Georgia pawn shop in 1992, but not by Barton.
The identity of the previous owner was not disclosed.
