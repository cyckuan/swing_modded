He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his first wife's death.
As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C. ``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented.''
Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday the day he went home and killed his wife.
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as ``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his children were suffering and hurting as well.''
From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried to display.
It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather unremarkable childhood.
An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11.
After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out.
Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
They were married May 5, 1979.
Soon they were living in Atlanta.
That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue, vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company, National Service Industries.
From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives followed a rocky path.
In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds.
By 1988, he had been named TLC's president.
He made as much as $86,000 a year and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
But two years later, he was fired.
In a deposition, Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business.
But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept. 25, 1990, and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company.
Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said.
After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc., in July 1990.
But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year.
In January 1992, after resigning from a raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company, now known as Lintech International.
With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
She married David Lang a month after starting work, in February 1993.
By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton testified.
Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to leave her husband.
Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany him to Panama City.
The trip was to take place the weekend after Labor Day the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were killed.
Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama.
They had been hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade.
Danny Edgar Smith, an investigator with the district attorney's office that covers Cedar Grove, Ala., where Debra and her mother were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer, since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of the murders.
He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and home.
Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing.
This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends.
During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by himself, he testified.
That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed.
He played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa, awoke during the night and headed to bed.
In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies $600,000 for him, $600,000 for her.
Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his own.
``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified.
``And she wanted the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a smaller amount.''
But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's story.
Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co. of Nebraska and Primerica Life Co., took Barton to court.
Lawyers for Investors Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life insurance policy.
Come on.''
Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in September 1997.
The company paid out $450,000 as part of a settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his lawyers.
Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost $66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years before from Primerica, according to court records.
In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only Barton could have been guilty.
But the case never went to a grand jury for indictment.
Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday, to warn her that she might be next.
``The lifestyle that he had indicated that he needed a young, sexy wife to maintain the status quo.
That's what he felt like he needed.
Barton and Lang both resigned from Lomas in October 1994.
The following May 26, they were married in Clayton County.
In the meantime, Barton had taken a sales job with Alchem Chemical Co. in Atlanta.
Not long after he joined the company, said general manager Chuck Matthews, co-workers began hearing rumors about Barton's suspected role in his wife's death.
``This has always been on the back of everybody's minds,'' Matthews said.
In mid-1997, Barton left Alchem and went to work for Micro-Blend Chemical Co.
In March, the company filed court papers in Clayton County Superior Court over a debt by Barton, records show.
By early 1999, Barton ventured out of the chemical industry for the first time in his career, joining the volatile world of day trading in the stock market.
He opened an account at the Atlanta office of Momentum Securities Inc. on May 13.
At the time, he claimed a net worth of $750,000, with $250,000 in liquid assets.
His income from Micro-Blend, he said, was $85,000 a year.
His wife, he added, made $40,000.
He told company executives that he had seen their advertisement on the CNBC cable business-news network.
At Momentum, Barton enjoyed little of the success that other investors have experienced.
Between June 9 and last Tuesday, he lost $105,000, according to a letter that Momentum sent Friday to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On Thursday, with his children and wife laying dead in their apartment, Barton sat at the computer he had used to track stock prices and wrote a chilling confession that concluded, ``You should kill me if you can.''
Later, he met with his lawyer, Joseph H. Fowler of Douglasville, to attend to what Fowler on Friday described as ``routine will and estate issues.''
With stock prices falling, Barton drove his green minivan to the Buckhead secdtion of Atlanta.
He walked into Momentum's third-floor trading room and exchanged routine greetings with other traders and company employees.
``He made comments to the extent it was a bad trading day,'' said Harvard, the Atlanta police chief, ``and something to the effect that it was going to get worse.''
