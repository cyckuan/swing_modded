So now historians, who delight in drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round 30-year interval since the original bash.
Take those $4 bottles of water a sign of ``Commercialstock,'' as one festival-goer put it.
But you don't see people burning up trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills a close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or just plain old greed?
Has life become one big violent video game?
The reports of sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has.
Has media madness taken over?
Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home to watch this on TV.''
And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas mask.
But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it was wet then, dry now.
How does the poem go?
``Some say Woodstock will end in fire, some say in mud''?
Or something like that.
What now?
Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from the town that happens to bear that name?
Or will the turn of the millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?

Oh, how this society loves its sports stars!
It pays them in a single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year.
It puts them on towering pedestals.
It deifies them.
Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special.
The world's petty rules don't apply to me.''
Consider parking spaces for the handicapped.
Athletes, one might reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks.
Their physical prowess is so gosh!
But a group of football players at the University of California at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in their specialness.
Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped parking permits for the campus.
The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at all amused.
As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse, protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats must go.''
Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean six months in jail, so the players got off easy.
Each one was suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service, half of it with the Special Olympics.
That should get them in shape to jog across a parking lot.

44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before killing himself as the police tried to arrest him.
Another 12 people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds.
The police later discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district.
Officers finally caught up with him in nearby Cobb County.
In a note left near the bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction.''
He wrote that he regretted killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living without parents.
Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama.
The authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge him.
In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February were safely locked away on other charges.
But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four murders.
The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a suspect when he was interviewed in February.
