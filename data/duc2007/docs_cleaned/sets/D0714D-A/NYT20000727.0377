He was online, of course, when he electronically got the news from cnn.com that a federal judge was ordering Napster Inc. to shut down its Web site that has spawned millions of music trades on the Internet.
Deadline: midnight today.
The next address Uribe typed in was ``www.napster.com'' and there he stayed for about the next five hours, getting a steady stream of complimentary music.
``We found out immediately and we said, 'We've got to get on, we've got to get on, we've got to get all that we can right now,''' said Uribe.
In all, Uribe said he downloaded about 75 songs, from hip-hop artist Jay-Z to Colombian musician Carlos Vives, in anticipation of a possible Napster shutdown.
Not bad, said Uribe, who was at work as a computer systems engineer in Fort Lauderdale at the time.
``It allowed us to get a lot of stuff for free,'' he said of the site.
Napster's lawyers asked the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the order, arguing that the decision would bring down the company and force it to lay off its 40 employees within days.
Local punk-rockers, folk-lovers, classic-rock buffs they all sounded off about the judge's ruling and the future of music, and they got in some last-minute downloading as Napster's hours quickly dwindled Thursday.
Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site and to download their own tunes for nothing.
Users can also share music tastes with each other in chat rooms.
The site had increased traffic Thursday, but no specific numbers were available and no system problems were reported, said Tracy Mlakar, spokeswoman for San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster.
Noting that 70 million people were expected to be using Napster by year's end unless the service is halted, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said the San Mateo, Calif.-based company was encouraging ``wholesale infringing'' against industry copyrights and would likely lose at trial.
The Recording Industry Association of America sued Napster in December, accusing it of creating a musical black market online.
The association estimates that song-swapping via Napster by an estimated 20 million people worldwide has cost the music industry more than $300 million in lost sales.
The heavy metal band Metallica also sued.
``We're elated,'' Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said.
``Sharing is such a warm, cuddly, friendly word .
Founder Shawn Fanning, who started Napster (his nickname in high school, a reference to his ``nappy'' frizzy hair) last year while a student at Northeastern University in Boston, said in a short Webcast, ``We will keep fighting for Napster and for your right to share music over the Internet.''
All of this is a real drag to 15-year-old Jamie Warren.
Now, he said, how's he going to promote his band, Benjamin Distasteful and the Wumberlogs?
He'd hoped some free samples on Napster, a high-profile venue, could give the band a boost.
``Metallica started this whole stupid thing and complaining, but they have millions of dollars so I don't know why they have to complain about it,'' Warren said.
He said he'd downloaded several songs by Thursday afternoon since hearing the news, and he planned on getting a few more before it was too late.
Napster gives him access to hard-to-find songs you can't get from the radio or many record stores.
Like music from The Misfits and Discharge.
Maybe he'll use other sites that offer downloads, but he said he'd gotten used to Napster and was hesitant to turn elsewhere.
People familiar with the music industry locally said it was fruitless to try to stop the downloading of music, pointing to other sites like gnutella.wego.com and scour.com, which offer similar services.
``The genie was already out of the bottle anyway,'' said Steve Rullman, 32, who runs a locally based Web site thehoneycomb.com that lets users to listen to new bands of all types.
Thursday evening, Gnutella's file-sharing was down because of ``unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision,'' according to the Web site.
The Napster site was especially susceptible to a court ruling because the songs are listed on the site, unlike some other sites.
Area record vendors said the online downloading could actually help business by exposing listeners to music they otherwise wouldn't be interested in.
``It helps promote the band,'' said a manager at Downtown Books and CDs in Lake Worth, who goes by the name Kenny 5.
``They like the song (after hearing it online), they go out and buy the CD.''
But Michael Pruszynski, 32, who owns Music-X-Change in Jupiter, said that may be true for the near future only.
``If I have to look ahead, say, another five to ten years,'' he said, ``I would say the smart bet would be to get out of this business.''
