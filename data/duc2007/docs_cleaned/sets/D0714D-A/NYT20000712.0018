The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part of the hottest controversy in the music business, ensuring that the youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will continue to reshape the industry, at least for now.
After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of Internet music downloads, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``I think the courts can handle it.''
Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now.
The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood.
``In the end, things get sorted out and new offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,'' Leahy said.
``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle.''
The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers.
They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors.
The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' a free software that allows users to download music from each other's computers rather than a central server are inherently uncontrollable.
Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology.''
Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday, lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking, piracy and theft of artistic property.
Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress.
The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a lawsuit.
``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,'' Ulrich said.
Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.
And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other.
The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he ``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager advances.
``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he said.
In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement.
``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but Feinstein was undeterred.
``You could do the same thing with a book,'' she said.
``You could do the same thing with a movie.
You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server.''
Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs.
These horrible prophecies have not come true.
In every case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content producers.
Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the ``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20 million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow.''
Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually, Kan predicted.
Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City, agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance on physical distribution.
But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs 99 cents for a single track and $8.99 for an album it still pays artists and cannot compete with free music.
``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that ``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated and that Web sites get access to recordings.
