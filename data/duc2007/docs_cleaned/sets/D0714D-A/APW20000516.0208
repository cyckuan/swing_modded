Thousands of Metallica fans booted by online music sharing software company Napster Inc. for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000 MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the popular MP3 digital format.
If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's attorney, who disputed their claims.
''They're (the users) absolutely lying.
There's no question that they're lying,'' said attorney Howard King.
''Each and every one of them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads.''
Metallica sued the company last month for copyright infringement and racketeering, alleging that Napster's software encouraged users to freely trade the band's songs without permission.
Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were trading the band's tunes.
The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San Mateo two weeks ago.
Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client, rap artist Dr. Dre, to notify Napster on Wednesday of more than 200,000 users who illegally traded his music.
