This principle is as valid today as when the Constitution was written in 1787.
Congress and the courts need to adapt it to the Internet, which offers access to an extraordinary amount of information even as it provides opportunity to limit what people see, hear, and read.
Intense legal battles are being waged today over the use of MP3 technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in a compressed form.
Computer-users are able to amass collections of hundreds of songs on their PCs.
The recording industry might have embraced this technology as a new, more convenient way of getting music to its customers, but it has been slow to allow the release of material by well-known performers.
Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and Napster, have stepped into this vacuum.
The Recording Industry Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular material.
The association has a point about Napster.
This program, available at no cost on the Internet, allows anyone who signs up to share MP3 files with any other Napster members.
Thursday afternoon, 5,423 Napsterites were on line with 621,881 songs (many of them duplicates).
Some of the music came from aspiring artists eager to be heard, but most was by famous acts, who would much rather have fans buy their compact discs so they could collect royalties.
Needless to say, most famous performers have not given Napster or Napster members permission to run a song-sharing service.
MP3.com had a better idea.
It wanted to create a database of 80,000 popular CDs and allow access only to people who could prove electronically that they owned, or at least had physical possession of, the actual CD.
The Napster case is pending, but Judge Jed S. Rakoff in New York federal court ruled last month that the MP3.com plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections.
Both companies have since taken steps to reduce their legal exposure, but the larger issues remain.
Owners of CDs are not without rights.
Under the legal doctrine of ``fair use,'' first promulgated in 1840 and upheld repeatedly since then, people can make many uses of copyright material: using a portion in a book review, sampling a bit of a song for a musical parody, and making a recording for their own, noncommercial use.
This week heavy metal group Metallica forced Napster to ban 317,377 users from the service on the ground they had illegally copied Metallica songs.
But suppose someone owned the entire Metallica CD and just wanted to use Napster to make MP3 copies of a few tunes?
That ought to be considered ``fair use,'' and the MP3.com approach would have allowed this copying.
Even if the recording industry wins all its battles in court, new programs are being developed to allow the sharing of MP3 files.
Gnutella and other programs eliminate the key legal vulnerability of Napster its dependence on central computers to facilitate file-sharing.
The recording industry is pinning its hopes for protecting its wares on encryption.
The Sony Corp., which pioneered the Walkman technology that revolutionized music listening, has devised the Music Clip, a new kind of portable music player that forces users to convert MP3 files into a coded format.
When Sony invented the Walkman, which played unencrypted tape cassettes, it had not yet bought the CBS recording company.
Encryption denies the buyer an opportunity to move the music into different formats, to combine selected cuts off CDs or to use bits for parody or other legal purposes.
It would seem to violate the ``fair use'' doctrine.
Congress and the courts need to refine copyright protection in a way that benefits consumers as well as giant industries.
Meanwhile, major record companies ought to go beyond legal stratagems to define a marketing program that fully utilizes the MP3 format.
The songs of Metallica and other famous artists ought to be available for a small fee, and the work of those popular acts ought to be featured on the same site as those of emerging artists, as MP3.com had planned.
The great promise of Internet technology is that it will make ``science and the useful arts'' widely available at the touch of a computer mouse.
The recording industry should not let Draconian interpretations of the copyright laws inhibit the growth of this powerful medium.
