Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer resources.
Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth problems.
But Napster officials said there have been only a few scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine'' of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices, including one in San Francisco.
The message: Napster is officially off-limits at work.
Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one office was going to just one location Napster Inc. in San Mateo, Calif. ``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the operation.
Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.
``It's like potato chips, you can't download just one,'' Buss said.
The Napster software, created by founder Shawn Fanning, allows music fans to share their MP3-formatted songs directly with other Napster members without cost.
But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica and rap star Dr. Dre have sued Napster claiming the program promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
About 100 universities have enacted highly publicized bans or restrictions on Napster because student file-swapping was clogging the institutions' high-speed Internet connections.
Three colleges, Yale University, Indiana University and the University of Southern California, blocked Napster to avoid getting drawn into Metallica's copyright infringement lawsuit against Napster.
MP3s have flourished at universities because they afford students free access to high-speed Internet connections.
But businesses also have those same high-speed connections.
``It would make sense that people are using Napster at work,'' said David Gould, who operates an independent Web site called NapsterMP3.com, which offers Napster fans forums and news, but not MP3s.
Gould of Charlotte, N.C., said he has heard of no other company bans of Napster.
However, he said that about 20 percent of the visitors logged on to his site yesterday morning were from business-related Internet addresses, and that percentage seems to go up on Mondays when workers return after the weekend off.
Gould said visitors to his 3-week-old site yesterday included users from financial services companies, the military, media outlets and the U.S. Senate.
Napster spokesman Dan Wool had no specific information of other companies that cracked down on Napster use.
However, he said the bans had more to do with workers slacking off than computer resource problems.
