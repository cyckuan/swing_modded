Act of 1998.
Patel, however, flatly rejected those arguments, saying e-mail messages by Napster's own founders admit the program was designed to share ``pirated'' versions of copyright-protected songs.
She also shot down Napster's contention that the program, even if used for illegal purposes, could be spared because there were some legal ``fair use'' applications such as a promotional vehicle for unknown new artists.
That argument appeared ``late, after the beginning of this litigation,'' Patel said.
Patel's injunction, intended to prevent any more damage to the recording industry until after the suit goes to trial, orders Napster to prevent members from swapping songs controlled by the record companies that filed the suit.
Boies argued that the injunction is unfair to Napster because technicians have not devised a way to separate which songs are legal.
Patel said the injunction will force them to come up with a method.
``They created the monster; I guess that's the consequences they face,'' Patel said.
Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock band Metallica, was especially pleased by the ruling.
Metallica drew the ire of its fans by filing its own suit against Napster for allowing the band's songs to be freely swapped.
With Napster, ``the right of what happens to my music was taken away from me,'' Ulrich said in a telephone interview from New York.
Now, he said, the challenge ``is to make people in this country understand that because technology make it available and because the Internet gives you access to it, that doesn't mean you have a right to it'' Legal experts said the ruling gives the recording industry a clear copyright enforcement victory.
But other file sharing programs like Gnutella that are not controlled by any one company are going to be harder to control.
``The liability issue against Napster was very clear,'' said Brian Mudge, partner at Kenyon Kenyon in Wash. DC, specializing in intellectual property cases.
``That's going to be a whole different ballgame to enforce and police.
The record industry will have to embrace this technology before it loses total control over it.''
With the possibility of a court-ordered Napster shutdown looming, Napster fans had already started moving to other file-sharing programs such as Gnutella, iMesh and Scour, which is also the subject of another copyright infringement suit by the motion picture industry.
