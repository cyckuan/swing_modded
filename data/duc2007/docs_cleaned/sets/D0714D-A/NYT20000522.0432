Act to hold Napster and similar technology companies more accountable for copyright infringement.
``We think Napster is an innovative technology, but we should use that technology in legal ways,'' said Robert Atkinson, co-author of the report ``Napster and Online Piracy.''
The report recommends that Congress change the DMCA to require Internet-based services like Napster to obtain ``identifiable and verifiable'' information about their users to help track down copyright violators.
Napster members can sign on anonymously.
The report also said the DMCA needs to have more specific timetables for taking down copyright violators because it now gives Napster and similar services ``no incentive to act in a timely fashion.''
The report suggests that judges be allowed more flexibility to grant injunctions.
``It may be impossible to write a law that accounts for all future technological innovation, but a judge will know a pirate's den when he or she sees it,'' the report said.
The institute will present the paper at a House Small-Business Committee hearing scheduled for tomorrow to examine Internet music technologies, but Atkinson admitted he does not expect Congress to act anytime in the next several months.
