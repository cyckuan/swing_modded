Metallica, which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San Mateo, Calif., startup, wants Napster to block further access to all of the users on the 60,000-page list, a request Napster says it might honor.
``We're trying to put Napster out of business, or at least out of the copyright infringement business,'' Metallica attorney Howard E. King said Tuesday.
Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in damages.
The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica songs on the Internet without charge.
Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by rap artists Dr. Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America trade group.
The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by their students.
But each institution was dropped from the suit after blocking Napster permanently.
Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the suit.
However, King said Napster officials said they would block any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify them.
So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30.
The firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members and enough information to identify the users' computers.
It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded during that period, but King said the band contends any song offered by Napster users is illegal.
In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the 60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes.
Metallica sent invitations to media organizations saying that ``all coverage is welcome and questions will be taken.''
``Part of what this litigation is about is a public education process, too,'' King said.
But King said the band does not intend to sue each of the Napster users on the hit list.
``It's not the band's intention to kick the rear ends of people who have a few files here and there,'' King said.
``The goal here is not to intimidate the fans.
The goal is to stop Napster.''
Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company would accept Ulrich's list and review it to determine if any users needed to be booted off the service.
