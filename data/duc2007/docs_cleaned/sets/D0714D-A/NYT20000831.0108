They popped in to make sure he wasn't peddling stolen goods.
When they left, Daddy didn't go with them, so I assume he was clean, or at least very clever.
If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations would have come to his defense.
But some purveyors of stolen goods have friends in high places.
Just look at who's going to bat for Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
Essentially, Patel agreed with music industry executives and me that Napster's primary business is the facilitation of thievery.
She ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup.
Meanwhile, an extraordinary group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the company.
The Association of American Physicians Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment.
Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet.
They warn that corporations may use the Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide authorized links on Ritalin?''
``The outcome would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively silenced.''
But the record companies aren't complaining about people who post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album.
They're upset about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to facilitate such theft.
Consider the following quote from a Napster official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but pushing demand.''
Among them, these three groups represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet services.
Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped write this amicus brief.
It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing defense of Napster ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists.
Still, their argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a point with a good deal of merit.
``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette recorders?
In 1981, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony Corp. for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders.
The Betamax machines were a license to steal, the movie moguls alleged.
People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV programs that would cost the studios billions.
There was only one solution ban Betamax.
Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed.
Fortunately, the US Supreme Court stepped in.
In 1984, the court ruled that even if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property, the devices also had many legitimate uses.
It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its abuse.
It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw Patel didn't try to ban Napster.
Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music.
The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom tells you all you need to know.
It's a tacit admission of the obvious the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods.
Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue.
But that doesn't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for forgetting something I learned at my father's knee dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned.
