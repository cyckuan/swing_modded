Los Angeles attorney Howard E. King sent letters to the universities this week after reading a San Francisco Chronicle story that said most colleges were not restricting student use of Napster, which he said allows ``piracy on a massive scale.''
``There's been a lot of public discussion about the morality and the legality of Napster.
King gave the universities about two weeks to respond but said he is not threatening legal action.
``Even without the threat of litigation from artists and other copyright owners, I believe that you can easily recognize the irony of encouraging your students to matriculate in the creative arts while engaging in behavior which, if unchecked, will make it impossible for those students to earn an income from their future creative efforts,'' King wrote in a letter to Harvard University President Neil L. Rudenstine.
Still, the pending copyright infringement lawsuits Metallica and Dr. Dre filed against the San Mateo, Calif., startup in April named three colleges as defendants and left room for others to be added.
The three colleges named, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, were dropped as defendants after they banned Napster.
Representatives of several colleges notified this week by King, including the University of Virginia, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, said they will discuss the request before deciding whether to take action.
Berkeley ``does take seriously any notification we get of copyright infringement,'' said Mike Smith, assistant chancellor for legal affairs.
Both Smith and Stanford legal counsel Debra Zumwalt said their universities have received complaints of copyright violations in the past, usually involving incidents like music, text or photos posted without permission on student Web sites.
``Our policy to date has been if there is evidence of copyright infringement brought to us, we act on that,'' Zumwalt said.
However, she said, the school so far has not banned ``access to any particular site of any kind.''
Whether Napster fans are violating copyright law is also a central part of Napster's defense in a federal copyright infringement suit filed by the country's biggest record labels.
The U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear the case Oct. 2.
``These letters are a heavy-handed attempt by Metallica's lawyers to increase university bans as part of their effort to shut down Napster,'' company Chief Executive Officer Hank Barry said in a news release.
``Students who engage in person-to-person file sharing are not copyright infringers, and we hope that, while the litigation is pending, schools would not be intimidated by Metallica and limit the freedom of students to participate in the Napster community.''
Students who use Napster or similar programs like Scour said they shouldn't, and likely wouldn't, be denied.
``If Napster were illegal, the school would have the right to ban access to it,'' said UC Berkeley student Jim Wu.
``But until it is illegal, I don't think the school has a right to ban access.''
It might be a little harder, but people will still find ways to do it,'' he said.
``They probably don't have a right to restrict access, but of course they can do whatever they want,'' Papasin said.
``We're college students; we should have access to everything.''
Meanwhile, lawyers for the record companies filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco supporting a lower court's preliminary injunction that could shut Napster completely.
And the Motion Picture Association of America and 19 other organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the injunction against Napster.
``With one voice, we band together to send a simple and clear message: It is wrong to build a business that relies on the theft of copyrighted materials, and we oppose Napster's business model for doing just that,'' MPAA President Jack Valenti said in a news release.
