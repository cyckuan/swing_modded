The target is Napster, the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or superstars.
Either way, the artists don't get royalties and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
In one corner stands Metallica and Dr. Dre the heavy metal and rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against Napster for copyright infringement.
Other artists from Don Henley to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails are defending their position, with Henley saying that Napster is engaged in outright ``stealing'' from songwriters.
In the other corner is Limp Bizkit, the rap-rock act that has become Napster's lobbying arm and is taking $1.7 million in Napster sponsorship to tour this summer.
The Offspring and Chuck D of Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone who thinks otherwise is old school.
All of which comes just a week after the Recording Industry Association of America (on behalf of major labels such as Sony and Arista) won a lawsuit against MP3.com a music database service.
MP3.com was found guilty of copyright infringement for its my.mp3.com branch, which allows users to create a digital locker from MP3's database of 80,000 CDs.
The RIAA is now asking for damages that could run in the billions of dollars.
The subplots to the digital battle are many, and are being played out in light of increased sales of compact discs.
For one, Metallica has been pitted against some of its fans, one of whom went on Napster's Web site this week to write that Metallica was a bunch of ``sellouts.''
He added: ``The (Metallica) song `Master of Puppets' is fitting, only this time, Metallica is on the wrong end of the strings.''
Metallica's response was to hire a British firm, NetPD, to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week, which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4 million Metallica songs an average of nearly five songs per person during that time, said Gayle Fine of the band's management company, Q Prime.
Metallica has asked that Napster drop those names from its files.
As of Thursday, Napster had not removed the names.
One fan posted an angry parody site, www.paylars.com, which asks fans to send money to the band to pay for songs they downloaded on Napster.
Another subplot features Limp Bizkit's singer-rapper, Fred Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records, whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate lawsuit against Napster.
Interscope has not commented on what it thinks of Durst's actions.
But the larger issue has nothing to do with opposing rock personalities.
It has to do with whether 200 years of copyright law will be thrown out the window by the digital revolution.
``The recording industry is not anti-Napster,'' says Jayson Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA.
``Nobody is trying to keep an unsigned band from getting its music heard.
But the RIAA is concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not want to give away their music for free.''
``It's not just the artist.
You're messing with the record companies now and they don't want to lose that money,'' adds J.C. Chasez of the band 'N Sync.
The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA fight its battles, though more and more artists are speaking out.
The lesser-known ones tend to defend Napster, for as Bill Janovitz of Buffalo Tom says, ``For artists that nobody has heard of, Napster may help them.''
But the bigger the act, the more likely it is to bash Napster.
``It's not your right to give it away or exchange it with your friends, just as it's not right to copy software or photocopy books to give away.
It represents the artist's work.
Just because a technology exists where you can duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.
There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of stuff, that's fine.
But it's not everybody's right.
Once I record something, it's not public domain to give it away freely.
So I stand behind Dr. Dre and Metallica and support them.
And that's not trying to be the outdated musician who is trying to stop technology.
Technology is here to stay and I'm the first one downloading the newest update to software that I don't need and that makes my machine not work.''
As for Bizkit's Durst, Reznor blasted him by saying, ``Durst is the brain trust of all that is wrong with music.
He supports (Napster) because they gave him $2 million to tour.
He forgot to mention that in his press release.''
(Bizkit was unavailable for comment since he's in the studio, said publicist Jenny Bodi.)
Singer Don Henley is equally outspoken.
``The bottom line is this: The works of recording artists are being stolen and disseminated over the Internet without fair and just compensation for those artists,'' he said.
``This is the way songwriters and singers make their living, and stealing that music and giving it away for free is not right.
``Then there's the absurd argument that `Well, rock stars are wealthy, and therefore, it's all right to steal from them,' '' said Henley.
``But the majority of singers and songwriters and recording artists in this business are not wealthy.
They're struggling hand to mouth, day to day, and they need fair and just compensation for their work.
I'm deeply concerned, as are all artists about these issues, particularly Napster.''
Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning, a 19-year-old then-Northeastern University student who dropped out after his freshman year to move to San Mateo, Calif., where the company is based.
Napster is growing dramatically spokeswoman Deborah Orr won't put a figure on the number of users, but cites ``millions, with a 5 to 25 percent increase every day.''
The firm refers to itself as the ``embattled MP3 file-swapping software company.''
Clearly, there's a martyrdom complex here, though Fanning and other Napster executives weren't available to discuss it for this article.
Orr said, ``they can't comment on anything touching on the lawsuits.''
Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow in climbing aboard the digital revolution, hence the fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3.com.
Earlier this week Sony and Universal Music announced plans to launch a joint music download subscription service.
Meanwhile, a new company, myplay.com, has been working with labels on a ``totally legal basis,'' says founder David Pakman, who worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer.
His company enables users to have a digital locker of songs, but royalties are paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks but can't copy them.
Myplay will launch a partnership with aol.com in two weeks, so the timing is perfect for this new startup, now that Napster and my.mp3.com have been scarred by lawsuits.
While most artists have chosen sides in the Napster dispute, some artists are still sitting on the fence.
So something that opens things up and makes people more musically educated can be a good thing.''
``It's a waste of time to go after (Napster) because you're not going to be able to stop free trade on the Internet.
Everybody should stop wringing their hands about it.
``It's going to take two or three years to sort itself out,'' said Corgan.
``It's going to be the future, but we'll eventually have to figure out a system that gives the artist some copyright payment.
