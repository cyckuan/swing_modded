Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week that they, too, will not block access to Napster.
Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E. King, would make a college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property.''
But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are more important than the threat of copyright infringement.
Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of recordings.
Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment industry.
The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
Opponents of Napster had hoped to recruit more high-profile schools to lead a nationwide boycott against the site.
But Debra Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel, said the university resisted because Napster in some instances can be used legally and for academic purposes, such as in a class focused on copyright issues.
``It's a slippery slope once you start banning access to Web sites because people can potentially violate copyright laws, where do you stop?''
Zumwalt said.
