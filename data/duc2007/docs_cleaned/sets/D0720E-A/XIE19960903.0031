Egypt today gave Israel three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians, otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
The ultimatum was issued by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny at a press conference today.
Bassiouny said that Egypt demanded Israel to take immediate actions in implementing the signed agreements with the Palestinians.
The actions included redeploying Israeli troops from Hebron, conducting further redeployments under the Oslo accords, opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and lifting the closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.
He stressed that Egypt wants deeds but not words from the Israeli government.
Bassiouny issued the stern warning only one day after Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy paid his first visit to Egypt, during which he held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and President Hosni Mubarak.
Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, saying, "I cannot imagine that the economic summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not happened yet."
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early March.
The new Israeli government promised to conduct the pullout, but demanded certain revisions.
"In the absence of implementation, it will be a very serious situation.
It is impossible to imagine that we can talk about regional cooperation when the peace process is obstructed or paralyzed.
It would be illogical, out of the question," Moussa added.
Levy said today Moussa's view was exactly that of Mubarak, who was responsible for issuing the ultimatum.
In a strong reaction to Egypt's threat, the Israeli government today warned Cairo against "making things worse" by issuing such an ultimatum.
The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement blasting Egypt for issuing "an unfortunate threat that can only raise the tension in the region."
An Israeli official pointed out that Egypt needs the Cairo summit more than Israel does.
Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo accords.
Although Egypt is the first Arab country that established diplomatic ties with Israel, the two states have been slow in normalizing their relations, which are often marred by the disputes over the peace process and bilateral frictions.
