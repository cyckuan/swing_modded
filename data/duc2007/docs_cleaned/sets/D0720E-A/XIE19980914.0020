When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace.
Five years later, the rosy picture remains a dream.
Under the Oslo, most of the West Bank should have been handed over to the Palestinians two years ago.
Today, however, the Palestinians are still struggling to get a small portion of the land.
On the part of Israel, it is still dissatisfied with what the Palestinians have done on fighting terrorism, declaring that more Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years since Oslo than in the 15 preceding years.
The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace demonstrations in Israel.
Israel and the Palestinians had been expected to sign an agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in Washington Sunday, but nothing happened.
Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is still shuttling between the two sides to bridge their gaps over the second stage of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the prospect of an agreement remains unclear.
The Oslo peace process went quite smoothly in its first two years.
Following a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas against Israel in early 1996 and the current Likud government came to power in the middle of that year, the peace process began to falter.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in 1996.
In line with this policy, Israel began to build Jewish settlements, abolishing the former Labor government's policy of freezing their establishment, and delayed the redeployment in the West Bank.
Israel also tightened the control over Jerusalem, on which both Israel and the Palestinians claim sovereignty, by intensifying settlement activity and demolishing Palestinian houses.
In June this year, it approved a controversial plan to expand the city far beyond its current borders, annexing some areas in the West Bank.
All these measures, together with sporadic Hamas terror attacks, have derailed the Oslo process and led to the current stalemate in the peace talks.
Oslo Accords have designed a confidence-building mechanism by leaving most of the toughest issues to final status talks, but the depth of recrimination between the two sides has shaken the foundation of the peace treaty.
Political observers said that the Oslo Accords are in a coma, if not dead, and the lack of mutual confidence is the root.
Five years of peace process, no matter how tortuous it goes, have changed the attitudes of Israeli and Palestinian people.
Analysts said that more and more Israelis are accepting the reality of a future Palestinian state and most Palestinians believe there is no alternative to Oslo Accords.
Since the deadline of Oslo Accords is approaching, analysts noted that the two sides have to rebuild their mutual trust as soon as possible and carry out all signed agreements seriously and swiftly.
That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago, they said.
