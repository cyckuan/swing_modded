At least three Palestinian students were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers Tuesday at Bitonia checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian security police said.
The clashes erupted when the Palestinian students threw stones at the Israeli soliders, who responded with fired rubber-coated bullets, the police said.
The students held a demonstration on the occation of May 4, the date on which the five-year Palestinian interim self-rule period, stipulated in the Oslo accords, expires, to demand an early end of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land and the declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the territories.
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
And the Palestinians believe they have the right to declare an independent state on the day.
However, a permanent peace accord remains out of reach by Tuesday and Palestinian leadership has delayed decision over statehood declaration until after the May 17 Israeli elections to avoid squandering international good-will.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited dozens of states to rally support for his statehood proclamation, but many states urged him to hold off the unilateral move on May 4 to avert being exploited by hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming elections.
"We are ordered to maintain order in the territories since Monday night and we are prepared for any eventualities," the officer said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Fatah movement also organized a large-scale demonstration in the West Bank town of Hebron Tuesday morning, urging the palestinian leadership to declare an independent state.
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched from the Hebron University to the "border line" between H1 and H2, but no clashes are reported so far.
About 500 Jewish settlers, whose settlements are located in H1 area, live among 130,000 Palestinians, whose living areas are called H2.
Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is scheduled to hold a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in Ramallah to demand the Palestinian leadership let the Palestinian people exercise their sovereignty on the Palestinian land and get rid of the Oslo accords.
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another Palestinian political faction, is to organize a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in Gaza to voice its support for the declaration of the statehood.
