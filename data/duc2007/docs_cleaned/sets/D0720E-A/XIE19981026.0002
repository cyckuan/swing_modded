Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said were not good agreements.
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal did provide security guarantee for Israel while being required to relinquish lands to the Palestinians.
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of "land-for-peace."
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to fulfill their security commitment before Israel hands over part of the West Bank to them.
He said this was the best he could have been achieved under the current circumstance.
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye Plantation near Washington.
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
