Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa reaffirmed Sunday that Egypt opposes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin's proposal for holding a Madrid II international conference on the Mideast peace process.
"There is nothing called `Madrid II'," Moussa was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as saying.
He was commenting on the idea put forward by Netanyahu for convening a multilateral conference to tackle all regional issues but not the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock specifically.
In an interview published Saturday on the Spanish newspaper ABC, Netanyahu said he believed that peace talks held along the lines of the 1991 Madrid peace conference would be "useful" to solve the regional problems, such as water distribution and environment protection.
But he did not want the conference to tackle specifically the Israeli-Palestinian peace stalemate, arguing that negotiations on bilateral levels are being held with the U.S. participation.
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians.
The Madrid conference, which brought Israelis and Arabs to face-to-face talks for the first time, formulated the the landmark land-for-peace principle and the framework for bilateral and multilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Moussa reiterated that there is no need at present to hold a Madrid II conference since the 1991 Madrid conference has already laid the main bases for the peace process on all tracks.
The top Egyptian diplomat noted that there is now an Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference to deal with the crisis created by the present Israeli policy.
He explained that the proposed conference is "not to renegotiate the principles of Madrid conference," rather to call on the parties to implement these principles.
During his visit to France in May, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac jointly proposed the holding of an international conference to discuss the current peace deadlock.
Meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Cairo Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flatly rejected Netanyahu's Madrid II idea, warning that this could blast the whole peace process.
