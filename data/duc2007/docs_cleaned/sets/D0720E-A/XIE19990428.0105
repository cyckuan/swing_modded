Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
Talking to reporters before meeting with foreign diplomats here on Wednesday afternoon, Netanyahu said the peace process could be moved forward if Arafat refrains from doing so.
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year, when the five-year transitional period under Oslo expires.
The Palestine Liberation Organization Central Council is discussing in Gaza whether to declare statehood on May 4.
Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli control.
The peace process could only be moved forward through negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could help.
Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.
The commission's resolution also calls for the right of Palestinian refugees to return home.
