Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin expressed optimism here Tuesday that the three-way Camp David summit could achieve positive results and agreement could be reached.
Barak, Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton gathered at Camp David near Washington Tuesday for the crucial summit, which will try to reach a framework agreement on the key issues of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and water.
"Without an agreement it will be bad, ....but I think the high expectations and hopes create a situation whereby it is almost impossible to return home without an agreement," he said.
Beilin was one of the architects who helped forge the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization that provided outlines and principles for the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Each side has much to pay if there is a failure at the summit, he said, adding that the agreement could not be reached without compromises from both sides.
