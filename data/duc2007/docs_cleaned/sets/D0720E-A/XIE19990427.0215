Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council started its discussions here Tuesday on the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over the meeting, which was held at the Presidential Office and attended by over 100 council members.
The council has 124 members.
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin attended the meeting as observers.
Representatives from other Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are demonstrating in front of the office, urging the council and Arafat not to postpone the declaration of statehood on May 4.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date.
For this purpose, he traveled recently to many countries to seek their support and advise over this matter.
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank territories now under its control.
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement within in a year.
President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to help reach an agreement.
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are anxiously to see what decision the council would make on the statehood issue.
