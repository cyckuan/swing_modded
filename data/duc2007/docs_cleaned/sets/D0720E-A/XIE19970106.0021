After an overnight secret meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about reaching a Hebron deal.
Speaking to businessmen in Tel Aviv today, Netanyahu said that some progress had been achieved at his meeting with Arafat which was held at the Eretz checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip.
"We have made progress, but we still have not reached agreement on all the issues.
We will make sure that we will stand firm on the principles of security and reciprocity," he said.
Netanyahu said he was optimistic about reaching peace and security, adding that such negotiation required "patience."
Today's surprise meeting lasted for over three hours and ended at seven O'clock this morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told Israel Radio.
Arafat convened a meeting this afternoon of his senior advisers and some members of the Palestinian negotiating team to update his meeting with Netanyahu.
Noticeably, Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny also took part in the meeting to learn about the latest developments in the Hebron talks.
Egypt has been under fire recently from Israel, which alleged that Cairo was using its influence to encourage the Palestinian side to delay the Hebron deal so to extort more concessions.
Israeli and Palestinian sources all agreed that, with today's summit, the difficult Hebron talks that have been lingering on for three months seemed to have taken a positive turn.
The summit was the result of Ross' intensive mediation efforts as the U.S. is increasing pressure on both sides to wrap up the Hebron deal.
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September 1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March.
Israel has delayed the Hebron pullback since the wave of Islamic suicide bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.
The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further pullback.
It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the Hebron agreement.
Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to bridge the remaining gap.
He held a meeting with Arafat this morning, and is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu late today.
