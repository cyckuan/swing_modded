The Damascus-based Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) today denounced Israel's policy of settlement, describing it as a serious challenge to the foundations and principles of the Mideast peace process.
This came in a statement issued by the Arab Parliamentary Union in the Syrian capital today.
Israel has announced that it plans to make new settlements in Jerusalem and Bethlehem and to construct 300 more residential units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
The plans are continuation of Israeli Prime Minister's Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of Judaizing the Holy City of Jerusalem and altering its Arab-Islamic identity, said the statement.
Israel is trying to encircle the Arab cities with a belt of the Jewish settlements, the statement added.
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community.
The APU called on parliamentarians of all over the world to urge their governments to exert all types of pressure on Israel to abandon this peace-destroying policy.
The APU pointed out that it is an international responsibility to save the Mideast peace process by compelling Israel to abandon its policy of settlement and to declare its commitment to the principles of the peace process, particularly the land-for-peace principle.
