In a stern warning to Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the intifada if the peace process collapses.
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
The Palestinian leader said "the Palestinian people do not remember the painful experience to cry, but to renew our commitment to our national goal - the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital."
He said that those who oppose the Palestinian move to achieve independence "can drink from the Gaza Sea or Dead Sea."
Afrafat stressed that he was ready to die in order to put East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, in the Palestinian hands.
The PNA is hoping to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, a move opposed by Israel which has declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal capital.
Summarizing the suffering of the Palestinians in the past, Arafat paid tributes to the bravery of his people who have carried on the longest revolution of this century.
He added that the Palestinians will continue to stay on their land and nothing, even nuclear, biological and other weapons, will force them to leave.
Arafat's warning came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed in January, 1997, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year.
But Israel has delayed the move due to the dispute over the scope of redeployment.
In order to break the stalemate, the United States is currently hosting Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Washington to bridge the gap.
But no breakthrough has been achieved so far, as the Palestinian side has turned down a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment, which is to be implemented in two phases according to the PNA's fulfillment of its obligations.
Over 3 million Palestinians have been forced to exile since Israel won the 1948 independence war and occupied a large part of the Palestinian territories.
Among the activities is a proposed international conference of all countries which have suffered similar disaster to discuss the Palestinian catastrophe.
