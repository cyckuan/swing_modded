Israeli former Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressed Friday welcome to the peace agreement reached by Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Wye Plantation outside Washington.
Reports reaching here from the plantation said that after nine days of intensive talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached an agreement on issues discussed.
The signing ceremony was planned at White House later Friday.
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, release part of the 3,400 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, open two roads between the West Bank and Gaza Strip as safe passage while the Palestinian side convenes its National Council to abrogate parts of the anti-Israeli articles from its Chart and other concrete plans to strengthen security cooperation with Israel.
The agreement reached at the Wye Plantation was a victory for the Oslo accords which kicked off the Mideast peace process, Peres told the Israeli TV Channel 1.
Agreement means everything has been decided on paper and its implementation is more important, Peres said, urging both sides to implement the agreement according to agreed timetable.
In Israel, only a minority of people oppose the peace and the majority must support what has been reached at Wye Plantation, Peres said.
Peres, who is also a Knesset (Parliament) member, contributed a great deal in the peace process, particularly in formulating the Oslo accords.
But Israel's right-wing groups and politicians strongly opposed what has been reached at the Wye Plantation.
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told the Channel 1 that he will oppose Netanyahu's decision to hand further West Bank land to the Palestinians.
