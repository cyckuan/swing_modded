senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
Sha'ath made the remark while commenting on an Israeli document concerning PNA's obligations and decisions relating to Israel's security in the West Bank.
On Tuesday, the Israeli cabinet passed a 12-page document accusing the PNA of violating its obligations.
And on Wednesday, the cabinet decided to keep all the areas in the West Bank it termed as vital to Israel's security and national interests in a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
These areas include two security strips on each side of the West Bank, water resources, Jewish settlements, strategic roads and Jewish historical sites.
Sha'ath said the Hebron agreement signed early last year stipulate that Israel carry out a three-stage troop redeployment in the West Bank by mid-1998, adding the Israeli cabinet's decisions on security issues in the West bank meant that it does not want to redeploy its troops in the West Bank but rather permanently occupy the Palestinian lands.
Referring to the final-status talks as initiated by Israel, he said how the PNA could enter into such talks with the Israeli government which refused to redeploy its troops in the West Bank and commit to its obligations as specified by the signed accords.
The permanent solution of the Middle East problem is the establishment of an independent state of Palestine, safe borders between Israel and Palestine, safe cooperation in all fields between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Jerusalem should be the safe capital of the two peoples, Sha'ath said.
He urged the U.S. and other countries to put pressure on Israel to implement all agreements it signed with the PNA.
