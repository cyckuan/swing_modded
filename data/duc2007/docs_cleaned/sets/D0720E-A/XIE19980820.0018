Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to attend a meeting in Norway next week to mark the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords.
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Norwegian foreign minister on Tuesday personally requested that Netanyahu attend the meeting, but Netanyahu said he was too busy to go to Norway.
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, also said the prime minister had to deal with "more important things" in Israel at the present time.
Besides, Netanyahu said he did not intend to travel to the birth place of the Oslo Accords since he had no part in the historic peace agreements.
But he reportedly would send his diplomatic advisor Uzi Arad to take part in the commemoration.
The question was in fact cropping up earlier this month when the Norwegian government invited Netanyahu to attend the celebrations.
An aide to the prime minister said then that Netanyahu "thought it would not look good if he attended, when the Oslo work is not completed here."
Both Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres are planning to attend and scheduled to speak at the meeting to be held in Oslo next Monday.
Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross would also participate, Israel Radio said.
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Since their signing in September in 1993, Netanyahu has regularly attacked the Oslo Accords but has grudgingly reiterated commitment to carry them forward.
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords.
