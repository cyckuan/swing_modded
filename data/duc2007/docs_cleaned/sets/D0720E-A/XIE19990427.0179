Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat said here Tuesday that he favored to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year.
Addressing the meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council, Arafat said the outcome and fate of the Palestinian people's struggle have asked the Palestinian leadership to declare an independent Palestinian state in the territories on time.
In his speech, Arafat briefed the council members about the current development in the Middle East peace process, the situation in the region and his discussions about the statehood issue with leaders of foreign countries he recently visited.
Anyway, he said, the issue of the statehood declaration should be decided by the council.
Shortly after Arafat's address to the meeting, a report on whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year was submitted to the council for consideration, a senior Palestinian official said.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton's letter to Arafat was also made public to the council, the official added.
The PLO Central Council started discussing here Tuesday over the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin attended the meeting as observers.
Representatives from other Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are demonstrating in front of the Office, urging the council and Arafat not to postpone the declaration on May 4.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date.
For this purpose, he traveled recently to many countries in the world to seek their support and advise over this matter.
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank territories now under its control.
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement within in a year.
President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to help reach an agreement.
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are anxiously to see what decision the council would make on this statehood issue.
