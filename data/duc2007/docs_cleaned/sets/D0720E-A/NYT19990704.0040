He carries a heavy load of memories of a homeland that was taken by force, leaving many of its people in refugee camps or under Israeli occupation.
Wherever he goes, Said finds fellow Palestinians being abused by Israeli settlers and authorities.
Their history, as he tells it, began with ``the catastrophe'' of 1948, when hundreds of Arabs were killed and thousands of others lost their homes and property to the conquering Jews.
In this hourlong BBC production, the prolific writer and scholar sets aside his intellectual credentials and makes little attempt at evenhanded reporting as he concentrates on his family's loss and on what he sees as the continuing afflictions of the Palestinians.
Everywhere, the camera finds symbols of Israeli power: the guns and bulldozers used to repress peaceable Arabs.
Missing from his account is any acknowledgment that there may be an Israeli side to the area's tumultuous history.
Despite expressions of sympathy from friendly Israelis, Said finds mainly oppression by Jews and indifference by most of the world to what he condemns as prevailing injustice: the years of expulsion, uprooting and destruction, with no alleviation in sight.
Arabs, he says, have been demonized, while the ``barbaric, inhuman'' actions of the Israelis go uncriticized.
As he sees the situation, the new Palestinian authority is cooperating in holding down the indigenous population; the land of his childhood is gone forever.
The viewer need not accept Said's sad and bitter polemic as the whole story, affected as it is by his passion over the world his people have lost.
