Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
Arafat made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his visit to China.
He will start his three-day visit to China on Monday.
"We have the longest revolution and the longest intifada in the modern history.
The collapse of the (signed peace) accords ... will return the region to the circle of violence," he said.
"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said, "only requires the honest implementation of the accords and adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242 and 338."
Arafat blamed Israel for the 16-month-old stalemate in the peace process, saying the Israeli side had in reality relinquished the peace accords ever since the Israeli incumbent government came to power two years ago.
Israel has failed to keep their promises made in signed agreements on issues like redeployment in the West Bank, Jewish settlements, and issues of transition period, Arafat said.
"These measures constitute grave and flagrant violation of international legitimate resolutions, including Resolution 242 ...
They also violate the Oslo accords which very distinctly call for refraining from any measures that touch any issues of the final negotiating phase with the issue of Jerusalem in the forefront," he noted.
He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
"We are regularly losing more than 10 million (U.S.) dollars each day by the economic blockade, that is to say, many times as much as the donor countries are offering if measured on annual basis," he said, adding that unemployment rate in the Palestinian areas exceeds 65 percent.
The Israeli policy is causing much frustration to the Palestinians and leading to misery and grave danger, Arafat said, noting that "the situation is approaching starvation, and I ring the bells of danger.
In as much as peace is in the interest of all, the explosion will hit everyone."
