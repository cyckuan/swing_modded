Israeli and Palestinian negotiators opened another round of final-status talks in Israel's southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Sunday, in an effort to reach a framework agreement on final-status issues.
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Abbo headed their respective negotiating teams to the talks, the third intensive one with the involvement of the United States.
The U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is scheduled to join next Tuesday the current talks, which will last till May 12.
The two sides have already held two rounds of intensive talks since March 21 with the involvement of the United States at Bolling Air Base near Washington, the United States, but no substantial progress was made.
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed last September in Egypt, the two sides have to reach a framework agreement on final- status by February 15 and a final-status peace accord by September 13, 2000.
But due to slow progress in the talks, Israel has suggested the two sides reach the framework agreement in May this year.
The final-status issues that the two sides have to tackle include the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and water.
Moreover, the two sides also have to decide on the last Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Oslo accords signed in 1993.
So far, Israel has already handed over about 43 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
Israel has to transfer the remaining West Bank territories except some military zones and Jewish settlements to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.
