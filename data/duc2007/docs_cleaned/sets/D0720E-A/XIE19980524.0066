The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat emphasized Sunday in Gaza that Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, according to the Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements.
He was commenting on Israel's activities marking the 31st unification of Jerusalem which are going on on Sunday here.
Israel captured the whole Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
Arafat also urged the United States to announce its peace initiative concerning Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank in order to put more pressure on the Israeli government to live up to its contractual obligations.
He said that during his meeting in Cairo with Egyptian Presdient Hosni Mubarak, they discussed the Egyptian-French initiative for convening an international conference for countries aiming at breaking the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
The Cairo meeting was positive and constructive, he said.
Meanwhile, a large number of extremist Jewish demonstrators are gathering near the Kattanin Gate that leads to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, as part of their 31st celebrations of Jerusalem unification.
The Jewish demonstrators burned a model of Oslo Accords and tried to enter into the Mosque.
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials and civilians, including the PNA's Jerusalem governor, are gathering inside the premises of the Mosque to try to prevent the Jewish demonstrators from entering into the holy site.
The Israeli Peace Bloc also demonstrated in East Jerusalem on Sunday to voice their support for the the peace process.
There is so far no report of conflict between Israelis demonstrators and Palestinians.
