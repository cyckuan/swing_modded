But there's a catch: You can only listen to the first chapter via a Liquid Audio player, which can be downloaded free.
Then you can read the second chapter and order copies of the book online.
Liquid Audio Inc. is a major provider of software and services for the digital delivery of music over the Internet.
This is the first time Doubleday, part of the Random House publishing empire, has released a preview using a digital download in conjunction with a print excerpt.
This is just another marketing tool, says Terrence Chenge, Web producer for Random House.
``The extensive distribution network of Liquid Audio gives us an additional channel for promoting and selling our books, both online and through traditional markets.''
``The Brethren'' is about three former judges who are perfecting a mail-order scam while serving time in a Florida federal prison.
They all are getting rich until something goes terribly wrong on the outside.
Some of the Web sites offering the preview are www.amazon .com/grisham, www .barnesandnoble.com/bookshelf /thrillers/grisham1.asp or go.borders.com/features /brethren.xcv.
Winfrey winner: North Carolina novelist Robert Morgan is the latest author to join Oprah Winfrey's exclusive circle.
The TV talk show host has chosen Morgan's novel ``Gap Creek'' (Algonquin Books, $22.95) for her next book club discussion.
Set in turn-of-the-century Appalachia, ``Gap Creek'' is the story of 17-year-old Judy Harmon, who has to deal with premature births and deaths, malnutrition, poverty and other hardships.
Morgan, a 55-year-old poet who turned to fiction in 1984, is also the author of ``The Truest Pleasure'' and ``The Hinterlands.''
Irish eyes: It's been years since Edna O'Brien left Ireland for London, but her homeland still has an irresistible attraction.
After writing a biography of James Joyce last year, O'Brien returns to fiction and the Irish landscape in April with ``Wild Decembers'' (Houghton Mifflin, $24).
The novel traces the story of a sister, her brother and a love-hate relationship with a neighboring landowner.
O'Brien will give a preview of the work during a free reading at 7 tonight at Emory University, followed by a reception and book signing.
