Oprah Winfrey was such a big hit with Northwestern University business students that she's been invited to teach another class.
Winfrey, who taught "Dynamics of Leadership" last fall at the university's J.L.
Kellogg School of Management, has accepted an offer to teach again next fall.
The talk-show host has received reviews that were among the strongest of any professor, Assistant Dean Rich Honack said this week.
"Students said she truly provided a class they learned something from," he said.
Winfrey, who taught the class with longtime beau and businessman Stedman Graham, told The Daily Northwestern that she wants to improve.
