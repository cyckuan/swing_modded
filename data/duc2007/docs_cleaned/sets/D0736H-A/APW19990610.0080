Turner Broadcasting System is teaming up with two major magazine publishers to launch a cable television channel aimed at women, going up against the already successful Lifetime channel.
The new channel, which has yet to be named, will be launched together with an accompanying Web site early next year, the companies announced Thursday.
The new service will be headed by Pat Mitchell, who heads the production division at CNN that won a Peabody award for its series on the Cold War.
``Women represent the fastest-growing Internet population and a television audience that remains underserved,'' she said.
``The new network will provide a destination exclusively for smart, active women seeking relevant content and community.''
The companies did not release information about specific programs, but they said the new channel would draw material from style, entertaining, travel, food and parenting articles in the various magazines published by Conde Nast and Time.
Conde Nast publishes Mademoiselle, Vogue, Bride's, Glamour and other magazines.
Time Inc.'s titles include People, InStyle, Parenting, Health and Food Wine.
The new venture would face competition from the successful Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving forces behind the success of Nickelodeon.
While the success of Lifetime could bode well for other channels aimed at women, entertainment industry analysts said it was not yet clear that there was room for all three.
``There's certainly enough topics to be dealt with, but the question is whether there's enough advertising to support three networks in the same area,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. ``It's just too soon to know.''
Mitchell said she thought there was plenty of room for programming aimed at women.
``Lifetime and Oxygen are different from what we're offering.
Women are half of the viewing population, and there's not only room for three or more services targeting women but there's a need for it,'' she said.
