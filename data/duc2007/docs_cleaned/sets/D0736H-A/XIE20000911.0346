Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore appeared on a TV talk show Monday in a bid to attract more women's votes in the November election.
Gore is the first politician invited to the television stage of Oprah Winfrey in Chicago.
Gore's Republican rival George W. Bush is scheduled to appear on September 19 on Winfrey's show, which reaches 22 million viewers weekly.
Reacting to a new Federal Trade Commission report criticizing Hollywood for targeting children with violent products, Gore said they would ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary "cease- fire" in marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to children.
Gore said that if elected, his administration would give entertainment companies six months to clean up their act or face unspecified "tougher measures" under current laws on advertising.
"What we are calling for in this case is industry self- restraint and self-regulation, not censorship," he said.
He said that if the entertainment industry does not change its practice in the six months, it could be found guilty of false advertising.
Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children.
