Most everything about her is geared toward cycling.
Hence the minimalist lifestyle that most would consider quirky but Freedman regards as imperative.
Oh, sure, she'll share in the inevitable laughter when people get a gander at her immobile home in the driveway decorated garishly along the sides and windows with large fruit and other Odwalla insignia.
She'll good-naturedly point out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem that meant the engine couldn't be restarted once it was turned off.
And, though she's now the van lord rather than the resident, she'll chuckle through a guided tour of the interior, featuring a spartan bed on which she's placed a futon; a cabinet console that houses an assortment of nutritional supplements ``I think I take more pills than my 80-year-old grandmother''; the guest room, also known as the passenger seat; the laundry room, formerly the driver's seat; and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of cycling tomes and works ranging from ``Schindler's List'' to Jackie Joyner-Kersee's autobiography.
She's lighthearted about the whole thing, but it's no joke.
She lives this way because she believes it facilitates her cycling.
Freedman prefers New England and intends to settle there, probably in Western Massachusetts, ``because it's more rural.
The people are more family-oriented.
They may lack some of the social graces, but you can know what they're really thinking.
You can know your neighbors.''
But for now, she stays here, living under dorm-like conditions in and outside an obscenely overpriced ramshackle ranch that is a glorified tract house but still rents for $2,875 monthly, this being Silicon Valley and all.
``Ask people why they're here and they say to live for a couple of years and make lots of money,'' says Freedman.
``For them, it's get-rich-quick.
So she sacrifices by subletting, enabling her to share indoor privileges with four fellow transients in a house that is decorated in what best could be described as collegiate dishabille, the major furniture being five bikes hanging from a wall in the foyer.
``It's a cardboard box,'' says Freedman.
But it's worth it because she considers the training conditions here perfect the moderate year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every leaf and rock,'' says her father.
Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind.
She needs her sleep, Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the night.
Meanwhile, unused in the nine-room, four-bedroom family home in Wellesley is Freedman's room.
There a papier-mache monkey that took her a half-year to create in high school still dangles on a makeshift branch from a window, a la Curious George.
But Freedman eschews these familiar niceties and the career track many of her friends now doctors and lawyers and teachers have followed.
She works part time for an on-line women's sports company but is on hiatus now as she devotes all her energies to Olympic preparations.
And she hopes never to have a cursed 9-to-5 desk job, preferring to settle into a career connected with women's sports that will enable her to get out and about.
In the meantime, she follows a trail that almost defies orthodoxy.
``It's because of the way she lives.
She could live where the cost of living is lower, work full time, train less .
And hate every minute of it.
For better or worse, this is Freedman's unique interpretation of the American dream.
And even while her parents who thought she would proceed directly from college into a career cautiously wonder when, if ever, she'll use that bachelor's degree in the marketplace, they applaud her resolve.
``It makes sense to me to pursue what you enjoy doing, not spend your money on frivolous things but on what gives you enjoyment.''
It's just that Marvin and Corey Freedman never envisioned such all-encompassing enjoyment coming from this.
Even when she became an itinerant track apprentice with the Wayfarers, her parents thought sports were a diversion.
``She's the only one in the family who's competitive,'' says Marvin.
And Corey adds, ``We didn't realize she was this competitive.''
Indeed, little did they know.
``We'd go on bike rides to Walden Pond,'' says Dr. Julie Damon, a Freedman friend since sixth grade.
``She always said she wanted to go to the Olympics, but she never specified in what event.''
Certainly not cycling.
At least not on the surface.
But there were hints .
``You could tell track wasn't a love for her,'' says Peggy Kriss, who used to employ Freedman as a baby sitter and will accompany her husband, Cliff Pollan, to Sydney for the road race.
``When she started biking, you knew it was a passion for her.''
Sally Jean Alexander would write accounts of Wayfarers races for various local newspapers, and Nicole took great pleasure in the publicity.
``She always enjoyed the limelight,'' says her mother.
``She liked seeing her name in the paper.''
Still, ``she was competitive in a good way,'' says Dr. Amy Spooner, who has known Freedman since second grade.
``And she basically was good at everything she tried.''
That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the 2-mile, and played tennis.
``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,'' says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh.
``What I found special about her was her toughness.
She was dynamic, a great kid with a great sense of humor.
She's the reason people go into coaching.''
When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular activities as Freedman focused on her studies.
``If I did what I'm best at,'' she says, ``I'd be a mechanical engineer.''
She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her.
For one thing, she wanted to pursue liberal arts.
For another, she wanted a more intensive athletic challenge.
``She found MIT boring,'' says Spooner.
Hello, Stanford.
But once there, Freedman took a major detour, and not just academically.
At the Division 1 level in track, ``I was thoroughly mediocre,'' says Freedman.
``If I fell dead on the track, it wouldn't matter'' to the team.
So after her junior year, she tried another approach.
``If I felt like running, I'd run.''
The first week of this new regime, she felt like running 40 miles.
That proves I'm a runner,' '' she says.
Then she promptly proved she wasn't.
Instead, her footwork involved pedals.
And passion.
Or thoughts about any riding other than recreational.
But Art Walker, coach of the Stanford club team it's not an NCAA-sanctioned sport persuaded her to try competition.
And thus was born an obsession.
Freedman helped Stanford win the informal national college championship, then participated in the Ride Across America.
And she was hooked.
Her parents discovered her addiction almost by accident.
When they visited Corey's relatives in Los Angeles, Nicole joined them by bike.
Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus.
And on excursions to the beach during their stay, Nicole would ride while they would drive.
She'd start out earlier, and she'd always be there to meet them when they arrived, having covered a route that included uphill ascents even Corey considered taxing and she was in a car.
``When I saw how Nicole had gone over the mountains,'' says Corey, ``I was amazed.
Now Nicole is living for the ultimate moment the Olympic race, where she'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly be an amazing acccomplishment.
``It's risk and reward,'' says Miller.
``She'll have a go at it.
It may pay off or she may finish last.''
Either way, she'll embody the ultimate contradiction in her life.
``You get instant gratification.''
If you're long-suffering enough, as Nicole Freedman is.
