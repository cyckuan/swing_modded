From revelations of her own sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
This new version literally brings mental illness into the light.
The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so extreme that it looked gothic.
And though the film was a sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional horrors, like ``The Snake Pit.''
``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the California sun.
The institution where the teen-agers live is filled with windows that let crystal light shine through.
It shines especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one.
Such a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the story of its daring.
Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
The key to this film's approach comes in Ms. Winfrey's introduction.
``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce this story.
With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place where he can begin to feel and trust again.''
Like an extension of the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled intimacy issues.
``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage.
His fear of being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition, but it was there in the original, too.
Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair, buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face.
David is so obsessed with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets everything out.
She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes.
``Nag, nag, dirty hag,'' she taunts her social worker, Maggie (Debi Mazar).
She is a shy, pretty girl, with a childlike innocence and blooming sexuality that the film hints at.
Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly, yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which the entire story depends.
Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
Poitier is used for his iconic presence here.
He can exude authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and often that's what he's called on to do.
At other times he is saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive.''
The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place in the study of psychology in the last three decades.
In one of the rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
(In 1962, schizophrenia was precisely the proud diagnosis David offered.)
Poitier's character says he prefers simple language.
``People have feelings,'' he tells David, who has just said he prefers clocks to humans.
As disappointing as ``David and Lisa'' is, it would be too bad if it became ammunition in the growing Oprah backlash.
The two previous television films she produced, ``Before Women Had Wings'' and ``The Wedding,'' were among the most intelligent and finely wrought network films of the past two years.
Producing and starring in ``Beloved'' was a serious artistic move and Oprah's Book Club is an inspired idea.
``David and Lisa'' comes from the Oprah Winfrey who joins with her audience in group therapy, which is not one of her better roles.
