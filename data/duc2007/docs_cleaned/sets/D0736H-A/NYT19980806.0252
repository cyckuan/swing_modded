Jerry Springer knows how to fight.
As he promised he would do if a kinder, gentler ``Jerry Springer'' suffered in the ratings, daytime's hardest hitting slugger brought his talk show back to the brink of violence in July.
The result: Nielsen ratings, which dropped significantly for the toned-down ``Springer,'' went back up in metro Atlanta as soon as the guest confrontations got uglier.
The return to violence helped ``Springer'' claw its way to a virtual tie with one-time giant ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in July ratings as metro Atlanta's most-watched daytime talk show.
Roughly 145,000 area households tuned in to both shows on average during July.
While that was a 21 percent drop in viewership for ``Springer'' compared to the recent May sweeps, it was still enough to match ``Oprah,'' whose ratings remained virtually unchanged from May and from July a year ago.
Poll on Tailwind Americans see CNN's retraction of its Operation Tailwind story as part of an overall decline in the media's accuracy, according to a poll to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
The poll, conducted July 29-Aug. 2 by telephone of 1,189 adults, found that 49 percent were aware of CNN's retraction of its ``NewsStand'' story, which alleged nerve gas use by the U.S. military.
Asked if Tailwind was an ``isolated incident'' or if ``the news media as a whole is generally less accurate these days,'' 55 percent said they are less accurate overall, and 31 said Tailwind was isolated, with 14 percent not responding.
The research center has also been tracking for three years whether the public thinks news organizations are generally accurate, and finds a steady decline, from 55 percent in 1985 to 34 percent in February 1998.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.
