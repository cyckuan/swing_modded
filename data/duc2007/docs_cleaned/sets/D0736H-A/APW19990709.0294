Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is starting a magazine next spring with the magazine publisher Hearst Corp. Hearst said in a statement that the new magazine will offer articles on community, family, relationships, health and fitness, fashion and beauty, and books.
``This magazine provides a different way for people to be informed and inspired.''
Hearst publishes a variety of major magazines, many of them aimed at women, including Cosomopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Country Living and Harper's Bazaar.
The new magazine, which will debut in the spring with 850,000 copies, will have a cooperative relationship with the Oprah.com Web site.
