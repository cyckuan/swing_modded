lawsuit accusing Oprah Winfrey of using copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book will go to trial next month, a federal judge said.
Judge Ruben Castillo this week issued an opinion saying photographers Paul Natkin and Stephen Green own the copyright on 11 pictures in the book.
But the judge said only a trial can decide whether Winfrey was licensed to put them in ''Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and Better Life.''
Winfrey claims she paid the photographers more than $250,000 for the license to use the pictures not only in the book, but anywhere she wants.
Natkin and Green said the money allowed Winfrey to put the photos in publicity packages for her TV talk show but not in the book.
Winfrey was out of the country and unavailable for comment Wednesday.
But attorney Charles Babcock said she likely would be on hand for the trial and take the stand herself.
''Let's face it,'' he said.
''She'll make an awfully strong witness.''
