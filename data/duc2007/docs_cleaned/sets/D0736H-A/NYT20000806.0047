one of legions, I'm sure declare last week.
Think of what follows as theatrical speculation then, set against a backdrop of some of the dreariest political performances we've yet been subjected to.
George W. Bush got a father figure in Dick Cheney, one who supplies him with authority and stability but who still has to take a back seat when it comes to visibility and sex appeal.
Vice President Al Gore would get a sister with a touch of the mother in Oprah Winfrey; she would give him an aura of spontaneity, generosity and basically sexless titillation.
Tipper Gore's position wouldn't be usurped: The children are there as visible proof of who the real wife is, and Oprah's companion, Steadman Graham, would be by Oprah's side, as proof that everyone goes back to the old neighborhood when day is done.
And there is great mileage to be gotten from a Tipper-Oprah alliance (the Tipper-Hillary combination had no chemistry).
See them together: just girlfriends one moment, women of authority the next, jogging, making speeches, photographed shopping together.
Under Oprah's influence Tipper would show a touch of girlish soulfulness, while Oprah could add chipper gentility to her repertory.
Graham's influence should not be minimized either.
He would appeal greatly to all those unmarried couples who become inadmissible evidence whenever politicians start testifying about family values.
And he could set an example for men across the country who may one day find themselves, if they haven't already, less famous, less wealthy and less powerful than their wives or lovers.
An aside here.
Maybe it's like what architects or designers do when they take old materials and arrange them differently: keep the comforting associations of the past, while getting the excitement of the present and future.
(``These people are black; I know what that has meant and could still mean, but I feel completely different!'')
Oprah Winfrey and Colin Powell have this value.
So do certain actors who have become the voices and bodies of American industry and technology.
There is James Earl Jones as the body and cellular soul of Verizon Telephone and Ruby Dee as the voice of life insurance.
(It's a nurturing concept, life insurance; it needs a woman's voice.)
And there is Avery Brooks.
He first rose to television fame as the black hustler helpmate of a white private eye on ``Spenser: For Hire.''
He now commands a space station on ``Deep Space 9'' and embodies the technological prowess of IBM here on earth.
But no one has achieved Oprah's well-nigh superhuman status.
Look at the cover of her new monthly magazine, still on newsstands.
Read ``O'' in white boldface with ``The Oprah Magazine'' just below in a bright square of color, then let your eye move to a full-page photograph of the woman herself.
This is not a magazine title along the lines of Jane or the now-defunct Mirabella.
This is not a proper noun; it is an idea or way of life, like Vogue; even a species, along the lines of People.
And with its emphasis on physical, psychological and spiritual evolution, there is the hint that a new species or at least a new, improved gender is in the offing.
Both in her magazine and on her television show, Oprah's name is used in a queenly manner.
Implicitly, her ``I'' is a royal ``we'': she speaks for us as well as to us.
(Don't you wish that Diana, Princess of Wales, had been a guest on her show?
That would have been one for the ages.)
But the process works in reverse, too.
We can be in fact we are every day royalty, striving for the same kinds of material and spiritual blessings Oprah strives for and, in the case of material blessings, clearly has won.
What's hers is ours, it seems: the magazine's sensible psychologist, Dr. Phillip C. McGraw, and its spiritual advice giver, Gary Zukav, both appear on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah's personal counselors.
Her cook appears too, as do members of her book club.
What a brilliant businesswoman and media star: mogul plus .
Now she is a national care giver, a national therapist (how smart she was to play Ellen DeGeneres' therapist on the episode in which she came out) and a philanthropist.
Remember the ``fabulously wealthy'' John Beresford Tipton on that old television show ``The Millionaire,'' who anonymously bestowed fortunes on ordinary citizens to see if they could use the money wisely and become better people?
Oprah is a real-life extension of this fantasy, bestowing gifts on her television audiences food, CDs, Palm Pilots and opportunities for self-enhancement and self-discipline on all her fans.
``Live Your Best Life!''
The magazine teaches informed selflessness and enlightened selfishness.
And it does so very well, adapting and expanding on elements of women's, general interest and celebrity magazines.
Learn to control your temper; learn to give yourself flowers and candles; learn about community organizers and how to become one yourself; learn how famous women cured themselves of ``the disease to please''; take the pull-outs of quotes from famous people (the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Epictetus, Joe E. Lewis) and tape them to your mirror or mail them to friends.
The current issue is laid out like a four-step program.
The articles in ``First Words'' are about improving one's life in the world, from handling money to learning from failure.
Then comes ``Live Your Best Life'' with an inward focus: how to meditate, how to give yourself solitude.
Now you are ready for pleasure: ``Enjoy Yourself'' with fashion, health and beauty ideas.
And lastly come ``Features,'' which include Oprah's interview with a famous woman (Jane Fonda here), profiles, pieces on sex and on aging, and, from other famous women (Hillary Clinton this time), books that have made a difference in their lives.
The magazine ends with a brief coda called ``.
There is a full page of beauty products meant to ``go with'' the articles you have just read on fashion, food and the home.
And there is Oprah's last word, a spiritual anecdote called ``What I Know for Sure,'' with one last photograph.
Why would Oprah Winfrey need to be a politician?
She is already a business impresario and a media empress.
