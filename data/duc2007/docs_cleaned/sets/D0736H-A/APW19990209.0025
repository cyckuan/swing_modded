especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready to bail out of her long-running show.
``My contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows because I feel they are going to burn themselves out.''
Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in September 1986.
Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her stint on the movie set.
``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said.
Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling his show a ``vulgarity circus.''
Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a publicist in Chicago.
Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of her current contract.
