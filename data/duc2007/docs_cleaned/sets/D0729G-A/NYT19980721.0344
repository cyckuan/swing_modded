Federal law enforcement officers have settled into what they expect to be a slow and arduous search for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph.
Tuesday, the searchers concentrated on an area of the Nantahala Forest near the house Rudolph's family moved into when he was 14, officials said.
Meanwhile, mechanics in Atlanta were examining a 1977 Nissan pickup truck, trying to determine how far Rudolph may have driven it.
The truck was taken from an elderly Nantahala man the night of July 9 and abandoned nearby with two flat tires on July 13.
''We're having experts examine it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
George Nordmann, 71, reported the truck and about six months of food stolen on July 11.
Near Nordmann's home, which has been a focal point of the renewed searching in the past week, investigators found an observation point and a campsite.
They believe Rudolph watched Nordmann's residence for several days.
His thumbprint has been identified on a food wrapper at the observation point, investigators said Tuesday.
Investigators also were trying to determine if a boot print matched the Danner boots Rudolph bought from a Nantahala outlet, they said.
But the boots are a popular brand, worn by many hikers and even by searchers for Rudolph.
Rudolph had not been seen since Jan. 30, the day after the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police officer and severely injured a nurse.
Agents are moving slowly, partly for fear of booby traps, officers said.
Agents want to question Rudolph in three bombings in Atlanta the July 1996 explosion in Centennial Olympic Park and the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and a gay nightclub.
Investigators believe those bombs may have targeted police.
''We're working systematically very, very hard in arduous conditions,'' Killorin said.
''This is what we know.
The man is in the area.
We've confirmed that.
Absolutely, we're very careful because this person is wanted for a homicide bombing.''
