nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect Eric Robert Rudolph, partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book or movie, her attorney said.
Emily Lyons and her husband, Jeff, are also seeking damages in the suit against Rudolph, which they filed Thursday in federal court.
``She feels very strongly that he should never profit from his conduct involving the clinic,'' said her attorney, Scott Powell.
Lyons was arriving for work when a bomb exploded Jan. 29, 1998, outside New Woman All Women Health Care.
The blast killed an off-duty Birmingham policeman.
Lyons lost her left eye and has undergone numerous operations.
Rudolph is charged in six bombings, including the 1996 Centennial Park blast during the Olympic Games in Atlanta that killed one person and injured 100 others.
Law enforcement has searched for Rudolph for more than two years, focusing on remote areas in western North Carolina near his home.
