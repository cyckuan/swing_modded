But they declined to say what the evidence was.
The FBI's Woody Enderson, inspector in charge of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, stopped short of calling Rudolph a suspect in the Atlanta cases.
During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub.
``That is a (U.S.) Department of Justice decision,'' he said.
Agents have said they want to question Rudolph in those bombings and that they are in no hurry to charge him in the Atlanta cases, because they have a warrant for him in the Jan. 29 bombing in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.
Asked Monday if they had tied Rudolph to the Atlanta crimes, Enderson said, ``We've developed additional evidence'' since January.
Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan. 30 into the western North Carolina mountains.
Sales receipts showed he had six months' worth of food, including BI-LO California raisins, BI-LO Harvest Choice Cut Green Beans, BI-LO Old Fashioned Oatmeal, Planters Peanuts and Star Kist Tuna.
Monday's news conference was called to display those items for bear hunters, in the hope their dogs will unearth the remains and wrappers when bear season begins Oct. 12.
``To us, these items and their packaging represent evidence,'' Enderson said.
``But to Eric Rudolph, most of this is now nothing but trash.''
Agents found trash in July after Rudolph came out of the woods to get six more months of food, NOW and Nature's Plus minerals and vitamins, supplies and a truck from George Nordmann, a 71-year-old Andrews health food store owner.
Nordmann was away when the truck was taken.
For the first time Monday, Enderson said Rudolph was ``given'' some of those items ``in an encounter with a local witness.''
Nordmann has not been charged with aiding Rudolph.
Rudolph also has a brown paper bag the texture of a dog food bag and Cayenne pepper that could be used to try to disguise his scent from bloodhounds, Enderson said.
