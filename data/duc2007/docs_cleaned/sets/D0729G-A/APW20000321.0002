The task force that has hunted serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of June.
''Eric Rudolph has not escaped justice, he has just delayed it,'' Steven McCraw, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said Monday.
''The trail is cold, yet all evidence suggests he's here, he's alone and he's alive.''
Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
Hours after the Birmingham bombing, a truck seen near the explosion site was traced to Rudolph.
Rudolph rented a video in Murphy, N.C., that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies and vanished.
His truck was found near here several days later.
But dogs, searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have failed to find Rudolph, an Army veteran and survivalist, in the dense mountain forests.
Agents stopped actively searching in the woods in August, after McCraw took the job, he said.
McCraw said in his first public appearance since then that he's leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C.
Agents will remain in Andrews, and a local coordinator will report to FBI officials in Atlanta, McCraw said.
There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his disappearance, in July 1998.
McCraw said Rudolph may have been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic evidence.
Others say he might have left the region.
