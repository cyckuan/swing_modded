Eric Rudolph may be hiding in a cave just up the hill from this western North Carolina town that cherishes how far out in the wilderness it is.
Or he may be thousands of miles away.
There are about as many theories to the bombing suspect's whereabouts as there are potential hiding places.
Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic.
They think he's still somewhere around here, probably in an old mine within the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest.
But not everyone thinks Rudolph, an experienced backwoodsman who would have just celebrated his 33rd birthday, is still hidden in these woods.
He's not around here,'' said George Nordmann, during a recent interview in his Better Way Health Foods store in downtown Andrews.
Nordmann said he has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the 72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last person to have seen Rudolph.
In July 1998, Rudolph took about six months' worth of supplies and a pickup truck from Nordmann.
The encounter happened on a Thursday, but Nordmann did not report it to authorities for two days.
The truck was found two days later near the entrance to a campground just east of here in Macon County.
Nordmann gave authorities a detailed description of Rudolph.
The suspect had apparently added a beard and a ponytail.
The information did not lead to a quick capture.
Instead, Rudolph, who is a suspect not just in the Birmingham bombing but also in three Atlanta-area bombings in 1996 and 1997 including a fatal blast at Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, remains at large.
He has survived one winter on the run, despite predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and the temperature dropped, he would be caught.
Other than Rudolph's connection with Nordmann and the discovery of buried trash with the suspect's fingerprints on it, federal agents have not disclosed much about their search.
With winter approaching, officials familiar with the search said that federal agents will continue to focus on the mountainous, rugged area around Macon County.
The task force heading up the search has had a change in leadership in recent months.
Will Eric Rudolph be caught?
It's a question that many people here say they once were preoccupied with but now just don't care about.
Rudolph, a native of the area who attended Nantahala High School, has become as much a living part of folklore as a suspect on the run.
The TV trucks are gone and so is the ostensible federal presence.
Around Andrews and the small communities that lead into the mountains, the talk has turned to foliage ( a fairly spectacular season), high school football (the Brevard Blue Devils are ranked No.
