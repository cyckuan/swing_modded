The deadly nail bombings, which investigators have said are related, began with the Atlanta Olympics in July 1996 and ended with the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
As one of the most extensive manhunts in recent American history nears its one-year anniversary, Woody Enderson, the FBI special agent in charge of the multiagency Southeast Bomb Task Force, said authorities think the fact that there have been no more bombings since the fatal Alabama attack means that suspect Rudolph is their man.
Some 200 federal and state officers continue to search the rugged mountains of the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest for the former soldier and self-employed carpenter.
Rudolph, 32, who grew up exploring these mountains, is said by friends and family to be an expert outdoorsman.
Enderson said authorities think he may be hiding in a bunker, abandoned mine or cave.
In addition, he said, a number of burglaries of mountain cabins and sightings of unidentified persons by residents in recent months lead authorities to believe Rudolph is still in the mountains.
``We know an awful lot about Eric Rudolph from friends and associates.
From going into great detail about his background, we know he feels very comfortable in this area,'' Enderson said.
``Everything we know about him leads us to believe that he will not leave this area.''
Rudolph apparently fled into the wilderness the day after the Birmingham attack once he realized authorities were on his trail.
That information led agents to his rented mobile home near Murphy, N.C. Rudolph surfaced briefly in July to obtain food from a friend and again disappeared into mountains.
Enderson said agents believe the food is now running low and he will soon make a move to obtain more.
In addition to the Birmingham and Olympic bombings, Rudolph is charged with the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
The Birmingham attack killed an off-duty police officer working as a security guard at the clinic and seriously wounded a nurse.
The Centennial Olympic Park explosion killed one person and injured 111.
