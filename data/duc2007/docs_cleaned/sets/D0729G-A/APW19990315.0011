Federal investigators said Monday that they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but they aren't ruling him out, either.
The bomb partially detonated on Saturday morning outside the Femcare Clinic in Asheville, about 75 miles west of the mountains where agents have been searching for Rudolph for more than a year.
No one was hurt in the blast, which caused little damage other than leaving black marks on the outside of the one-story brick building.
``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said.
``It is too early, of course, to draw any conclusions.
Richard Fox, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the powerful bomb could have ``devastated the entire end of the building and gone into the building approximately 40 to 60 feet.''
Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a nurse.
He is charged in that bombing and three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one person.
