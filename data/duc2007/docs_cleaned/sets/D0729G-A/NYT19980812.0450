Weaver, of the infamous Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho, knows all too well what Rudolph is up against.
The standoff ended 11 days later, with Weaver wounded and his wife and son dead.
Never again do federal agents want another Ruby Ridge.
They have said that once they find Rudolph's hiding place, it could take weeks, even months to negotiate him out.
Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force say they know Rudolph is armed with long guns.
Investigators said tests conducted at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) lab in Atlanta has detected dynamite residue in both trucks one was his and one he allegedly stole that Rudolph has driven since the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in Birmingham.
Rudolph is wanted for questioning in connection with the deadly July 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, January 1997 double-blast at an Atlanta-area abortion clinic and a February 1997 blast at a gay Atlanta nightclub.
His mother, Pat Rudolph, has released statements of concern for her son's life and the safety of the lawmen tracking him.
Weaver will appeal to Mrs. Rudolph, who lives in Florida but is currently in North Carolina, that her son should give himself up, said Vicci Gritz, the former soldier's daughter-in-law.
``They (federal agents) feel like she might have some kind of contact with him somehow,'' Vicci Gritz said.
``Randy will reason with her so she can reason with him.''
Federal officials had no comment about the claim that Pat Rudolph talks to her son, probably by telephone.
``When they searched Eric Rudolph's home, he had some of our training videos,'' Vicci Gritz said.
``We have not had any contact with him.''
Gritz, 59, who has a daily radio show that can be picked up on shortwave, plans to muster at least 100 volunteers to go into the mountains this weekend.
Any participants must sign a waiver of the reward, because Gritz has promised it to Rudolph's mother to use for his defense.
That tactic had not been embraced by the FBI Wednesday, Vicci Gritz said.
But that's all Gritz may have to offer Rudolph, who could face the death penalty.
``(Gritz) cannot trust the government unless he gets something in writing.
Today they may say something and tomorrow say another, depending on which way the political winds are blowing.''
Doug Jones, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and the death penalty.
``Under Justice Department guidelines, we can't make that decision until he's in custody and indicted,'' Jones said.
``It's my understanding that that decision will be made in Washington.
There will be a recommendation from our office, but the ultimate decision will be left in the hands of the (U.S.) attorney general.''
Ressler said death by lethal injection will never deter some of today's new brand of terrorists.
``Using the death penalty to prevent acts of terrorism is a joke,'' he said.
``If you are mission oriented and willing to die for the cause....the death penalty is nothing more than a political football.''
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta ATF office has said investigators believe Rudolph is on an unfinished mission.
Investigators said that might include hurting a group of agents or even media workers.
Investigators have said all along that Rudolph was hiding in the Nantahala where he spent his adolescence honing his skills in the woods .
It's where he is the most comfortable.
Killorin has said it was not Rudolph's intention to run away or leave the country.
His intentions, investigators said they believe, are to finish the job he started.
``If his ultimate plan is to finish his mission, he's a very dangerous man,''Ressler said.
``Rather than negotiate, I think it's imperative to nail him and get him under control.''
