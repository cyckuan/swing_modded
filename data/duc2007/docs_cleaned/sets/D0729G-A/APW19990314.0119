Authorities did not discount a possible connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing Rudolph on Sunday.
The clinic is about 75 miles east of the mountainous area where Rudolph is believed to be hiding.
When asked Saturday about a possible link between the explosion and Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, we don't discount anything.''
On Sunday, several FBI agents worked the scene outside the one-story brick building that houses the Femcare Clinic, where the bomb exploded early Saturday morning.
Nobody was injured and there was little damage because the device only partially detonated.
``The investigation is still going on,'' said Asheville Police Sgt.
Randy Riddle, who escorted news crews closer to the bombing scene Sunday.
Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium anthrax.
Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics.
Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the run since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a nurse.
Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one person.
