Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that a Macon County, N.C., man who reported his truck stolen knew Rudolph and had seen him in recent days.
What was unclear to investigators was why the pickup was not reported stolen immediately, giving Rudolph time to escape with another six months' worth of food, which he is believed to have stolen from the owner of the truck.
Investigators said this does not mean that the owner of the truck, identified by the Associated Press and WSB-TV as George Nordmann, operator of The Better Way Health Food Store, was trying to help Rudolph.
``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph.
``What would you do?''
Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force investigating the Birmingham bombing and Atlanta bombings: ``This is a witness of ours.''
Nordmann's 1977 blue Datsun pickup truck was recovered Monday shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C. Investigators said Nordmann told them the pickup truck was stolen Thursday, along with a large amount of food.
News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was a friend.
And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
The man waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according to ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great hiding place.
News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were found on the pickup.
``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we may,'' the ATF agent said.
Investigators indicated they believe they are closer to Rudolph than they have been since he was named in February as a suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured a nurse.
At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson of the bomb task force declared, ``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph.''
Investigators believe they may have missed the 31-year-old carpenter and experienced outdoorsman by just hours Monday.
``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
The ATF official said a local law enforcement officer had passed through the area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found Monday and that the truck was not there.
``It was not in the location where it was found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,'' Killorin said.
Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
Enderson said Rudolph, who as a teenager moved with his mother and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has re-energized the manhunt.
Rudolph had last been reported seen at a video store in Murphy on Jan. 30.
Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of the forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters in Andrews.
Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at 1-888-ATF- BOMB.
All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
They also believed he was acting alone.
``We still believe that,'' Enderson said.
``The search has been intensified significantly.''
The number of agents in western North Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared into the woods.
``He had stolen another six months worth, or at least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is dangerous.
``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
The truck, which was first approached as if it might be boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks that reach 4,500 to 5,000 feet into the sky.
``The foilage is so thick you can't see ... you can't find anything,'' Thompson said.
