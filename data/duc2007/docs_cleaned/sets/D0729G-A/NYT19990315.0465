Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
At a news conference in Asheville, federal investigators were careful to say that they had not definitively excluded Rudolph as a suspect.
But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.
``We're saying at this time that we have no evidence that this is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' said Mark Calloway, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.
``But it's early in the investigation, and we're not drawing any conclusions at this time.''
Woody Enderson, the FBI agent directing the task force that is searching for Rudolph, said in a statement that ``there is no reason to believe'' that Rudolph has any connection to the Asheville attack.
Another federal investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was even more explicit.
``We see no linkage,'' the law-enforcement official said.
``This device is much different than the devices associated with Rudolph.
In a world where anything is possible, I can't slam any doors because we don't have Rudolph in custody and we don't know who did it in Asheville.
But there are a lot of differences.''
Investigators have painstakingly analyzed the components of the bombs Rudolph is accused of building, and have found numerous similarities between their parts and their design.
The bomb in Asheville exploded shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday outside the Femcare Clinic, the only abortion provider in western North Carolina.
The clinic was scheduled to open at 8 a.m. No one was injured, and the bomb caused little damage because it did not fully detonate.
There were no warnings before the blast, and no person or group has claimed responsibility.
The Femcare Clinic has never been hit by a violent attack, but it has been the site of regular protests by anti-abortion demonstrators.
It also received a hoax letter that purported to contain anthrax last month and a threatening telephone call last July, Calloway said.
If the bomb had fully detonated, the damage would have been severe, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in North Carolina.
``It would have devastated that entire end of the building and penetrated into the building some approximately 40 feet or so to 60 feet, with fairly complete destruction,'' Fox said.
Because the bomb did not explode completely, investigators have gathered far more information about its components than is usually possible.
Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a fugitive since Jan. 30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.
Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan. 16, 1997, bombing of a north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the Feb. 21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay clientele.
The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police officer in Birmingham, and injured 124.
Rudolph remains on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives.
