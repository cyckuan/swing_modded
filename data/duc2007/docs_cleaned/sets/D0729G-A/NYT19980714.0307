After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon, federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of 35.
Bloodhounds also were tracking the fugitive.
``We think we have the resources that we will find him,'' said Woody Enderson, the FBI agent who directs the multiagency Southeast Bombing Task Force.
The sighting last Thursday was clearly the most encouraging lead in a frustrating search that has taken investigators across hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain since Jan. 29, when a bomb exploded outside the New Woman All Women Health Care Center, in Birmingham, Ala.
The bombing killed an off-duty policeman who was working as a security guard at the clinic and seriously injured a nurse.
Witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the explosion, and the North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to Rudolph.
``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know for sure that he's in this area and that we are able to focus in on a much smaller area than we have before,'' said Enderson.
Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter with ties to extremist religious groups, also is wanted for questioning in three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997, including the July 27, 1996, explosion at Centennial Olympic Park.
That explosion killed one woman and injured 111 people.
Seven people were injured in a pair of explosions on Jan. 27, 1997, outside a building housing an abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburbs, and five were injured in a Feb. 21, 1997, bombing at a gay nightclub in midtown Atlanta.
Although Rudolph has only been formally charged in the Birmingham bombing, forensic evidence suggests that he may have been responsible for the Atlanta bombings as well, investigators have said.
In early May, the FBI placed Rudolph on its list of the 10 most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
Enderson said that the man identified as Rudolph had appeared on Thursday evening at a residence near Nantahala Lake, not far from where Rudolph once lived.
He said the fugitive took a blue 1977 Nissan pickup truck from the occupant of the residence, whom he did not identify.
He said Rudolph also took a large amount of food from the resident, possibly enough to sustain him for five or six months.
The authorities said the resident provided a description that enabled them to produce a new sketch of the previously clean-shaven Rudolph, showing him thinner, bearded and sporting a ponytail.
He was last seen wearing camouflage fatigues, a camouflage jacket and gloves, they said.
Enderson declined to say specifically whether the resident knew Rudolph.
``Keep in mind that pretty much in this whole area, people know each other,'' he said.
``The extent of the association I'm not going to discuss.''
It was found, broken down and abandoned, at about noon on Monday at the Bob Allison Campground, a picnic area in the Nantahala National Forest, the official said.
The official also said that authorities found a note inside the truck explaining who it belonged to, and they identified the handwriting as Rudolph's.
``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph,'' Enderson said.
The law enforcement official said the truck apparently was not at the picnic area 18 hours before it was found, meaning that Rudolph has less than a day's head start on his pursuers.
Enderson said that his troops had been energized by the sighting of Rudolph.
And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North Carolina.
Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was hiding in the familiar woods near his home.
``We've said all along that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting alone,'' Enderson said.
``We still believe that.''
