In a sign that agents may have found fresh footprints of the Birmingham bombing suspect in the Nantahala National Forest, federal agents Monday returned to the store where Rudolph bought a pair of boots in 1994.
They came and asked if they could see the boot that Eric bought,'' said Kathy Jo Roper of Roper's Boot Store in the nearby rural community of Topton.
``They took the boot outside and made impressions in the sand and dirt outside.''
Agents visited the store in February during the early days of the now six-month-old manhunt for Rudolph.
At the time they purchased a pair of the same style and size of Danner insulated hunting boots bought by Rudolph.
It was unclear why agents returned for more boots, and U.S. Justice Department spokesman Patrick Crosby declined comment.
Atlanta's WBS-TV, citing sources, reported Monday that searchers had found a fingerprint matching Rudolph's at an abandoned campsite.
At a press briefing Monday, the chief of the Southeast Bomb Taskforce said teams skilled in tracking are combing the surrounding mountains.
The teams include tracking dogs and heavily armed tactical units of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said taskforce chief Woody Enderson.
They are searching an area known as the Tusquitee range, which has 5,000-foot-high peaks, dense hardwood forests and thickets of rhododendron that are virtually impenetrable.
``It's not impossible for a team to to cover 10 to 15 miles in a day,'' Enderson said.
``We've covered 10 square miles since last week...
It's progress as well as we could hope.''
Rudolph, 31, is charged with bombing a Birmingham abortion clinic Jan. 29, killing an off-duty policeman who was moonlighting as a security guard and severely wounded a nurse.
He also is wanted for questioning in three Atlanta bombings, including the 1996 Olympics blast that killed one and injured more than 100.
Until he emerged July 9 and obtained food, Rudolph had not been seen early February, when his abandoned pickup truck was found outside Murphy.
