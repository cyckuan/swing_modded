More than 200 local, state and federal officials from North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama were on the ground Thursday, searching a 30-square-mile area for the experienced survivalist.
The renewed search has rapidly expanded since Rudolph showed up at the Nantahala residence of an acquaintance July 7 with a list of provisions he needed and $500 in cash to pay for them with.
Although investigators found a spot where they believe Rudolph watched the home of George Nordmann, 71, for several days, the fugitive has vanished again, leaving no trail.
``Obviously, he's pretty good at it,'' Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said.
Bob Scott, a member of the North Carolina Civil Air Patrol and an experienced tracker, said searchers at times have spent months looking for a single lost airplane in the area.
``In one case, we lost a pretty good sized single engine Cessna airplane for 18 months and it was 50 yards from a main highway,'' Scott said.
``They bend the trees and make a canopy.
That's what he's got right nowa canopy.''
The dry weather also hinders the bloodhounds, investigators said.
Dampness holds in the scent.
Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force had been ``re-energized'' after Nordmann came forward Saturday with his report of seeing Rudolph.
He told them Rudolph stole his 1977 Datsun pickup truck on July 9 and took about six months' worth of food.
Since that time, other ``solid leads'' have come in from the community, but Woody Enderson, FBI inspector in charge of the task force, would not characterize the tips.
``We are not going to talk about exact locations of the search, details about witnesses and what they have told us, or the exact operations that are going on right now,'' Enderson said.
``Eric Rudolph is still considered armed and dangerous.
He has specialized knowledge that makes him especially dangerous in the heavily wooded areas where we are looking.''
