Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the 1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout, investigators said.
The FBI's Woody Enderson appealed again Wednesday for help from anyone who may have seen the blue truck between the night of July 9 and about noon July 13 when it was discovered.
''We already have some information from witnesses that during the time it was being driven by Eric Rudolph, the truck made a lot of noise,'' Enderson said at a news conference.
''It is possible that the truck may have been driven some distance out of the forest area, and later back in again to where it was found.
Again, the truck did not run well but still may have put on as much as a few dozen miles, so again we are asking anyone who may have seen or heard that loud-sounding blue .
While investigators continued searching Wednesday, the widow of the police officer killed in the Birmingham bombing, and the host and a crew for the ``America's Most Wanted'' television show flew into town.
Rudolph is a suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed Robert Sanderson and injured nurse Emily Lyons.
Felecia Sanderson said Wednesday she decided to come to the North Carolina mountains to appear on ``America's Most Wanted'' after watching news reports in which some residents said they would help Rudolph.
``Some people called him a folk hero,'' she said before being interviewed by the show's host, John Walsh, for a segment that will be broadcast Saturday.
``He's a murderer.
He's a terrorist.''
``We're going to bring in the pressure of a prime-time TV show,'' Walsh said.
``Someone may just see Eric Rudolph.''
Rudolph has been a subject of several previous shows.
During a routine briefing Wednesday, Enderson confirmed the existence of a ''number of small campsites'' in the search area, which has been focused around Nordmann's home, the campground where the truck was found and the Rudolph family's former home, where he spent most of his teenage years.
All are in the Nantahala Forest, and investigators have said their search area encompasses about 30 square miles.
''At one of those sites, we found trash buried in the ground, and Eric Rudolph's fingerprint was identified on one of the pieces of trash,'' Enderson said.
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said the print was on a food wrapper at a site they where Rudolph is believed to have perched to watch Nordmann's house for several days before approaching Nordmann on July 7.
Sheriff Jack Thompson of Cherokee County, N.C., said Wednesday that the campsites were in rugged terrain.
''He may have a radio.
He's got batteries, I understand.''
''This remains a difficult and potentially dangerous day and night search operation,'' Enderson said.
''We are still using every means available, including canine, aerial and electronic methods.''
