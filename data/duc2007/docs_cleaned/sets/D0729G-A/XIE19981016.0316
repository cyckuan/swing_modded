Federal authorites charged Eric Robert Rudolph the elusive fugitive sought in the bomb of the Olympic park bombing of 1996 and two other Atlanta-area terroist attacks Wedensday.
"This warrant moves us one step closer to ending a campaign of violence," said John Magaw of the Bureau of Alcoho, Tobacco and Firearms.
In addition to the Olympics bombing, Rudolph was formally charged in last year's attacks against a north Atlanta abortion clinic and a local gay nightclub.
Nine people were injured in those explosions.
In Febraury, Rudolph was charged with this year's bombing of a clinic in Birminghan.
Two people died and 100 were injured in the Olympics bombing.
Nails and steel plates recovered from the Olympic park and Atlanta clinic bomb sites were similar, authorites said.
The similarities helped authorities link Rudolph to the bombings, they said.
They would not elaborate.
His name was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list this year, and a 1 million U.S. dollars award has been offered for information leading to his conviction.
In announcing the new charges, federal officials solicited the public's help in capturing Rudolph.
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh released a photograph showing Rudolph in khaki shorts and a green T-shirt that investigators believe Rudolph was wearing in Atlanda the day of the Olympics blast.
Since January, Rudolph has been the subject of a massive manhunt focused in Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina, near his hometown of Murphy.
At times as many as 200 agents beat through the rugged terrain searching for Rudolph, an experienced outdoorsman.
"Eric Rudolph is on the run," Reno said.
"Hundreds of agents are on his tail."
Authorities fear that Rudolph is getting help, possibly from anti-abortion sympathizers.
