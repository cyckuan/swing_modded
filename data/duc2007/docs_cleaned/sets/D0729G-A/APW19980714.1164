The manhunt intensified again for abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last week.
Rudolph, on the run nearly six months following the Alabama bombing, was seen Thursday by the man officials say he robbed.
He disappeared after ditching the truck at a campground that leads into the mountains and areas honeycombed with caves, according to authorities.
Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man, who operates a health food store.
However ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was a friend.
And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
Rudolph's friend waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great hiding place.
News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
Calls to authorities by The Associated Press seeking comment on the reports weren't immediately returned Tuesday night.
The area where Rudolph disappeared is at the southern tip of the Appalachians.
Members of the Southeast Bombing Task Force converged on this area near the tip of western North Carolina with bloodhounds and extra manpower.
Rudolph, a 31-year-old outdoorsman and carpenter, is charged in the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic, which killed an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse in Birmingham, Alabama.
He also is wanted for questioning three bombings in Georgia, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Park bombing.
The FBI placed Rudolph on its 10 most wanted list on May 6 and increased the reward to dlrs 1 million for anyone with information leading to his arrest and conviction.
Since he was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has evaded a nationwide search.
The reward for information leading to his capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100.
The other attacks in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and at a gay nightclub in February 1997.
