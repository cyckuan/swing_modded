Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been put out thanks to the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Sunday.
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's devastating earthquake has been put out with the help of foreign countries.
Kocaeli is the most seriously devastated province after the monster quake hit the western Turkey.
However, he said the strong fire had destroyed seven storage tanks and damaged two other ones in the refinery which held 30 storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
He said the blaze in the refinery was brought under control on Friday and only one storage tank was burning at that time, adding that one chimney in the refinery had collapsed.
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia participated in the fight against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of the 30 storage tanks.
Turkish experts are expected to make research about the pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the Izmit Refinery.
