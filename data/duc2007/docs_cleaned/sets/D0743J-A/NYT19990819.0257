Nuri Tekin shuffled to the back entrance of the city's prized indoor skating rink, looking for his nephew.
Inside, people in green surgical masks walked gingerly, using flashlights to cut the misty darkness, up and down rows of horizontal, covered shapes on the ice.
Numbly handing over Recet Tekin's identity card to a woman at a desk by the entranceway, he was told he now could take with him Number 415 just a blanketed bundle on watery, puddly ice the body of his 15-year-old nephew.
``We have identified almost all of them,'' said Suna, the city employee behind the desk, a surgical mask around her neck and a look of exhaustion in her eyes as she tried to put yellow slips of paper on all the bodies being brought to this just-completed rink.
Over the clacking of a generator laboring to keep the ice solid in sweltering heat, Tekin tried to connect the inert figure one of more than 500 bodies inside the rink, one of more than 7,000 people who perished in Turkey's deadliest quake in six decades with the boy he had loved.
``He died when our building collapsed,'' Tekin managed to say, ``now we have come to bury him.''
Words seem insufficient to describe the changed state of this seaside city, near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake.
Behind Tekin, dozens of still-dazed people stood at the edge of the rink's parking lot, many crying.
``No, I don't want to go in!''
``Our grandson, we are looking for him,'' sobbed his wife as she tugged at her husband's arm.
Nearly 72 hours after an earthquake leveled thousands of buildings in an arc stretching from the outskirts of Istanbul through the industrial heartland of Izmit, the search for survivors is turning into a collection of the dead.
With official morgues long filled, any place that offers temperatures cold enough to stop bodies from decaying are being pressed into service.
But with the fear of disease rising, not even the makeshift morgues or the cemeteries working overtime can cover the number of bodies being dug out of the rubble.
In scores of devastated areas, the odor of rotting flesh is wafting through the wreckage.
And in one town east of Izmit, Sakarya, authorities have buried 1,000 bodies in a mass grave.
Throughout Izmit and many communities in northwestern Turkey, neighborhoods were leveled, electric wires are down, water lines have been cut, roads cracked and bridges collapsed.
The country's stock market has been shut since the quake, parliament was recessed and phone lines in areas hit hard are only partly being restored.
To protect against explosions, natural gas lines running through heavily damaged areas have been turned off.
Towns around Izmit's state-owned oil refinery Tupras were evacuated because of the fires that broke out in the oil storage tanks after the earthquake.
Low-flying planes Thursday dropped special chemicals on the tanks, which spewed out flames into a sky so black with smoke that at midday the sun was blocked in this area just outside Izmit city.
But officials said the fires were coming under control, with a diminishing risk of flames igniting tanks holding liquefied petroleum gas, which would send poisonous chemicals into the air.
``After 36 hours the chances of someone surviving in the rubble drops by 50 percent and after five days it's more a miracle than anything else if someone can be brought out alive,'' said Ellinor Von Kauffungen, from the Swiss Disaster Relief organization.
She was part of a team of some 10 orange-suited Swiss rescue workers desperately trying to reach two young men buried, but still alive, under about 20 feet of rubble of what once was a five-story apartment building.
``My nephew's son Recep was going to go the next day back to the army and there was a party for him that night when the earthquake hit,'' said Bayram Bayraktar, standing anxiously at the edge of the collapsed building.
``For two days we dug with our own hands to try and reach people, and we managed to get some 15 people out, but we could not get to Recep and his friend all I could tell them was to stay calm and maybe help would come,'' said Bayraktar, who lost eight relatives in the quake.
But despite the hope of life for Bayraktar's nephew and his friend, many people in Izmit city and the province, where some 1.4 million people live, were looking for the dead.
The sign was often a bulldozer pushing through the rubble, which meant it no longer mattered if concrete blocks shifted wildly because nobody was left alive.
Thursday night, Turkish officials, worried about the chance of dangerous aftershocks, ordered millions of people still in their buildings to sleep outside.
In Istanbul, where some 1,000 people died in the quake, tens of thousands of terrified residents streamed into parks to spend the night.
