Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Saturday.
Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with the help of foreign countries.
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia have been participating in the fight against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30 storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
The fire fighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to control the flames in the Izmit Refinery, about 110 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
Alakoc added that the fire has burnt 250,000 tons of the crude oil in the Turkey's largest oil refinery.
Turkish experts are expected to make research for the pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the Izmit Refinery, he said.
Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey.
Many taxi drivers in Istanbul have been lining up for filling LPG as the Izmit Refinery stopped supplying petrol to the city.
