Some 12,040 people have so far been confirmed dead in Tuesday's killer earthquake in northwest Turkey and 33,495 others were reported as injured, the Government Crisis Center of Turkey announced Sunday morning.
According to the latest statistics, Kocaeli (Izmit) province posted the highest casualty as 5,179 bodies had been discovered and 14,718 people were injured.
Sakarya (Adapazri) province, which used to be a district of Izmit, ranked second with 3,046 deaths, followed by Yalova with 2,400, Istanbul with 984, Bolu with 248, Bursa with 122, Eskisehir with 58 and Zongulbak with three, the center said.
Preliminary estimates have put direct economic loss of the quake at between 20 and 40 billion U.S. dollars, though no concrete figures could be concluded as rescue works were still going on.
The massive quake, with a magnitude of 7.4 degrees on the Richter scale, rocked heavily-populated northwest Turkish provinces near the Marmara Sea at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday.
Since then, there have been 1,300 aftershocks in the region, dozens of which registered at four degrees or above.
