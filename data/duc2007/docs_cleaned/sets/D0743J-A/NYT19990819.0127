Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997.
It might have been just a lucky guess.
Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
In the scientific article, two U.S. Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault, within the next 30 years.
Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit.
Early indications are that the epicenter was on the Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault system.
The article, published in Geophysical Research International and titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since 1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS researchers Ross S. Stein and James H. Dieterich and Aykut A. Barka of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University.
``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday.
``This earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper.''
At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned only a 12 percent probability to it.
Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes.
Since 1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists described it.
The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat, domino-style pattern of occurrence.
According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in that region.
According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967 quake.
They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan.
The Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes elsewhere.
The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said.
``The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
As a result, for most of the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise, compared with the shaky 19th century.
