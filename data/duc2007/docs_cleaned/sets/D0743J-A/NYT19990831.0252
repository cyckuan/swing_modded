strong tremor shook already devastated towns in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, bringing several buildings crashing down and causing at least one death.
It was the strongest tremor to hit the area since the shattering earthquake of Aug. 17, which killed more than 14,000 people.
Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are homeless as a result of that quake.
Tuesday's tremor, which shook the Earth back and forth for about 10 seconds, struck shortly after 11 a.m. and was followed by an aftershock about 20 minutes later.
The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the aftershock measured 4.6.
Seismologists with the U.S. Geological Survey put the strength slightly higher at 5.4 for Tuesday's initial tremor and 4.7 for the aftershock.
Here in Izmit, where many homeless families are living in tents and railway boxcars, 166 people were admitted to hospitals and clinics after being hit by debris.
30-year-old man was killed when masonry fell on him as he was fleeing a building that had been weakened in the Aug. 17 quake.
Seven buildings were reported to have collapsed.
The local governor sent aides into the streets with loudspeakers to urge residents not to panic.
In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was one of the hardest hit by the Aug. 17 quake, which had a magnitude measured at 7.4, Tuesday's tremor sent people racing away from blocks of already weakened buildings.
Many buildings shook, but none fell.
Tuesday's tremor was also felt in some parts of Istanbul, which is about 65 miles from the apparent epicenter near Izmit.
Dishes rattled in some homes, and desks shook in one of the few schools where the academic year had already begun.
But in Istanbul as in other areas, the main effect was psychological.
``Even if it doesn't do more damage, I don't like it,'' said Yusuf Ozkul, a carpenter in Golcuk who lost his home in the earlier quake and who is now living in a tent beside the Sea of Marmara.
``It makes me nervous, because I've seen what these things can do.
He chatted with several survivors living in tents.
They expressed gratitude for the American relief aid and said their greatest need now was housing.
The weather in this part of Turkey usually turns cold around mid-October.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has announced that she will visit Turkey on Sunday.
She will be in the region on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals and added Turkey to her itinerary at the last moment.
They were charged with using low-quality concrete, weak reinforcing rods and shoddy construction techniques that led to the fatal collapses of their buildings in the Aug. 17 quake.
``I've been a construction engineer for 30 years, and I've never seen reinforcing rods that are completely smooth like the ones I saw here,'' said Fred Stolaski, a relief worker from Florida.
Gucer, who spoke from an undisclosed location, built a large apartment complex in the seaside town of Yalova in which several hundred people are believed to have perished.
``There's no reason for me to have a guilty conscience,'' he was quoted as saying.
``Naturally I sympathize with the victims and their families, but I don't understand why I'm being made a scapegoat.
Naturally I didn't know much about the business.
I'm a poet, not a structural engineer.
When I asked about it, the architect told me it was completely normal.
Only later did I learn that this is a completely wrong and dangerous technique.
So I gave the order to stop doing such a disgusting thing.
Unfortunately, half the complex was already finished by then.''
