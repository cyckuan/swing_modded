The United States offered help to Turkey on Tuesday after a severe earthquake there killed hundreds of people.
President Bill Clinton said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Henry Shelton was in Ankara for military meetings, and he offered military support for recovery efforts.
"We will continue to determine what further help is needed," he said.
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Shelton, who was in Turkey when the earthquake took place last night, had offered helicopters, tents and blankets from U.S. bases there.
Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Marc Grossman said a 70-member search-and-rescue team was expected to leave for the worst-hit city, Izmit, southeast of Istanbul.
Another team of eight disaster experts was being sent to Istanbul to help the Turkish authorities coordinate rescue work, Grossman said.
The United States has military facilities in several parts of Turkey, including at the air base in Incirlik in the east of the country used for U.S. warplanes patrolling over the imposed no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
