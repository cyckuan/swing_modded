Turkey's prime minister has promised stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's massive earthquake.
The government on Tuesday said the death toll rose to 17,997, but revised that figure down to 12,514 early today.
In Cinarcik, a suburb of the resort town of Yalova, rescuers rushed to the site of a collapsed building after residents reported hearing sounds from under the crushed concrete.
Lt. Col. Numan Arslanyer, head of the crisis center in Yalova, said four brothers were believed buried in the building, and that Turkish, Bulgarian and German rescuers were working intensively to dig them out.
``We have not lost hope to find people alive, and we will not lose hope,'' he said today.
The last live rescue was Monday, when a 4-year-old boy was saved.
The 4.7-magnitude quake was centered near Haymana, 40 miles south of the capital, Ankara.
4.2-magnitude aftershock followed.
Haymana residents spent the night in parks and their cars, fearing more tremors.
Even more than a week after the quake, counting the dead was proving a difficult task.
An official at the government's crisis center in Ankara, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a mistake had been made while entering data into a computer, resulting in the erroneous report that nearly 18,000 people had died.
Two days of rain have deepened the misery of the estimated 200,000 people left homeless by the quake, many of whom have complained bitterly that the government has been slow in responding to the crisis.
Turkey's leaders defended their actions.
``Of course the people have the right to be nervous, have the right to complain, but this is a natural disaster,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday.
Many of the buildings that collapsed like houses of cards in the quake were built with concrete that had been mixed with ordinary sea sand.
Rescuers say they have even seen seashells in the crumbled concrete.
``Mistakes have been made in the past with regard to the unofficial control of constructions ... and we are determined as a government to take the necessary steps,'' said the prime minister, without elaborating.
The Anatolia news agency today quoted one major building contractor as acknowledging he used sea sand in his concrete.
He said he hadn't understood the dangers.
He said nearly one-sixth of the 3,000 apartment units he built had collapsed in the quake.
Veli spoke to Anatolia from in hiding, but told the agency he would surrender to police when passions calmed.
Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid, including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and garbage trucks.
Dutch group said it would send 30,000 prefabricated shelters designed to withstand quakes and winter cold.
The United States plans to send 3,500 all-weather tents, reports said.
International efforts to assess the damage were gathering speed, with a European Community delegation arriving today and due to visit the quake zone Thursday.
Tarja Halonen, the foreign minister of Finland, was accompanied by the EU's external relations commissioner, Hans van den Broek.
Finland holds the rotating EU presidency.
Despite rescue efforts like the one today in Cinarcik, the search for survivors was winding down.
But there was a strong reluctance to officially declare that there was no longer hope for pulling anyone from the rubble alive.
Out in hard-hit cities like Golcuk and Izmit, heavy earthmoving equipment was at work at many sites, marking an effective end to the delicate rescue efforts of previous days.
Meanwhile, relief workers were turning their attention to the quake's devastating psychological effects.
French group said it was beginning counseling for 500 children in quake-damaged Izmit, and Turkey's Psychological Association said it would send 50 therapists to the quake zone.
The association was also distributing leaflets meant to help people mentally cope with the losses they had suffered.
