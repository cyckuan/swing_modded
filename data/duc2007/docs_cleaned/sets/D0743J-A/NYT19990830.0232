On a stretch of grassy promenade in front of the Sea of Marmara, the Meckeli family has built a living room of sorts, with an overstuffed couch, matching chairs and a small coffee table holding warm cans of soda.
Their real apartment was made unlivable by the earthquake that devastated a huge part of Turkey's industrialized region.
And now, like so many others living out in the open air, the Meckelis are trying to hold on to a semblance of their old life while they wait for the government to help them build a new one.
``The important thing is that we made it out alive, but sooner or later somebody has to tell us what's going to happen to us, how long will we be out here, will we ever get any money for our losses?''
Almost two weeks after the earthquake, which killed more than 13,000 people and left at least 200,000 homeless, officials are struggling to come up with a plan to provide housing for quake survivors who often lost everything.
Japan and the Netherlands have promised prefabricated housing to ensure that the homeless get out of tent camps by the start of winter.
Other countries have donated money and supplies to help people get through the next few months.
This is a temporary measure, until the government organizes a program for rebuilding the 10,000 buildings 60,000 apartments that collapsed or that were seriously damaged in the 45-second earthquake that hit Turkey's most industrialized region.
Engineering experts warn that before construction starts, Turkey must put together stronger rules to ensure that buildings can withstand quakes in this temblor-prone region.
Many engineers say that lax building codes, and unscrupulous contractors and politicians, contributed to the disaster by allowing substandard buildings on fault lines.
``We've learned a lesson from this earthquake about how things should be built, and now the issue is that we want to ensure that standards are met and that the government institutes necessary laws for this,'' said Murat Celik, chairman of the Modern Lawyer's Association.
The association is one of several groups trying to sue the government from Turkey's president to Istanbul officials for not ensuring that buildings were constructed according to earthquake standards.
The lawsuits also might help survivors to get compensation.
Because home insurance is rare, and contractors are not required to carry insurance, few of those who lost their homes can count on being recompensed for their losses.
Estimated costs to Turkey from the earthquake range from $4.5 billion, for the loss in production, to about $17 billion for the added damage to apartment buildings and the infrastructure.
This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross domestic product loss, or ``negative growth.''
But business groups say the economy should start bouncing back by the year 2001, partly because of the construction boom that the earthquake has necessitated.
``Of course the human tragedy is foremost in people's mind,'' said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of TUSIAD, the country's main industrialists' association.
``But we would expect a great deal of economic activity over the next two to four years because of the reconstruction,'' Yucaoglu said.
Turkey is also expecting loans and grants to help it shoulder the burden of rehousing people and restoring damaged infrastructure.
Water lines are still down in most of the quake-hit region, electricity is just being turned back on, and roads and bridges need repair.
One issue is how many of the damaged buildings some of which were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.
``We can put a man on the moon but at what cost?''
``From an engineering standpoint it's easier to knock down a building and start again than try and reinforce, but it's tough to tell people that you're going to wipe out their structure where all their savings went,'' he said.
But some groups are not waiting for help from the government, which was accused by many of being slow to react after the earthquake.
Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.
This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.
At the Pakmaya yeast factory in Izmit, a private company that exports to 100 countries, officials said they were preparing to break ground to build 80 housing units for workers who lost their homes.
``The employees contributed to our earnings over the years, and now it's our turn to share these gains with our workers,'' said Tuncay Yurdesin, factory manager.
