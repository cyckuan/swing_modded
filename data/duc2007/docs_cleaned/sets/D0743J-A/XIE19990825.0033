The death toll in the monster earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting.
In the face of threats ranging from a typhoid epidemic to lack of shelters under heavy rains, the survivors are seized with depression, especially while seeing bulldozers ripping into the heaps of rubble which have become the graves of their loved ones.
As the estimated 200,000 survivors have turned into refugees, Turkish officials broadcast appeals on Tuesday for everything from tents to bulldozers to help begin rebuilding living shattered by the earthquake.
However, more immediate medical worries began to emerge as the death toll reached some 18,000.
The Prime Ministry Crisis Administration Center stated Tuesday that the regional coordination center established in Izmit, epicenter of the devastating earthquake, will start operations later Tuesday.
Meanwhile, education and entertainment facilities in the affected regions, and in neighboring provinces, were evacuated and prepared for the earthquake victims.
The government has decided to urgently purchase 150 ambulances and all necessary measures have been taken to prevent any kind of failure in telephone lines, especially when Turkey is facing bad weather conditions.
Heavy rains lashed the quake-stricken regions for a second day.
The muddy quagmires left by the downpours increased fears of disease from mosquitoes and flies attracted by the foul-smelling pools.
Thousands of decaying bodies are believed to be still buried under the rubble.
The Turkish military decided to cancel the four-day Victory Day celebrations set to begin on Thursday, marking the Turkish expulsion of other forces in 1922.
