At least seven people died Monday and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.
The tremor, which came in mid-afternoon, was felt in Turkey's three biggest cities Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir which are separated by hundreds of miles.
An Istanbul observatory reported that the quake registered 5.8 on the Richter scale (last month's quake registered 7.4).
It caused dozens of buildings to collapse and sent thousands of people racing from their homes.
At least 239 were injured, many suffering broken bones after jumping from their windows.
``These aftershocks have created panic,'' said President Suleyman Demirel.
Turkish television stations showed ambulances racing through the streets of Izmit and Adapazari, towns near the reported epicenter of the tremor.
Other scenes showed people running through the streets of Golcuk.
Buildings were reported to have collapsed in all three cities, which were devastated by the Aug. 17 quake.
Hundreds of people gathered in streets and in parks, unwilling to return to their homes.
Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the affected areas closed until further notice.
Some parents said they would keep children at home indefinitely.
Ecevit also sent a team of government officials to survey the damage by helicopter.
Many Turks had criticized him for not responding quickly when the big quake struck last month.
Traders at the Istanbul stock exchange also felt the tremor.
Stock prices quickly began to fall, and after the index had dropped more than 2 percent, trading was suspended.
Domestic and international telephone service was disrupted in much of the region, making an accurate assessment of damage difficult.
Three of those killed Monday were driving a car through Golcuk when a building fell onto their vehicle.
Three others were crushed by debris near Izmit, and a woman died of a heart attack as she rushed from her home in Adapazari.
The willingness of people to run and jump from buildings at the first sign of a tremor reflected the new sense of vulnerability that many Turks feel.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since the Aug. 17 earthquake, and seismologists say some can be classified as quakes in their own right.
Seismologists have warned that aftershocks and tremors may shake Turkey for months and possibly years.
Most say there is little chance of another major disaster anytime soon, but many Turks, especially those in the devastated areas, have seen the damage a quake can do and are evidently unwilling to take chances.
``These aftershocks may continue, and I hope they will not be as violent as the one today,'' Ecevit said.
``We will have to learn to live with them.''
It said the economic cost may exceed $15 billion.
``The increased uncertainty will negatively affect all economic activity in Turkey,'' the report said.
``The damage necessitates the influx of vast sums of funds to restore normal life in the region.''
Last week a quake struck neighboring Greece, killing more than 100 people.
These seismic movements have given Greeks and Turks a sense of shared destiny that is having important political implications as the countries' governments move closer together.
Seismic movements in Turkey over recent weeks, and the government's widely perceived failure to respond to them, continue to shake the political landscape here.
``Leaders of the state should come here and see what it's like,'' one women in the zone that was shaken Monday told a television interviewer.
``No one can live here any more.''
