More than a week after the August 17 killer earthquake in northwestern Turkey, people with quake-related injuries were still flooding to hospitals.
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related diseases surpassed 4,100.
Quake survivors with injured heads, broken arms and legs overflew the 120 private and 38 state hospitals in the metropolis.
Nearly half of the patients in Istanbul's hospitals are suffering from bone fractures.
Some of them were sent here by ambulances or helicopters from other quake-hit areas where public hospitals were demolished and the makeshift field hospitals, set up by medical staff from internal or foreign countries, did not have necessary facilities to deal with some serious injuries.
In a number of state hospitals, the personnel had to go without sleep for 40 hours or more.
Thousands of people were treated for minor injuries and then discharged.
Some of the survivors, who had been buried under rubble for days and were rescued recently, had developed kidney problems due to lack of water.
Medical conditions were tougher in other quake-stricken areas.
In Adapazari, about 130 kilometers east of Istanbul, several field hospitals were operating along with a public hospital which was half-ruined in the quake but returned to partial functioning lately.
In a field hospital by a busy intersection, a woman doctor said she and her colleges, all volunteer medical personnel from surrounding areas like Istanbul, Izmit, Bolu or Yalova, were working here in clinic tents in groups of three persons.
They would be working for three-four days non-stop before being replaced.
Due to limitations of medical facilities, some patients were transferred to the nearby Israeli military field hospital which was better equipped.
Those patients who were beyond the treatment were sent to Istanbul or the Turkish capital of Ankara.
Another doctor said he and his two colleges in a tent had received over 70 patients since eight o'clock in the morning through afternoon.
