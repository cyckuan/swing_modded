The earthquake that struck western Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a leading geologist said Sunday.
Prof. Aykut Barka of Istanbul Technical University said the tremors were 20 seconds apart, and their epicenter was near the northwestern town of Izmit, 90 miles east of Istanbul.
Together, the two quakes lasted about 45 seconds at 3 a.m. Tuesday, Barka told the private NTV television station.
The death toll in the 7.4-magnitude quake has surpassed 12,000 and some officials have predicted as many as 40,000 could have died.
Several U.S. and European seismologists have arrived in Turkey to study the quake.
Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said it is common for large earthquakes to occur in multiple surges in rapid succession.
``Almost every earthquake bigger than a 6-point magnitude is a multiple event,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to break a chunk of rock that long in one instance.''
Only in the last 20 years has technology allowed scientists to detect multiple events in a major quake, he said.
