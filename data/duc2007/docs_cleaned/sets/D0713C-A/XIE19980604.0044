Russia does not see India and Pakistan as nuclear club members though they conducted a series of nuclear tests, Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Wednesday.
The Interfax news agency quoted the Ministry's spokesman Valery Nesterushkin as saying that "Despite the series of nuclear tests conducted by India and pakistan, Russia views them as states that do not possess nuclear weapons."
The spokesman said, "It is precisely in this capacity that we urge these countries to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
In accordance with the treaty, a country is considered a nuclear state if it had produced and tested a nuclear weapon or another nuclear device by January 1, 1967, Nesterushkin said.
Meanwhile, in experts' opinion, neither Pakistan nor India has done everything necessary to convert nuclear devices to warheads and place them on delivery vehicles.
On the meeting of foreign ministers of the five nuclear powers (Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and China) in Geneva on Thursday, the spokesman said, "the basic goal of the meeting is to coordinate positions and find approaches that would conduce Delhi and Islamabad to stop further development of their nuclear programs and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
