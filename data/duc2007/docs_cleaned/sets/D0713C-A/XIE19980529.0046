In reaction to Pakistan's nuclear tests, Egypt Thursday underscored the need to make the Middle East a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Meanwhile, Israel said it would be more dangerous if Iran has nuclear weapons.
"If this kind of weapons get into hands of regimes like Iran, the danger of distablization will be ever greater," Israel Radio quoted David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as making a brief reaction to the nuclear tests.
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices Thursday, which is widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests two weeks ago.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said "This (nuclear test) places the region of South Asia in a special position in view of the presence of two nuclear powers in it."
He said Israel, believed to be the only Mideast country with nuclear capabilities, should join the NPT and otherwise the treaty will become insignificant for the Middle East states.
"Rendering the Middle East a region free from nuclear weapons is now a must for maintaining regional security," he said, stressing that all the states in the region should abide by the treaty.
