Saudi Arabia on Monday renewed its support to efforts in eliminating weapons of mass destruction, especially in the Middle East region, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
Riyadh is "looking forward to seeing the Middle East region free of all kinds of mass destruction weapons," said Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a weekly cabinet session he chaired in the country's western city of Jeddah.
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear facilities to international inspection.
Abdullah's remarks came after Saudi Second Prime Minister and Defense and Aviation Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz denied any Saudi attempts to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan or any other country.
In response to a question over his visit to a uranium enrichment plant and a missile factory in Pakistan, Sultan said it did not "exceed the entrances of the sites and did not include secret facilities as reported."
Earlier reports said that British officials were worried that Riyadh might have sought to buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan.
