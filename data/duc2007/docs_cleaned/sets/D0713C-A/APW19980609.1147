Describing the NPT as discriminatory, Sharif, in an interview to Emirates News, said some nuclear weapon states have sought to justify their retention of nuclear weapons on the basis of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, when none of them is threatened, directly or indirectly, in the post cold-war era.
Sharif's comments came a day after the security council condemned the nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan last month asking them to stop testing and sign NPT and CTBT.
Sharif, who is presently in the UAE, also said despite confessing commitment to non-proliferation, the major powers have failed to honour these obligations under the NPT.
Sharif reiterated his offer for the resumption of dialogue process with India and said it is upto India...to agree to a serious, substantive and meaningful dialogue on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, in accordance with the UN resolutions.
When asked about the possible agenda for such a dialogue, he said agenda has already been finalised while referring to an agreement between India and Pakistan in June last year when eight outstanding issues had been identified.
Adds: Pakistan yesterday rejected the United Nations call to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), saying the security council approach had been ``unjust and unrealistic.''
It also regretted that the security council failed to deal ``adequately'' with its dispute with India over Kashmir which has endangered peace and security in the region.
'The council has ignored the reality on the ground'' a foreign office spokesman here said, after an overnight UN resolution urged India and Pakistan to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as non-nuclear states.
'Treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties,'' the spokesman said in a statement, adding that treaty provisions could only be assumed only on a ``voluntary basis.''
'Any attempts at imposition of treaty obligations is by its very nature unequal and unsustainable,'' he added.
Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices last month ``to correct strategic imbalance'' triggered by five underground nuclear tests by its rival India on May 11 and 13.
Pakistan said the explosions were imperative to ensure its security which had been threatened by the Indian action.
The two south Asian neighbours, who have squared off in three wars since independence 50 years ago, with two of them fought over the festering Kashmir problem, earlier refused to join the NPT.
The foreign office spokesman also 'regretted'' that the council resolution did not deal ``adequately and effectively with the urgent and core issues that have endangered peace and security in South Asia.''
