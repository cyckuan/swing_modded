Members of the Organization of American States (OAS) Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to conduct no more nuclear tests similar to those they carried out last month.
In a resolution passed at the 28th OAS annual meeting, foreign ministers or their representatives from the 34 member states unanimously condemned the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan last month.
The resolution said that the tests not only violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but also threatened peace and stability in South Asia.
It urged India and Pakistan to sign immediately and unconditionally the NPT and seek peaceful means to settle their differences.
The resolution called for utmost restraint and renouncement of any new nuclear testing plan on the part of the South Asian countries in question.
It also stressed the importance for all countries in the world to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as the two pacts are basic factors in preventing nuclear proliferation and promoting nuclear disarmament.
