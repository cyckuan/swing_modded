More countries have come out to condemn Pakistan's nuclear tests.
The French Foreign Ministry issued a communique Thursday to deplore and condemn the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan on the same day.
France calls on both India and Pakistan not to conduct any more nuclear tests but to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and join talks on the banning of production of fissile materials that can be used to produce nuclear arms, said the communique.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday, "We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
He also announced a series of sanctions against Pakistan, which he said are consistent with those imposed on India after its nuclear tests.
