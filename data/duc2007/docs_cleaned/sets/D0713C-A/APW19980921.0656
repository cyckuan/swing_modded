India and Pakistan joined the ranks Monday of traditional targets Iraq and North Korea for flaunting nuclear weapons conventions, as the U.N. atomic agency opened its annual conference.
This spring, India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests that drew international condemnation.
``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
India claimed to have detonated five nuclear devices in May, and Pakistan said it had detonated six devices in response.
The tests triggered fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
Several governments, including the United States, Japan and the European Union, urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
As in previous years, Iraq and North Korea also drew criticism for their nuclear policies at the start of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's weeklong meeting.
Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, said his agency's inspection and verification operations have given it insight into Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programs, but ``a degree of uncertainty remains as to the completeness of this picture.''
In August, Iraq limited IAEA access to declared nuclear sites, preventing the agency from inspecting new sites or investigating the lingering questions about the country's program, ElBaradei said.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a press conference ``Iraq is still in substantial violation of numerous (U.N.) Security Council resolutions.
``The United States, for one, is keeping all options on the table to ensure that Iraq complies,'' with the resolutions, Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, added.
North Korea also was criticized by ElBaradei for failing to cooperate with the IAEA.
In particular, North Korea has not preserved material the IAEA needs to verify the accuracy of information the country has provided on its nuclear program.
