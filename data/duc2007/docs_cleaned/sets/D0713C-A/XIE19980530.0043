Turkey and Iran have expressed concern over the underground nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan to match India's five explosions two week ago.
The statement said that the two neighboring countries should refrain from a reciprocal show of power and should solve their disputes peacefully.
"Turkey wishes that this alarming development recorded in the recent weeks will not pave the way for a new nuclear arms race," it added.
Pakistan detonated five underground nuclear devices Thursday, widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them discriminatory.
Iran has called on Pakistan and India to cease nuclear tests and rivalry and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on Thursday that Iran follows with deep concern the ongoing chain of events concerning nuclear tests, the official news agency IRNA said in a delayed report on Friday.
Mohammadi said that the current nuclear race poses a serious threat and danger to regional peace and stability, a race which is first and foremost the consequence of lack of political will on the part of the nuclear powers to heed the call of international community for a comprehensive nuclear disarmament.
The spokesman warned that in the absence of an all-encompassing program for comprehensive nuclear disarmament, the status and future of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would face great uncertainty.
