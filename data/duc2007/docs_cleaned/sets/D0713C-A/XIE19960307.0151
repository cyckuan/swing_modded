"Pakistan has nuclear capability, but has decided at the highest level not to use it for non-peaceful purposes," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this afternoon, he strongly refuted the report that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear test.
The Washington Post daily quoted some US officials as saying Wednesday that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province.
"The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its security," said the spokesman.
The statement described the Washington Post's story as "speculative and based on faulty leaked intelligence reports."
"Pakistan has been in the vanguard locally and regionally to advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation," said the spokesman.
"Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have fumbled because of India's negativism," he added.
The US government has also criticized India recently for preparing for its second nuclear test.
