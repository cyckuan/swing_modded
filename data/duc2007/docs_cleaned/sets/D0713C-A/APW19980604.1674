The five longstanding nuclear states refused Thursday to admit India or Pakistan into the nuclear club and called on them to refrain from further nuclear tests and resolve their differences with direct talks.
Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, at an emergency meeting to deal with the South Asian arms race, also promised to assist in cooling tension between India and Pakistan and called upon them to ``avoid threatening military movements, cross-border violations or other provocative acts.''
``We are prepared to help India and pakistan maintain peace if they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
``It is a strong message from the permanent members of the Security Council and they'd better stop, look, and listen,'' she said.
``The ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep concern about the danger to peace and stability in the region, and pledged to cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear and missile arms race in the subcontinent,'' the powers stated in a joint communique.
In rejecting the South Asian nations' bid to join the ranks of nuclear powers, the five nations said after a two-hour meeting: ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.''
India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them, the communique said.
The leaders underscored the urgency of India and Pakistan rejoining the global arms-control movement they sent staggering last month when India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests.
Specifically, they urged both nations to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty unconditionally meaning without any ``rewards'' such as permanent status on the U.N. Security Council or any changes in the obligations the treaty imposes on nuclear powers.
Conspicuously missing from the communique was any mention of either sanctions or incentives designed to persuade India and Pakistan to step back from their nuclear standoff.
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the communique from the major nuclear powers would not instantly change the behavior of India or Pakistan.
He quoted a Chinese proverb: ``It is up to the one who tied the knot to untie it.''
Tang opened the meeting by saying the nations are united in calling on India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear testing and pull back from an incipient arms race.
``Tension in the region is mounting,'' Tang said.
``The permanent members of the (U.N.) Security Council bear important responsibility toward world peace and stability.''
He said the purpose of the meeting was ``to channel our joint efforts to arrest the nuclear arms race in South Asia.''
Albright, who called the meeting at U.N. offices here, met separately with Tang and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov before diplomats from the five powers convened to approve the joint communique on the India-Pakistan crisis.
Tang hinted at the Chinese inclination toward Pakistan in his description of the events of the past month.
``In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went ahead with its nuclear tests,'' Tang said.
``After the peace and stability in the South Asian region had been undermined, Pakistan also carried out nuclear tests.''
Despite differing perspectives, the five nations adopted a united stance.
