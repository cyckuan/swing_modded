Saudi Arabia called on India and Pakistan to show great self-restraint, saying that nuclear tests conducted by both countries do not serve security and stability in the region, Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Al-Faresi was quoted as saying that his country understood the viewpoint of Pakistani government as to safeguarding its security, but "we still calls on both Pakistan and India to practice self-restraint and resume negotiations to ensure security and stability in South Asia."
Al-Faresi made the remarks in a statement after the weekly cabinet meeting.
He also said his country hopes the international community to avoid double-standard policy which turns a blind eye to Israel's nuclear facilities.
Saudi Arabia supports a full ban of nuclear proliferation and seeks to make the Middle East a region free of mass-destruction weapons, he said.
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week.
Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that Tehran is against any nuclear test intended for weapon purposes, but favors civilian use of nuclear energy.
With Russian assistance, Iran is building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south.
This has raised doubt that Tehran may be seeking access to nuclear weapons.
"Iran wants the Middle East and the Persian Gulf to be free from non-conventional weapons," Shamkhani said.
He said Iran supports compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty, but holds that elimination of non-conventional weapons and disarmament of Israel are prerequisites for banning proliferation of nuclear arms.
