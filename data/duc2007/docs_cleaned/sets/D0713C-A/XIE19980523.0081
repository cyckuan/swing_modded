Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made it clear on Saturday that his country will not give up its nuclear option despite the mounting pressure from some big powers in this regard in the wake of India's nuclear tests.
"We are not seeking any bargains," Sharif said in a written statement issued at a press conference here.
It is the first press conference given by the prime minister since India conducted a series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
"Overt Indian nuclear weaponization has seriously upset the strategic balance in the region and emboldened India to make a naked assertion of her hostile intentions towards Pakistan," the prime minister noted.
"Can the Pakistani nation afford to barter its independence, security and sovereignty?
What is the price for liberty and freedom, dignity and honor?"
"The talk of sanctions is not only familiar to us but it also does not rattle us.
We have learnt to live with these punitive measures," he said.
"Our legitimate need for security is still being ignored," he said, regretting that discriminatory policies were pursued by the Western world on the nuclear issue towards Pakistan.
"Indian defiance (in nuclear tests) on the other hand has even now attracted some sanctions but more understanding.
Some have even offered endorsement," he said.
"No amount of condemnation or sanctions have changed the immediacy or magnitude of the threat to us.
Practically sanctions mean little and change nothing," he said.
"We believe that the Indian actions have rendered the non-proliferation regime and instruments such as Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty irrelevant," he said.
"What did we earn in exchange of the restraint?
Discriminatory and punitive measures were imposed on us.
In a manifestly unjust and unfair approach Pakistan was penalized for every Indian escalatory step on the nuclear and ballistic ladder," he said.
"The Indian record of aggression and irresponsible behavior is a stark reality for Pakistan.
Our compulsions are not hidden.
The balance of power in the region has been violently tilted," Sharif said.
"Under these circumstances our undivided focus must be on the preservation of our national security interests," he said.
