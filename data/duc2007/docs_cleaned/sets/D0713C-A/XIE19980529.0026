Some countries or international organizations expressed concerns after Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices on Thursday in response to the nuclear tests carried out by India on May 11 and 13.
The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday he deplores both the Indian and the Pakistani nuclear tests.
"They (India and Pakistan) exacerbate tension in an already difficult relations," he said in a statement.
Annan's statement came after Pakistan announced it has conducted five nuclear explosions at 3:30 pm.
Annan called on both Indian and Pakistani governments to freeze their nuclear weapons development programs and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a no-first-use pledge with each other.
In Luxembourg, Javier Solana, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), said the alliance would urge India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint and to respect the international non-proliferation norms and the CTBT.
Solana said the NATO does not consider sanctions against the nuclear testers.
The NATO chief said the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan would not "dramatically" affect the thinking of the new strategic concept of the alliance.
The United States President Bill Clinton announced in a televised statement Thursday that the United States would impose sanctions on Pakistan as it did on India.
Clinton expressed the fear that Pakistan's nuclear tests might lead to escalation of tension in South Asia.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called on Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the CTBT.
He also urged the two arch-rivals to renew regional dialogue and work towards a peaceful resolution of differences.
Chretien announced his country's relations with Pakistan would now be placed on hold and that further measures would be announced in light of the development in both India and Pakistan.
