India's prime minister said Friday he looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart later this month to discuss the issues over which they fought two wars and launched a nuclear arms race.
``India and Pakistan have to live together.
We can't change the geography and will have to live like good neighbors,'' United News of India news agency quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as telling Parliament.
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a seven-nation regional group.
Vajpayee said India is prepared for talks with Pakistan without the involvement of any other nation in resolving their disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the Himalayan state of Kashmir.
He repeated his call on Pakistan to enter into a no-first-use nuclear weapons agreement with India.
Vajpayee also said India wants to resolve a border dispute with China that has chilled relations between both nations.
India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May, saying it needed a nuclear deterrent due to threats from China and Pakistan.
Pakistan responded with its own tests.
Following the tests, the United States, Britain, Japan and other industrialized nations imposed economic and military sanctions on both India and Pakistan.
They also urged both of them to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which they have refused to do for years.
India says the treaties are flawed because they allow nations with sophisticated nuclear weapons to keep their arsenals.
On Friday, Vajpayee said India is prepared to discuss the test ban treaty.
``However, nobody should feel that we are ready to participate because we are weak,'' he said.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to exempt agriculture credits from nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and India.
The move will help U.S. farmers who are desperate for markets sell wheat and other products in South Asia.
