Trims.
An international meeting Thursday on India's nuclear rivalry with neighboring Pakistan likely means that the world's five original nuclear powers will address the main dispute between the two countries: Kashmir.
The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race.
India and Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of Economics' Asia Research Center.
One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both countries claim.
``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain said.
Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists it remain a bilateral issue.
Now, Hussain said, India fears the Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, rejected the possibility of international mediation.
Vajpayee repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
On Thursday, Vajpayee told Parliament that India would welcome any international initiative on global disarmament, but said focusing on South Asia alone was unfair.
Vajpayee also said India and Pakistan were under ``unwarranted'' pressure to sign a global test ban treaty.
India has long spurned both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to give up their nuclear arsenals.
The five foreign secretaries, meeting in Geneva as the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, were expected to call on India to sign the NPT and the CTBT.
Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory shut down shops and cleared streets of traffic with a general strike in the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state Thursday, saying they believe the world was now paying attention to their protests.
``Unless the issue (of Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of the people under international principles, peace will not return to the Indian subcontinent,'' said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All Parties Hurriet Conference called the strike in Srinagar city.
The conference is a coalition of parties who want Indian-held Kashmir to break away either to form an independent country or join Pakistan.
India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only moral support.
