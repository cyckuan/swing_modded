Japan Tuesday urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before India, saying it would boost the image of Pakistan in the international community.
"We urged Pakistan to ensure progress in the nuclear field and ink the CTBT before India," a senior Japanese official said after talks held here between officials from the two countries.
"Tokyo will appreciate Pakistan if it takes the initiative to show adherence to the non-proliferation treaty," Director in the Japanese Foreign Ministry Kazauya Ogawa said.
He said the Japanese delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Minoru Tamba, stressed the need for legislation to tighten control over the export of nuclear technology to third country.
"We conveyed our concern over the cooperation between Pakistan and North Korea in the nuclear field and told the Pakistani side that it would affect ties between Pakistan and Japan," Ogawa said.
However, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, who led the Pakistani side at the talks, rejected reports that Islamabad is receiving any assistance from third country in the nuclear field.
"We also asked Pakistan to refrain from further test of missile and stop the production of fissile materials," Ogawa said.
Pakistani officials, he said, told the Japanese side that Pakistan is participating in the talks on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) in Geneva.
Japan agreed that Kashmir is the root cause of tension in South Asia and hoped the tension would reduce through bilateral talks between Pakistan and India, said Ogawa.
Japan is ready to facilitate Pakistan and India to hold talks in Tokyo if the two countries agree, he said.
Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Japan, the largest donor to Pakistan, slapped economic sanctions after the country's nuclear tests last May.
Japan had extended 500 million U.S. dollars to Pakistan annually.
Pakistan has been for several months under tremendous pressure by the Western countries to ink the CTBT before the sanctions are lifted.
The main purpose of the Japanese deputy foreign minister's visit is to convince Pakistan to sign the CTBT.
In the wake of nuclear tests last May, the Japanese government stopped granting aids and loans to Pakistan and decided not to support Pakistan in getting loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank.
During Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's visit to Japan late last year, the Japanese government removed its opposition to Pakistan's getting loans from international institutions, but refused to lift sanctions before Pakistan signs the CTBT.
