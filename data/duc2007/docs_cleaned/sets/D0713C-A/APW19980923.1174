``Pakistan is ... prepared to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before this conference,'' Sharif told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly session.
``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily removed,'' Sharif said.
``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan will be lifted,'' he said.
But Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on nuclear tests only so long as India did the same.
``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review its position,'' Sharif said.
Both India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last May, drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban treaty.
