Russia on Thursday repeated its call to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry said "Russia insists on immediate and unconditional accession" of India and Pakistan to the treaty, and the revision of their nuclear policies.
Nearly 190 countries have joined the treaty, which took effect in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995, he said.
Russia wanted the pact to be universal.
In a move that sparked global shock and concern, India launched underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and triggered Pakistan to follow suit late that month, despite the risk of bringing about a nuclear arms race in the region.
Despite opposition to the nuclear tests, Russia did not favor sanctions against India and wanted to carry out military cooperation with India if it respected Moscow's line on nuclear disarmament.
"Russia has developed and will continue to develop its military cooperation with India within the framework of international norms and national legislation," Rakhmanin said.
"However, Moscow would obviously watch Delhi's response to Russia's line towards nuclear disarmament," he said.
But Alexei Yablokov, a well known Russian environmental expert, told Interfax the NPT was, in effect, violated by Russia's plan to supply India with nuclear technology.
Russia and India, on June 21, signed a deal supplementing the Soviet-Indian agreement of 1988 on cooperation in construction of a nuclear power station in Kudankulam, said Yablokov.
