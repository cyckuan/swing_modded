Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday described China's stance on the nuclear issue as "mature and highly responsible."
He said it was "in sharp contrast to the irresponsible stance of India."
"As you know, China is the only nuclear weapon state which has repeatedly and authoritatively stated that it will never under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons," Shamshad told reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport after concluding a two-day visit to Beijing.
"This mature and highly responsible approach to issues of international peace and security by China stands in sharp contrast to the irresponsible statements emanating from the Indian leadership, threatening the use of nuclear weapons," he said.
He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China, invented by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic designs and aggressive agenda in South Asia," he said.
"The Chinese government has already condemned in the strongest terms the outrageous actions of the Indian government to introduce nuclear weapons in South Asia which has destabilized the strategic balance in our region."
"Our consultations with China are indeed an important facet of our wider consultations with all major powers as well as friendly countries to seek ways and means to effectively defuse tension and reduce the factors that have threatened peace and stability in our region," he said.
