Pakistan's scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said here Monday that no clause of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will affect Pakistan's nuclear capability.
In a briefing for the members of the two houses of Parliament, the two renowned scientists said there is no need to further nuclear tests at present as Pakistan has achieved its objectives from the tests conducted on May 28 and 30.
"The CTBT cannot take away anything of us that we have achieved as a result of nuclear blasts.
He, however, said there would be no cut in the present stock material.
Qadeer said Pakistan maintained its nuclear capability for a long time without conducting test.
"We conducted nuclear tests on May 28 and 30 to convey the message to the world that Pakistan has become a nuclear power," he said.
Asked as to whether Pakistan would open its nuclear installations for inspection after signing the CTBT, Qadeer said, "there is no clause in the Treaty which allows inspection.
The Treaty only bars new tests."
He also said that Pakistan has already announced moratorium on nuclear tests.
