Greek Cypriot police arrested two Israeli men Saturday on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them detained pending investigation.
The two countries have a military alliance.
Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was also quoted by Cyprus state radio as saying that it should not be assumed they were spying for Israel.
This was seen as an inference that spying, if any, might be for Turkey, which has occupied the northern third of the island of Cyprus since a 1974 invasion in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was a listening post for the intelligence agents of Israel as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was based in Lebanon, a half-hour flight from the Mediterranean island.
The suspects appeared in Larnaca District Court hours after police raided and searched their apartment in the village of Ziyi shortly after midnight.
Ziyi is near an army camp and the southern coastal town of Larnaca.

Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the district, told the court that an investigation is being conducted of whether the two spied on the Cypriot army.
Kyriacou said the pair arrived in Cyprus on Friday.
They also visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22, when the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby.
The two men were under surveillance, he said.
The men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary, 49.
They will appear in court again on Nov. 16 when formal charges could be filed or the prosecution might ask for further remand.
The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island.
The visit, the first by an Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the lukewarm relations between the two countries.
