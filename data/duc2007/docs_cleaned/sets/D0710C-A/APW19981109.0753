Israel on Monday tried to repair any damage done to relations with Cyprus after the weekend arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying for the Greek Cypriot government's enemy, Turkey.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus three days before the Israelis' arrest Saturday, sent his Cypriot counterpart a ``message of friendship,'' Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told reporters.
``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said The Justice Ministry said Sunday evening that the men have not been linked to Israel's government, but an investigation continues.
Police officials have said privately that the Israelis probably were gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the Mediterranean island.
Israel has not denied the men worked for its Mossad intelligence agency.
Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``Every Israeli citizen is important to us.
We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home.''
The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and Limassol.
They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight days for a police investigation.
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
