senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus the third botched spy mission in a year.
The Mossad operations chief, known publicly only as ``Y,'' offered to step down after Cypriot police arrested the two Israelis and seized electronic monitoring equipment, the daily Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy accepted ``Y's'' resignation, the paper said.
An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report.
The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment.
The suspects were caught with tapes of police conversations and surveillance devices near an army base on the Mediterranean island earlier this month.
Cyprus has accused them of operating with ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
Police on the island said the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, which has a defense pact with Israel.
The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned in February following a failed attempt to assassinate a leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas in Jordan.
Haaretz said ``Y'' was not involved in that operation.
