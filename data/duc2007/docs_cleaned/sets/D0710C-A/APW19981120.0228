Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
Haaretz, citing a Cypriot source, said the two Israelis now in police custody in Nicosia were under surveillance during a previous visit to Cyprus in mid-October, but were allowed to leave because of a lack of incriminating evidence.
On their next trip in early November, Cyprus monitored the two Israelis as soon as they arrived at Larnaca airport on forged passports, the paper said.
The surveillance led to their Nov. 6 arrest in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in their rented apartment.
Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv'' shortly before the arrest, Haaretz said.
Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi.
There was no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked independently of the government.
Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men in custody are Mossad agents.
Israel's Foreign Ministry has said only that reports that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey were not true.
The source cited by Haaretz said that the two men refuse to cooperate with interrogators.
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
