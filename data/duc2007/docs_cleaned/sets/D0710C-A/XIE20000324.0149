Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides will start a four-day state visit to Israel next Tuesday, local reports said Friday.
The coming visit, the first ever to Israel by a Cyprus head of state, is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip to Cyprus in November 1998.
During his stay, Clerides will hold talks with Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
Political observers here believed that the visit is a bridge- building act aimed to cement the Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by an espionage scandal.
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit to the island country in 1998.
They were caught spying on a secret military shipment near Larnaca, Cyprus' southern coast and were sentenced to three years in prison for trespassing on a prohibited military area in February last year.
The two were released six months later.
Clerides will also visit the West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
