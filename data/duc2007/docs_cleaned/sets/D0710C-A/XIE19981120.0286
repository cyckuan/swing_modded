Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
Netanyahu made the admission during his meeting with Cypriot Ambassador to Israel Euripedes Evriviades on Wednesday, CNA quoted well-informed sources as saying.
However, Netanyahu said that the two were not acting against Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.
Netanyahu also said he was sorry that his words to the press last week were misunderstood in Cyprus.
Last week, local media slammed Netanyahu's statement that he would bring back the two Israelis.
The two Israelis, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, were arrested here on November 7 after police raided their apartment and found hi-tech equipment tuned into the police radio frequency.
They were allegedly operating in a sensitive military area at a time of increased military activities in the vicinity.
Larnaca District Court issued a remand order to the two suspects on November 7 for eight-day pending investigations.
The two Israelis will appear again before the court Friday morning after they were remanded for another five days.
Thursday also quoted Moshe Fogel, director of the Israeli government press office, as saying that "the prime minister said he would try to resolve the problem."
There is ongoing contacts between the two countries, said the director, refusing to comment any further on the matter.
