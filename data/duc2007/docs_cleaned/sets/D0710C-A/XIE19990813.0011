Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday expressed his appreciation on Cyprus for its pardoning of two Israelis who had been given jail terms on spy charges.
In a statement issued by Barak's office, the prime minister said that the act, carried out by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides at the recommendation of the Cypriot general prosecutor, is greatly appreciated by the Israeli public.
Barak said that the act will promote the good neighborly relations between the two countries.
The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region.
They had pleaded guilty to a charge of approaching the prohibited military area and were sentenced to three years in prison.
They were also given a concurrent jail term of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
Israel has admitted the two were agents from its Mossad intelligence agency.
Their pardons approved by Clerides were "based on the national interest of Cyprus.
The continuing detention of the two men would no longer serve the national interest," a statement issued by Cypriot government said.
The Cypriot government also called it a friendly gesture to Israeli Barak assuming office last month.
