half the maximum allowed under Cypriot law.
The case has strained relations with Israel, whose growing military cooperation with Turkey has become a source of serious concern to Cyprus, more than one-third of which is occupied by Turkish troops.
The Israelis, arrested Nov. 6 at a fishing village on the southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a prohibited military area.
Today, they also received concurrent jail terms of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
Last Friday, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary pleaded guilty to the lesser charges after the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy and espionage in an apparent plea bargain deal.
Conspiracy and espionage carried maximum 10-year jail penalties.
The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps of the island.
The village is near military installations, including an army commando training camp.
Newspapers reported that the Israelis had made calls to a number in Tel Aviv that was believed to be Israel's Mossad spy agency.
The three-year sentence was half the maximum allowed under Cypriot law.
George Aresti, head of the three-member judicial panel of the Larnaca Assize Court, said that although the spying charge had been withdrawn, the court could not ignore that the two approached the military area ``at a time when a very serious military operation was under way.''
There were reports at the time that the operation involved the delivery of tanks and other military equipment for the Cypriot army.
Turkey has maintained troops in northern Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded in support of Turkish Cypriots after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots who sought union with Greece.
The defense had claimed that the Israelis were here in connection with an Israeli anti-terrorist operation that was not aimed at Cyprus.
But the court said no evidence was produced to back up the claim.
After reducing the charges last week, Attorney-General Alecos Markides told a news conference that Cyprus had not been pressured to drop the spying and conspiracy charges.
Markides acknowledged, however, that his Israeli counterpart, Elyakim Rubinstein, had come to see him twice about the case.
The trial began Jan. 20.
