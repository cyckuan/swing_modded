Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
The court ordered the two held for another five days after the prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete investigating ``a very serious case of spying.''
He added that investigations have already established that shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov. 6 the two men had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port of Ziyi.
Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents.
Israel's Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true.
Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance Nov. 6 a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports of suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area.''
``On the night of their arrest there was a very important military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he added.
Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the island, are interested in gaining information on the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
