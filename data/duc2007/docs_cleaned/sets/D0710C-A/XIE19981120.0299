Israeli cabinet gave its final go-ahead Thursday to the long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank agreed upon in the recent land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.
The approval paved the way for Israeli troops to begin withdrawing from 2 percent of the West Bank in the first of the three phases of further redeployment, in which Israel will hand over a total of 13 percent of the areas.
Israeli officials said the withdrawal would begin as early as Thursday night.
Besides turning the 2 percent into shared control, Israel will turn over 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint control to exclusive Palestinian control.
Israeli Agricultural Minister Rafael Eitan said he was considering leaving the government and might do so later Thursday, Israel Radio reported.

The minister said he felt that he was reaching the end of his period in the government, which came to power in June 1996.
He called for new elections and a reassessment of the current situation.
