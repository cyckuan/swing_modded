Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday he supports the establishment of a Palestinian state but urged that no step be taken unilaterally.
But he suggested that such a move should be negotiated.
Peres said his visit had helped dispel bad feelings between Cyprus and Israel following last month's arrest on the island of two Israelis on suspicion of spying.
Peres said he had ``very, very friendly talks'' with President Glafcos Clerides, ``and I think all the problems were clarified.''
He added that the mission of the two Israelis who have been described as Mossad agents ``was basically a mistake.''
The two Israelis were arrested on Nov. 6 and are to go on trial for spying and gathering military information on Dec. 21.
Peres avoided revealing the nature of the two Israelis' mission but indicated it was linked to anti-terrorism.
``It wasn't bad intentions or any attempt to spy on Cyprus or against Cyprus.
This is nonsense.
It is a local accident which we regret very much,'' he added.
