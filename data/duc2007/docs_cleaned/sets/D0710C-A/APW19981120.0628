Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with spying on Cyprus for a foreign country and will go on trial next month.
The two were also charged with the illegal possession of wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus and Israel.
The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of Larnaca.
Judge Tefkros Economou, after retiring to consider the evidence against them, returned to the court to announce that their trial will begin Dec. 8 as the prosecution requested.
Adjourning the proceedings for a second time to look into a defense request for bail, Economou later decided that the two must continue to be held by Cypriot authorities given the gravity of the charges they faced.
Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides earlier said the Israeli Embassy in Cyprus would keep the two men inside its premises in the capital Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Larnaca, until the trial begins.
Hergov and Damary have been held in the Nisosia Central Prisons since their arrest Nov. 6.
Prosecutor George Papaioannou objected to the bail request, arguing that the two faced ``serious spying charges.''
The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment the two men had rented.
The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an Israeli head of state.
Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia in two separate cars.
Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they were guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
The spying charge states that the two men collected information linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign state'' through a computer between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6.
The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.
