statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office Wednesday regarding two Israelis accused of spying in Cyprus was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
Netanyahu's office said the premier met with the Cypriot ambassador to Israel after reviewing an internal investigation regarding the spy charges.
Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men in custody in Nicosia, Cyprus are Mossad agents.
``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey.''
There was no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked independently of the government.
The two Israelis, who enter Cyprus on false passports, were arrested Nov. 6 in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment the two men had rented.
Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said that shortly before their arrest, the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv.''
Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, which has close relations with Israel but not with Cyprus.
Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the island, are interested in gaining information on the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
Cypriot officials have said that if the two men turn out to be Mossad agents, it would deeply affect relations between the two countries.
In September 1997, Israeli Mossad agents were caught in Jordan trying to assassinate a political figure in the militant Hamas group.
The incident strained Israeli-Jordanian relations.
