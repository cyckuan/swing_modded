Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
Israel's government has not acknowledged that the two are Israeli agents.
Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true.
Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974.
The statement also said the two men were not acting against Cyprus.
Cypriot police arrested the Israelis in the coastal fishing town of Ziyi on Saturday and accused them of spying on a nearby army base.
The Haaretz daily said Thursday that the two men were part of an Israeli intelligence operation held near Ziyi last Friday and Saturday.
The newspaper said it learned from a senior source in Cyprus that the two men had been guarding a meeting of Mossad agents.
They were listening to police scanners to make sure no one approached the meeting place, the newspaper said.
The Mossad told the authorities in Cyprus that it was not interested in damaging Nicosia's sovereignty and that it was simply going about its business.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to ease tensions over the case.
The source in Cyprus said comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that ``of course we'll bring them home'' had damaged chances the two would be quickly released.
