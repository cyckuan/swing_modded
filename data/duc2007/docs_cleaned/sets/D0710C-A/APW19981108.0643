The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot Justice Ministry said Sunday.
There were no other details.
Cypriot police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand hearing Nov. 16.
The two Israelis were arrested Saturday in a small community of Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca.
Cypriot police said they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
The two Israelis were visited Saturday and Sunday by Israeli consulate officials.
Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with Israel in the past two years.
Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy operation.
Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb the missile batteries once they are installed.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, speculated that the two suspects might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a military training exercise in the area.
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as part of their 1996 defense pact.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other countries in the region.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last week.
Cypriot ambassador to Israel Euripides Evriades told Israel's Channel Two TV that he hoped the incident would not harm relations between the two countries.
``We want to look at this through the prism of the good relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these relations,'' Evriades said.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.
