Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Tuesday indicated that he is not considering release of two Israeli agents jailed on Monday for three years.
The president also told reporters that there is no agreement between the two countries so that Igal Damary, 49, and Udi Hargov, 37, can serve their sentence in Israel.
The two Israelis were arrested in early November last year at the small fishing village of Zigi on the Cypriot southern coast and were found carrying radio scanners, a lat-top computer, cell phones and eight maps of the island.
They had pleaded guilty to charges of approaching a restricted military zone and possessing banned listening equipment.
Spying charges pressed against the two Israelis were dropped by the prosecution for lack of evidence.
Clerides said that pardon cannot be granted unless some of the sentence is served, the Prisons Director submits a good report on their conduct and the Attorney General agrees that reasons for pardon exist.
Clerides dismissed press reports that the spying charges were dropped because of pressure.
