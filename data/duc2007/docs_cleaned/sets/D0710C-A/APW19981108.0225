Israel was officially silent Sunday on the subject of two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying, but a government official said Israeli diplomats would likely visit them in prison.
Israeli foreign ministry spokeman Effii Ben-Matityahu had no comment on the arrests other than to note that officials from the Israeli consulate were expected to go to the Nicosia prison where the two were being held.
Cypriot police said the two would be brought before a remand hearing Nov. 16.
In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts that the two arrested Saturday in the community of Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca for allegedly spying on a nearby army base were working for the Mossad secret service.
Cypriot police source said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with Israel in the past two years.
Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy operation.
Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb the missile batteries once they are installed.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's behalf.
Israeli military commentator Oded Granot wrote in Maariv newspaper that the two might have been caught in a training exercise that went wrong.
Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, said methods and devices used by the two were not typical of the Mossad.
He speculated that the two might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as part of their 1996 defense pact.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other countries in the region.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last week.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.
