Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel wants to clarify the issue about the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on charge of spying, with the aim of bringing them back home.
Speaking to Israeli TV Channel 2 Sunday night, Netanyahu said that "every Israeli citizen is important to us.
We will clarify this, and of course we will bring them home."
Uzi Landu, Chairman of Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, has also said that they should be brought back immediately.
Diplomatic activities are widely said to be underway between the two sides, because they want the affair to end quietly.
The Cypriot Justice Ministry issued a brief statement Sunday, saying the two men were not working for Israel.
It did not mention the word "Mossad," Israel's intelligence organization.
Officials in Jerusalem have declined to comment till now, except confirming that the two are Israelis.
Suspects Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, have been remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia for further investigation at an unspecified location, reports from Cyprus said, adding that the two are being held separately.
Cyprus has expressed concern over the military alliance between Turkey and Israel, but is also keen on maintaining good relations with Israel.
This is not the first time this year that Israel has been embarrassed by a "security mishap" in Cyprus.
In April, two Israeli planes were caught flying over a planned missile base in the northwest of the Island.
