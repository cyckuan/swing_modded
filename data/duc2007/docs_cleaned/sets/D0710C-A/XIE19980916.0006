Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel.
Speaking after his meeting Tuesday with Cyprus' House of Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou, Israeli Ambassador to Nicosia Shemi Tzur said his country wants stability in the Eastern Mediterranean and would like to see a solution to the Cyprus problem.
Tzur made the remarks just one day after Arab ambassadors accredited to Cyprus expressed concern about Israeli-Turkish military alliance following their meeting with Kyprianou.
Commenting on statements made Monday by Arab ambassadors to Cyprus that they are worried over the Turkish-Israeli military alliance, Tzur said that "Arab countries should be more worried how to proceed with the peace process with Israel and to leave this sort of things aside."
He said their worries have nothing to do with Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to help "promote peace process with Israel, to convince Palestinians... to come forward to proceed with the peace."
Tzur said that during his meeting with Kyprianou, the Cypriot House president received again the assurances that Israel's cooperation with Turkey has nothing in it to harm Cyprus.
"Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus," Tzur said.
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996 when they signed a military cooperation agreement.
Tzur said his country "is looking for stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, we want to see stability, we want to see the Cyprus problem being solved."
On his part, Kyprianou said that during his discussions with the Israeli ambassador, he raised the issue of the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey because "it creates an atmosphere of concern to both Cyprus and Greece and to other countries in the region."
He said Tzur told him that the alliance is of a technical and commercial nature and has nothing to do with Cyprus, nor should it affect the very good relations between the two countries or the relations between Israel and Greece.
Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect issues which seriously concern Cyprus.
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since the opening of its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.
