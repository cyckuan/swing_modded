Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis jailed in Cyprus.
The two Israelis, Igar Damary, 49 and Udi Hargov, 37, were sentenced in February to three years in jail for approaching a restricted area and possessing banned listening devices without the permission of the Cyprus authorities.
Cyprus government said Thursday that President Clerides decided to grant pardon to the two Israelis and suspend their prison terms as their continuing imprisonment "no longer served the national interest."
"President Weizman had a long and very warm and friendly conversation with President Clerides on Thursday evening during which he thanked the President of Cyprus for suspending the sentence," the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Friday.
Later Thursday, Barak also called Clerides to thank him personally for his move.
Clerides has accepted an invitation from his Israeli counterpart to pay an official visit to Israel.
Weizman paid an official visit to Cyprus last November.
