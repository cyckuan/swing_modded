civil jury found former American football star O.J.
Simpson liable for the wrongful death of his ex-wife and her friend, according to television report from Santa Monica, California on Tuesday.
Simpson, 49, was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal trial for the slashing murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, but the victims' relatives filed a civil wrongful death suit against him, seeking monetary damages.
The jury ordered him to pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars in compensatory damages and will return Thursday to decide whether to award millions more in punitive damages.
Earlier Tuesday, the jury in the wrongful death suit was read back statements by several witnesses, including testimony pertaining to Simpson's whereabouts on the evening of June 1, when Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were killed outside her home.
