Is America ready to welcome O.J.
Simpson back as a commercial spokesman?
Simpson, the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies, said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants to have adequate legal representation.
He said he was paid only enough to cover his expenses.
Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at minority defendants.
``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.
The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 1994 criminal trial.
He was acquitted on charges of murdering ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.
Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
Any income he receives can be seized by the estate of Ms. Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the judgment.
Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's business.
``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola University Law School.
``Assuming they are targeting an African-American audience, it's still iffy,'' she said.
``And it's kind of sad.
Isn't there anybody else in the African-American community who can speak out for justice?''
Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison.
``These people lost years of their lives,'' Simpson said.
``If any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail.''
He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do bad things.
Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''
