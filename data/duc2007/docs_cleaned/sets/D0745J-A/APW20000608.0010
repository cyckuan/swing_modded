Simpson will take a lie detector test if someone puts up a $3 million reward to catch his ex-wife's killer, defense attorney F. Lee Bailey announced on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Wednesday night.
If Simpson passes the test, the reward money would be put in a trust fund and paid out for information about the crime.
If he fails, the letter of credit pledging the money will be dissolved, Bailey said.
The results will be made public either way.
''It'll be publicly seen, win, lose or draw,'' said the famed defense attorney, who represented Simpson at his trial.

He's trying to get enough money out there to smoke someone out,'' Bailey told King from West Palm Beach, Fla. On Monday, the former football player told The Associated Press that he never has taken a lie-detector test but was hooked up briefly to a polygraph machine to see how it worked.
Bailey on Friday had said during a Florida hearing where his license to practice law is being challenged that he suggested Simpson be stopped from completing a lie-detector test after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
However, he was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
King also had Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, on the program.
Goldman said he hopes ''no one is stupid enough to give money ... so he (Simpson) can smile at the world and claim he's innocent again.''
