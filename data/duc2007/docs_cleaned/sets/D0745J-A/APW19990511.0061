There is no agreement yet on the custody of O.J.
Simpson's younger children, their grandfather said Tuesday, contradicting statements from Simpson's lawyer that he would retain custody.
Lou Brown, the father of Simpson's slain ex-wife, said, ``Nothing has been agreed upon.
There is no agreement.
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, told The Associated Press on Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
``It's supposed to be confidential.''
Brown's lawyer did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Simpson was out of town and couldn't be reached.
The children, Justin, 10, and Sydney, 13, live with Simpson.
Brown and his wife, Juditha, sued for custody and lost until an appeals court interceded.
The California Supreme Court ruled in February the custody case could go back to court for another trial.
But Leckie said Monday that Simpson would keep custody of the children in a settlement with the Browns.
