Simpson will go on the Internet next week to field questions from the public and try once again to convince America that he didn't kill his ex-wife and her friend.
''I'm not opposed to talking to the public about my case,'' he said Tuesday.
''Most of them don't know the facts of my case.
When I talk to them there's usually a 180-degree change in attitude.
''My guilt was established in the public eye, not in the courtroom.
It was established in the media,'' Simpson said in a phone interview from Florida, which will soon be his new home.
He said he plans to lease a house in the Miami area where he will live with his two younger children.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
He said his two-hour stint on the Internet on July 27 will take place in Tampa, the headquarters of Entertainment Network Inc., the company sponsoring the event.
He said he will receive no payment for his participation except a pledge from the company to contribute money to his three favorite charities.
Those who sign on to his ''chat room'' will pay a fee to talk with him.
Simpson said he didn't know how much it would cost to log on, how much was going to charity or the address for the Web chat.
He said those with the right computer equipment will be able to see and hear him.
Others will receive answers typed in by a stenographer present in the room with him.
Simpson said the company sponsoring the two-hour chat has become known for its voyeuristic Web sites in which people can look in on places such as college dorms.
He expects that some will sign on just to berate him, but said he's become used to that and is confident he can get people to listen to his side of the story.
Simpson, who insists he is innocent, said he still receives tips about possible leads in the case and hopes the Internet site may attract people with helpful information.
As for his move to Florida, he said he had wanted to move there for the past 10 years, even before his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman were slain in June 1994.
Had it not been for a prolonged custody battle over his children, he said he would have relocated earlier.
