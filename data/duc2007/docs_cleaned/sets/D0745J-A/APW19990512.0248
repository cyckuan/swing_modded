Is there an agreement for O.J.
Simpson to keep custody of his two youngest children?
Simpson's lawyer says yes.
Their grandfather says no.
The children's lawyer thinks so, and Simpson isn't commenting.
Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother's parents.
Ms. Simpson's father, Lou Brown, insisted Tuesday that no custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson's lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press.
``It's supposed to be confidential.''
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
Simpson refused to comment and seemed distressed that his lawyer was discussing the matter publicly.
Asked what was holding up resolution of the children's custody, Brown said, ``It depends on him,'' referring to Simpson and adding: ``He's out of town.''
Marjorie Fuller, the attorney representing the children, said Tuesday she has not been involved in the negotiations but believes an agreement is close.
``My job is to hang back and let Mr. Simpson and the Browns work it out,'' she said.
``But as far as I know, everybody's been working real hard on an agreement and it was waiting to be signed.''
The Brown family lawyer, Kimberly Knill, did not return a phone call.
The children, who live with Simpson, often visit Brown and his wife, Juditha.
The Browns lost their first custody suit, but the California Supreme Court ruled in February the case could be retried.
Leckie said Monday that everyone agreed ``it's in the best interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the courts any further.''
Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of Ms. Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
But he was held liable in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Brown and Goldman families, who were awarded $33.5 million.
