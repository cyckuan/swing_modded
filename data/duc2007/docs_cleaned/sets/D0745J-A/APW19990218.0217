The man who paid $255,500 for O.J.
Simpson's Heisman Trophy was identified Thursday as a Philadelphia sheet metal dealer who said he wanted to impress his girlfriend.
Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, showed up at an auction house to collect the trophy, which was awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a star at the University of Southern California.
Kriessman bought the prize anonymously at a court-ordered auction of Simpson memorabilia Tuesday.
``One of the first reasons was I wanted to impress my girlfriend,'' Kriessman said.
``It represents the story of a man who rose to be a superstar and lost it all overnight.
Kriessman was given the same nickname as Simpson when he played rough touch football in his 20s in Philadelphia.
His girlfriend, whom Kriessman didn't identify, apparently wasn't the only one impressed by the trophy.
``Everybody's been calling,'' he said.
``Seems everybody wants to touch it, everybody wants to be photographed with it.''
Kriessman is the co-owner of Triad Steel Inc, a 10-year-old company that buys and sells sheet metal.
Partner Edward O'Brien said Triad has annual sales of about $20 million.
The auction raised $430,000 to help pay off the $33.5 million a jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the slayings of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman.
Kriessman also bought a couple of jerseys and a glass trophy, but the Heisman was the top-ticket item.
Kriessman, a Philadelphia Eagles fan, said he has never met Simpson.
Asked if he would like to hear from the former Buffalo Bills star and perhaps pose with him and the Heisman, he said: ``I'd have to think about it.''
