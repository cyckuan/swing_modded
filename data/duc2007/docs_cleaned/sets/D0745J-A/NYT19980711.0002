Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of domestic violence.
``This foundation is not about Mr. Simpson,'' she said.
Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal ``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held responsible for his actions.''
Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his fundamental right.
You're supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings would say it was legal.''
Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge judgment.
For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a paid interview to a German television station and asked the station to pay the money to a third party.
``We'll continue to chase him and file suit against those he fraudulently conveys money to,'' Goldman said.
In February 1997, a civil jury found Simpson liable for the stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
The appeal, filed 17 months after that verdict, could take months or even years to resolve.
In 1995, a criminal jury acquitted Simpson of murder charges.
Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary rulings.''
The former football star's attorneys said the judge should have excluded evidence that Simpson had a history of violence against his former wife.
They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
The brief criticizes the inclusion of several civil trial witnesses, including a veterinary clinic worker who claims she saw the couple fight over a fur coat, and a former security guard who testified Simpson smashed a windshield and dented a Mercedes-Benz coupe with a baseball bat in a jealous rage.
Peter Gelblum, one of the Goldmans' attorneys, predicted the appeal wouldn't have much success.
``It's the same issues we litigated twice already in the trial court,'' he said.
``Once a batterer, always a batterer,'' he said.
``He was liable for murdering Nicole and Ron.''
The Goldmans' attorneys said they will continue to pursue Simpson's assets.
Later this year they plan to auction off his Heisman Trophy, Gelblum said.
Los Angeles attorney Nathanial Friedman, who successfully sued Charles Manson on behalf of the family of one of Manson's victims, called Simpson's appeal ``an absolutely outrageous abuse of the taxpayer-supported court system of California.''
``His guilt is so self-evident that any reasonable person says he would have emigrated to Brazil or Mozambique or some other place if he had the slightest shred of decency,'' Friedman said.
