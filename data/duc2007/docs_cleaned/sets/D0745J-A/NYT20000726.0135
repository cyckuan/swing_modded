Simpson remains in the public eye, to pride that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J.
Simpson's acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral emotions?
Is it Simpson himself?
Or is it the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum?
Do the news and entertainment media cover O.J.
Even experts differ.
``I'm bored with the subject, and my students are.
They yawn when I bring it up,'' said Frankie Bailey, a University of Albany specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture.
People may just be dragged along behind the media.''
Darnell M. Hunt disagrees.
``People will always be somewhat titillated by it.''
To Joshua Meyrowitz, professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire, it's ``shortcut journalism.
That's the reason why O.J.
He added, ``It's not so much the public is interested, it's that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured out how simple it is to report these cases.
It doesn't require research, or understanding of complex issues.''
Meanwhile, on the World Wide Web, the 645 members of one O.J.
They even have labels for their split, the ``No-J's'' and the ``Pro-J's.''
The 1,272 topics include everything from the gruesome (``Nicole, whose trachea was severed, did not even aspirate a single drop of blood...'') to the mundane (``Kato saw the golf bag about 10:55 p.m. outside the front door, when Simpson was still in the house...'') One member is Betty Parker, 60, a General Motors retiree in Trenton, N.J. She's pondered, or researched, or written on, or read about the case ``from Day One,'' she said, and continues to do so.
At the outset, ``I didn't even like O.J.,'' Parker said.
``But I started watching, and I found myself thinking, `That's strange,''' about so many details.
The bloody glove, for instance.
``Why would a killer leave that behind at the scene?''
Or Simpson's injured finger.
``If he was in a life-and-death struggle he would have practically sliced it off, but it was just a tiny cut.''
For Parker, such nagging questions never have been answered, and in their wake is a different America.
``As an African American, I feel my people are being punished for taking this position,'' she said.
``There are people in board rooms making decisions, who are still embittered over the O.J.
Simpson verdict.
And those decisions are their retribution.''
USC's Hunt, author of ``O.J.
Simpson Facts and Fictions: News Rituals in the Construction of Reality,'' agreed that race is a prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point.
Race, as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
Gender, with the allegations of domestic abuse.
And class, with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a ``dream team'' of attorneys.
``And those are issues we continue to wrestle with,'' Hunt added.
Once again, however, there's disagreement.
``The people I encounter, the subject of O.J.
One thing isn't in dispute: that O.J.
Simpson is a permanent fixture in American society.
``He's outspoken, he continues to talk about it,'' Bailey said.
``As an academic, I'll be interested to see how many hits he gets on his new Web site.''
Will Simpson ever be able to stroll down a street and not evoke a response?
``Oh, absolutely not,'' Hunt said.
Until he dies, he'll be a symbol of where we are as a society.''
