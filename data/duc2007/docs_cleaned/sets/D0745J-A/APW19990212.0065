Potential bidders expressed qualms about buying O.J.
Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction.
``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him.''
Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned.
The catalog noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as ``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque.
Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy.
``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the Butterfield and Butterfield auction house.
The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
They won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the murders in criminal court.
Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom.''
He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to help satisfy the $33.5 million civil court judgment against him.
``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown pockets,'' Beardsley said.
Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No.
