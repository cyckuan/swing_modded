Days after O.J.
Simpson's ex-wife and a man were stabbed to death, the football star underwent a polygraph test that F. Lee Bailey says he stopped because it was not going well.
Bailey said Friday, during testimony in a Florida courtroom where his license to practice law is being challenged, that shortly after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
Bailey, who has said he is an expert on polygraph examinations, said Shapiro wanted his advice about a polygraph test of Simpson in progress that was not going well.
Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too emotional a time for Simpson.
Bailey said he advised Shapiro that if Simpson was to take a polygraph examination it should only include questions about Goldman's death.
Bailey said Shapiro took the test results and no one has seen them since.
He said Shapiro has said he doesn't have the test results.
Bailey did not elaborate further on the polygraph episode.
Messages left for Shapiro Sunday afternoon were not immediately returned.
Simpson has said he never took a polygraph test, but was hooked up to the machine to see how it worked.
In the civil case against Simpson, lawyers for the Goldman family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the deaths but the civil jury found him liable for the crimes.
He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
The accounting of the polygraph incident in the Simpson case came in Bailey's lengthy accounting of how his time was spent defending another client, international drug trafficker Claude Duboc.
Bailey is accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of stock Duboc held in a pharmaceutical company to pay Bailey's legal expenses.
