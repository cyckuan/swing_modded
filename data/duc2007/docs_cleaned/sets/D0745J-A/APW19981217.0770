Simpson has ``not paid one penny'' of the dlrs 12 million wrongful-death judgment against him.

So we said, `IRS, you're nuts,''' said Louis H. Brown, Ms. Simpson's father and administrator of her trust.
The estate, created to support the Simpsons' two children, petitioned the U.S. Tax Court in Washington last week to intervene after failing to reach an agreement with IRS officials, Brown said.
Lawyers for Simpson also declined comment.
