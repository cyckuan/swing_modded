judge has declined to order a reporter to provide prosecutors and defense lawyers with notes and tape recordings of an interview with a defendant in a racially charged murder trial.
An FBI agent testified that the reporter told him that the defendant, Randall Lee Rojas, had admitted committing a murder in 1995.
He identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala. Lawyers for two of Rojas' co-defendants, Ritch Bryant and Jessica Colwell, sought the material as evidence that their clients had no hand in the Nov. 25, 1995, beating death of a black man, Milton Walker Jr.
In a hearing on Oct. 27, Judge Lance A. Ito of the Los Angeles Superior Court said the interview contained ``nothing close to being exculpatory'' for the defense.
He noted the material would assist the prosecution's case, but found the evidence was available through other means and that there was no need to pierce California's shield law, which essentially protects reporters from being compelled to provide evidence to the government.
The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups, and Intelligence Report covers right-wing extremists.
Rojas' lawyer, Donald Calabria, questioned how Ms. O'Kane had entered the Los Angeles County Jail without filling out required media forms and had interviewed his client without his knowledge.
Judge Ito noted that a Los Angeles sheriff's department investigator helped arrange the interview and even participated, posing questions for Rojas.
Ms. O'Kane disclosed a portion of the interview to an FBI agent about a month later, though her editor, Mark Potok, said in an interview that the disclosure was inadvertent and that the magazine's reporters do not collaborate with law enforcement authorities.
