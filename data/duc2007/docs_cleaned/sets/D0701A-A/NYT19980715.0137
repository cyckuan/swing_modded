Sure, she evoked the wrath of Catholics, including a hypocritical Madonna.
But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an industry lousy with pretense.
Here was a beautiful woman who desexualized herself by shaving her head, a fiesty zealot with the voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine.
She championed Public Enemy, flipped off the Grammys, and was threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled Banner.
Her actions were so jaw-droppingly over, it was hard not to admire their raw loopiness, though they overshadowed her talent and undermined record sales.
Now 31 and twice a mother, O'Connor seems a bit less prickly.
In the current Spin , O'Connor, on the road this suumer as part of the Lilith Fair, tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets about actions which brought her grief in the past.
Quite a lot of the other things like the national anthem and the Grammys I wouldn't do now because they're just young moody .''
Likewise, she has little regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a fashion accessory.
They don't cause trouble and they play a game.
They're not controversial in any way.''
Speaking of playing games, is Jesse Camp for real?
Is Camp, anointed the newest idiot in MTV's village after beating 4,000 others in the network's ``I Wanna Be a VJ'' contest in April, really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one of his wool leg warmers over our eyes?
It seems like it may be the latter.
His dad, J. Holden Camp, chairman of the humanities department at the University of Hartford, tells Spin his son, whose real name is Josh, ``is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a facade.
He did well in school, and he had a lot of fun with drama.''
Looks like he still is.
You can practically smell aftershave on every page.
So in addition to a vodka primer Ketel One gets a A+ for its ``exceptionally clean finish there's Scott Bindley's entertaining mini-opus, ``In Defense of Bachelorhood.''
According to Bindley, married life can be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers, minivans, and sex as often as the World Cup.
Hence, men should be live it up as bachelors.
Singledom, he says, means more time and money for a cool sports car, titanium golf clubs, and a satellite dish which can get every sporting event from Little League to logrolling.
But Bindley is quick to say everything he writes ``is predicated on the belief that the bachelor existence should be temporary.
We are not advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa's He-Man Women-Haters Club.''
The women of Bust seem like they couldn't care less if they make men uncomfortable.
This smart New York-based quarterly is dedicated to celebrating all things female, and if the boys can't handle it, well, they don't have to go home, but they've got to the heck the out of here.
In short, chicks rule.
This month's edition is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the Lavernes to our Shirleys.
There's Donna Lovell's too-true feature, ``Six Reasons Why Your Girlfriend is Better Than a Boyfriend,'' and ``Bosom Buddies,'' a funny meditation of the best girlfriends of all time, including Lucy and Ethel, Cagney and Lacy, Patsy and Edina of the late great ``Absolutely Fabulous.''
For nearly a decade, Queen Latifah, the first lady of hip-hop, has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether she prefers princesses to princes in her queendom.
Speculation on her sexuality only intensified after she played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996 urban caper ``Set It Off.''
So in the current issue of The Source, she pumps ``Order in the Court,'' her first CD in five years, and gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls.
Mostly, though, she talks about those rumors.
``I'll never answer the question.
I'd rather have you die wanting to know.
You can assume whatever you want.
I'm me.
I'm not ashamed of who I am, and who I sleep with is nobody's businesses.''
Which is very similar to what George Michael used to say before he came out earlier this year not that there's anything wrong with that.
In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column.
Dees has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation.
But then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC's list of hate groups.
Writes Brett Johnson, ``If you want to make friends and influence people in the 'hood, dissing (Louis) Farrakhan and the Nation is not the place to start.''
Perhaps.
But since Farrakhan has made anti-Semitic remarks, as well as homophobic and misogynistic comments, he belongs on Dees's list.
So to the Source, that slap is right back at 'cha.
