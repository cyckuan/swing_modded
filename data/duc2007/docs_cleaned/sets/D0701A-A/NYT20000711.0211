It's a free country.
But two upcoming cable specials may leave viewers wondering if too much freedom is a bad thing.
HBO's ``HATE.COM: Extremists on the Internet'' and Discovery Channel's ``Warnings from a Small Town'' both look at hate crimes and at how ``hate sites'' on the Internet are preying on impressionable young people with low self-esteem.
According to ``HATE.COM,'' many acts of domestic terrorism, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack at a Jewish community day-care center in Los Angeles, are not the work of ``lone wolves'' but of soldiers in a loosely organized army whose marching orders come via neo-Nazi, white-supremacist and homophobic Web sites.
Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a crusader against intolerance, says the answer is not to censor the Internet.
So-called Internet ``filters'' that remove hateful language are often misguided, he says.
``You might eliminate things that would be positive responses to hate on the Web.
``The best filter,'' he continued, ``is an educated public.''
Steven Stroud, a former skinhead who learned to hate as a teenager in Seattle, couldn't agree more.
Before he was taken in by a loving foster family, Stroud says hating other people, especially others different from him, made him feel superior.
Now a community activist in Portland, Stroud tries to reach other skinheads by conducting interventions.
One such exercise with a boy named Josh is described in ``Warnings from a Small Town,'' the third installment in Discovery's series, ``Hate Violence: No Simple Answers.''
With information from the Internet, Josh created a model of a concentration camp for a school project and received an A from his teacher.
He showed how whites belong ``on top'' and all other races belong ``under the ground.''
Stroud says kids like Josh often feel that adults have let them down, through divorce, abuse, etc.
``The youth are looking for something,'' Stroud said.
``The kids are actually looking to this electronic medium for answers they can't get from adults.''
``Warnings from a Small Town'' airs Aug. 30 on Discovery.
On her most recent shuttle trip last May, U.S. astronaut Mary Ellen Weber and her crew mates visited the International Space Station to replace three fire extinguishers, four fans and 10 smoke detectors because the warranties had expired.
Is it any wonder Americans don't get jazzed about space exploration anymore?
But Weber says she's OK with that.
``The same way that air travel is not quite the same event that it was when the Wright brothers flew an airplane, ... that's the era we're moving into with space,'' says Weber, who has flown on two shuttle missions and logged more than 450 hours in Earth orbit.
``It's not necessarily about trying to get to one particular place and all cheer afterwards,'' she says.
``We're trying to take space and adopt it into our lives, to improve our lives, so I'm not upset at all that there isn't the same amount of excitement.
It just means we've moved on to a much greater level.''
Make that split level, as in ``contemporary, high-tech home on spacious lot with spectacular views.''
That's what the International Space Station will be when construction is completed, probably in 2005.
And even if Weber can forgive America's lack of enthusiasm for space exploration, the Discovery Channel can't.
On Dec. 10, Discovery will air ``Inside the Space Station,'' an hourlong look at probably the greatest engineering marvel of our time.
It will be the first of four quarterly specials dedicated to the final frontier.
Subsequent programs will look at other moons in our solar system, violent weather on other planets, and comets, asteroids and meteors.
