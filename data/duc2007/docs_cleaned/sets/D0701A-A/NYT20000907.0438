Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury.
The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their lawyers.
The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse, even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of hate.''
The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one that could force the group out of its 19-acre property.
``I'd like to say publicly for Butler to get the message that we consider the every single asset of that compound to be the property of the plaintiffs in this case,'' Dees said after the verdict was announced.
The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.
But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of Independence who were harassed for their views.
``This is nothing,'' he said, after the verdict.
``We have planted seeds.''
Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money.
We will spread the message.''
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees said in closing arguments.
Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler, he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of drunken young men.
Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts and all manner of people that drift in and out.''
Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a wedding.
They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun.
He had been in the Job Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it.
He quickly retrieved the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the police after the incident.
At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the car.
They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the car into a ditch.
In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45, struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her.
She and her son testified that they thought they were going to be killed.
Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian.
She testified that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor white farm girl.''
At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the other men had fired at the Keenans.
Under questioning, Yeager read portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to ever walk the face of this earth.''
Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a fugitive.
The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point repeated by Steele.
