In the years since, there have been other incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by current or former postal workers.
On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.''
It was the first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
The rest is linguistic history.
Three-year-olds know what going postal means.
Is the Postal Service happy about this?
Not at all.
So, calmly, it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that with charts and myriad statistics strikes out at the notion that your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an Uzi out of his mail pouch.
```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the national workforce.''
Retail workers, it says, are eight times as likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
The study is a serious one.
``The level of violence throughout the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers a variety of remedies.
But it also seems intent on clearing the Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is that it has so many workers as a civilian employer, it's second only to Wal-Mart.
But it will be rough.
And ``going Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
Restaurant That's All Lobby Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci Gulch.
Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other Washington restaurant.
Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father, Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy, a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the Vatican), provided a simple explanation.
So many closed doors, he said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits as business expenses as possible 100 percent for a banquet, but only 50 percent for a regular meal.
The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly.
And if political junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms carefully, they might just be able to figure out the behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that fairly sizzles with accommodation a steakhouse.
Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether to deploy a national missile defense system.
He said he would not do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes.
The president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed to intercept incoming missiles.
Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S. missile defense.
Temps, Unite The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often receive inferior pay and benefits.
But for years they were off limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user company and temp agency agreed something that rarely happened.
The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's permission to do so.
Awards After an Uprising More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971 Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled.
The awards, which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died.
Still, the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of Attica.''
No Terminator, Please The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the first robotic system that can design and build other robots with almost no human help.
The technique will merely speed up the process of designing robots, said Dr. Jordan B. Pollack, a professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the researchers, and sharply drop the cost.
Crime Continues to Decline Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its lowest level since the government began its annual national crime survey 26 years ago.
Law enforcement officials credited crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.
The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9 percent.
But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and property crimes committed last year.
The French and Corsica A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement to resign in protest.
Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive constitutional issue in France.
But the plan has also gained wide backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three decades.
Next, the Aryan Nations In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a campaign to drive them out of business.
The Aryan Nations compound has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.
His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998.
Dees' goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to surrender their compound in payment.
Immigrant Influx in Nevada By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at the gambling table.
The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent.
Many of those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.
California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population 10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.
Eh, Get a Horse It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.
Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E. Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995.
The judge said he intended to issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles.
Analysts estimated the cost could run as high as $250 million.
Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on appeal.
New Trial for American After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can get.
That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for terrorism.
The case has been a thorn ever since in relations between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.
Finding on Death Row Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.
Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr., who was sent to death row in 1980.
His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal magistrate later found.
On Aug. 18, David Folsom, a U.S. District judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.
