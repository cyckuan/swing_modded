white supremacist arrested after buying hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said.
Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a federal agent testified at a federal court hearing.
``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Friday.
There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might have been targeted in the national and state capital cities.
An ATF representative did not immediately return calls for comment Saturday.
Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was apparently a silencer.
Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record.
If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Bordenkircher.
No charges were immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase.
Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday, arriving with a loaded, cocked .45-caliber pistol on his hip and his 20-month-old son in his arms.
The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto testified.
He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center.
