At 81, Richard Girnt Butler knows he's in his twilight days.
He hopes the rest of the world is too.
For 27 years, Butler has preached about ``the great race war'' from his swastika- and crucifix-adorned pulpit here in the Selkirk Mountain foothills.
``We're approaching the end-time period.
I'd like to see the final conclusion, but that's up to my Father,'' says Butler, tromping across the United Nations and Israeli flags he uses as doormats at the entrance to his chapel.
In the process of creating a ``white homeland,'' the founder of the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, Butler has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism.
Buford R. Furrow Jr., a former Aryan Nations security guard charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler disciple to make news for racist violence.
Butler is unrepentant.
``If a Catholic priest sodomizes an altar boy and they've had a whole string of them do you blame the church for it?
The pope?''
While offering a safehouse for neo-Nazi pilgrims, Butler's 20-acre compound has also fostered disciples who engaged in murder, robbery and racial assaults.
According to civil rights groups, those with ties to Butler include: Members of The Order, who robbed armored cars and assassinated Denver radio host Alan Berg in the 1980s; Colville native Chevie Kehoe, convicted recently on homicide charges; Mark Thomas, Butler's former Pennsylvania state leader, who robbed banks to fund a white revolution; Nathan Thill, a skinhead and former Butler organizer in Denver, who last November confessed to killing a man because the victim had black skin.
I'm not violent, but I failed Hypocrisy 101 in school.''
Regarding Furrow's alleged day-care assault, he says, ``I don't favor hurting children, but I can't get worked up about the wounding of some of my enemies, even though they're children.''
Quickly, he changes the subject.
Civil rights groups that have fought Butler over the decades now wonder about the future of his organization.
The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler, hoping to bankrupt him in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in Coeur d'Alene in January.
The suit was filed on behalf of Victoria Keenan, a Seattle woman, and her son, Jason, who were shot at near the compound in July 1998 by Aryan Nations security guards.
In police reports, Keenan said the guards mistook her car's backfire for gunfire after she stopped on the roadway and restarted the car.
The guards, according to police reports, barreled out of the compound after her in a pickup truck, chased her two miles down the road and shot at her car with assault rifles.
Kootenai County sheriff's deputies documented bullet holes in her car.
Butler's security chief, Edward ``Jesse'' Warfield, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced in May to as many as five years in prison.
Two other guards remain fugitives.
Mark Potok of the SPLC said the group is refraining from comments about Butler pending a trial.
In the past, the SPLC has said Butler and his group did more to foment modern racism nationwide, and to tarnish the Northwest in the process, than any other neo-Nazi group.
``The Jews and I are at war,'' Butler says.
And he believes the lawsuit is part of that war.
The SPLC, headed by Morris Dees in Alabama, is known for having used civil law to break the back of the Ku Klux Klan.
``It's harassment.
The sole purpose is to bankrupt me,'' complains Butler, who says a less well-financed Aryan Nations legal defense fund has been set up for him.
``I've had to spend $55,000 so far.''
Regarding Keenan, Butler would say only that ``allegedly, she was shooting at our sign out there.''
Butler bought the land off Rimrock Road about 10 miles north of Coeur d'Alene for his compound back in 1972, when he was in California working for Lockheed.
The road winds over hills, past horse farms, fields of fresh-cut alfalfa and creeks where kids fish, a sea of tranquility interrupted by the jarring red, white and blue Aryan Nations sign at the foot of Butler's property.
Passing beneath the two flags at the entrance, one the Confederate stars and bars, the other a 13-star U.S. flag, the driveway climbs past a meadow of flowers until it rounds a corner, where a ``whites only'' sign precedes an empty guardhouse.
The grounds resemble any of the other small retirement ranches nearby, except for the big brown stage in the middle of the compound, and a big Nazi swastika on a corrugated roof.
In Butler's Aryan heyday, the compound was a popular mecca for racist sympathizers from around the world who assailed whole groups of people, seeking to unify neo-Nazi forces.
``who's who of the hate movement'' visited the place over the years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam; and Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
Last week, however, only seven or eight people were living on or visiting the compound.
Butler holds court at his desk, piled with papers, in a small office next to the church.
Gifts and framed documents hang on his office walls, including several pictures of Hitler.
Beneath his desk, his 5-year-old purebred German shepherd, Fritz, instinctively growls at strangers.
Fritz follows Butler everywhere, sometimes joining another German shepherd, Eva, roaming the grounds.
There are lots of swastikas, one made by a follower in prison from folded Camel cigarette filters; another crocheted, and another made of folded chewing-gum wrappers.
Among his favorite gifts is a line of carved ``little Klansmen.''
Behind his chair, above a whip sent by an admirer and a Nazi helmet, is a tot's drawing, orange silhouettes of a Klansman pasted on yellow paper, with blue crayon scribbling.
It was made by the daughter of Christian, his receptionist.
It was pretty neat.''
Like his idol Hitler, Butler likes kids.
Race is a religion with Butler.
The 150-year-old ideology known as Christian Identity, which has the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory through which he believes that he and others of white northern European descent are the true Israelites tricked out of their birthright by Jews, and forced to live with other races.
Not everyone can understand the message of his race-based Christian Identity religion, Butler says.
White people are like radio receivers in their ability to hear the message, says Butler.
``Jesus said let those who have ears hear.''
Among Butler's more startling hypotheses: Whites, not American Indians, were the first in the Americas.
And Albert Einstein was brilliant only because he was taught by Germans.
He dislikes televangelists and spits out the word ``Judeo-Christian'' to describe the followers of mainstream Christian faiths.
Even followers of the World Wide Church of the Creator, white separatists, are heretics in that they have compiled their own Bible instead of relying on the original, he says.
How would Butler explain his reverence for Hitler and the swastika to those thousands of World War II veterans lying in Normandy graveyards, who died fighting what those symbols stood for?
Butler, born in Bennett, Colo., on Feb. 23, 1918, is proud of his own German extraction, and says the war should never have been fought on the European theater.
When the family moved to East Los Angeles after the Depression, Butler studied aeronautical engineering and science at a city college.
He then got a part-time job at 25 cents an hour at an aircraft company that sent him to Bangalore, India, to overhaul planes for the Royal Indian Air Force.
Butler and his wife, Betty, who died in December 1995, were married in 1941.
During the war, Butler said he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and taught aircraft hydraulics to mechnics in the China-Burma theatre.
Butler said he never agreed with fighting Germany, and was invigorated by newsreels of marching Germans.
His racial activism, he said, began after returning from the war when ``things just didn't seem right'' and he became an admirer of Sen. Joe McCarthy's movement about communism.
Butler's activism was galvanized during a signature campaign to expose communist teachers, when he met William Potter Gale, a retired Army colonel who had served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's staff, who introduced Butler to Christian Identity.
Butler also met George Lincoln Rockwell, a former Navy pilot who founded the American Nazi Party.
Through Gale, Butler said he met and studied under ``my mentor,'' Dr. Wesley Swift, pastor of the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation in Lancaster, Calif., whose Christian Identity preaches that Eve mated with the devil, begetting Jews.
Now Butler is preparing to pass the torch, but not in the heavily mentored fashion in which he was ordained.
Butler last year appointed an heir apparent, Newman Britton, a longtime Aryan follower from Escondido, Calif., and the latest in a string of annointed successors who faded away over the years in philosophical differences.
His compound could disappear even without the lawsuit.
In January, one of Butler's two daughters, who don't share his neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs, said she and her husband would sell the 19-acre site, worth about $200,000, upon his death.
When he bought the compound in 1972, Butler hoped it would be the genesis of a white homeland, something his Christian Identity beliefs claim white people have been denied.
Even if the compound doesn't survive, he's confident in his racist religion.
``It's all pre-ordained.
There's no way you can jump off of a cliff and not proceed to the judgment that you will hit the ground.
You can't stop halfway.''
