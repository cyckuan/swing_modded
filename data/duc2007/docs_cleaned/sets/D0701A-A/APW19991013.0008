The city council has declared the Ku Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as well in a resolution approved after an emotional debate.
The resolution was approved on a voice vote Tuesday after council members were assured it would not infringe on anyone's constitutional rights.
``The United States has a no-tolerance policy for terrorist organizations,'' said councilman Kwadjo Campbell.
``This is an unprecedented move, undoubtedly.''
Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., said this may be the first municipality to designate the Klan a terrorist group.
The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago.
The resolution only expresses the opinion of council and doesn't create law, city attorneys said.
If the Klan wants to march, they may apply for a permit.
Sponsor Wendell Gilliard had said when he first proposed the resolution that he wanted to prevent the Klan from holding rallies in the city.
It has been several years since the group marched in Charleston.
``This is not a black thing.
This is a human thing,'' Gilliard said.
``This is about race relations.
This is about saving lives.''
The resolution says Charleston welcomes diverse opinions ``but not those views that instigate fear, bias, bigotry and hate.''
It condemns any organization ``whose purpose is to encourage hate of any individual, race, religion, culture or way of life.''
Several council members were concerned the resolution could lead to lawsuits and a resumption of Klan marches.
Horace King, leader of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina, refused to comment.
