jury on Thursday awarded $6.3 million to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards outside the white supremacist group's north Idaho headquarters.
The jury found that Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler, the group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc., were negligent in the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago.
The Keenans' attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award more than $11 million in punitive damages.
Dees, of the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom, comparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring northern Idaho a haven for racists.
''This is nothing,'' Butler said.
''We have planted seeds.
Most of north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped multiculturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it.''
Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000 in compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin disposing of their assets.
''We intend to enforce this verdict.
We intend to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' he said.
''We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully, through the judicial process, close that sad chapter in this nation's history.''
Victoria Keenan, 44, spoke briefly, thanking the jury, her lawyers and her family.
''Without them, I don't think I could have done all this,'' she said.
Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said he will move for a new trial.
If that fails, he will appeal and may also seek to have the judgment amount reduced.
Butler would have to post a $9 million bond to appeal.
''You can write the epitaph for that now.''
The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc. 90 percent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.
Butler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent negligent and liable for $600,000.
Yeager was assessed $100,000 in punitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.
The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan $80,000 in compensatory damages.
Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not responsible.
Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took responsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to implicate Butler.
They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire from the Keenans and perceived a threat.
Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.
Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield, Yeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.
The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.
Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are inferior.
His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who founded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford Furrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care center last summer.
From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100 acolytes.
The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's birthday.
Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate groups.
In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has never lost.
In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile, Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building.
In 1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi skinheads.
