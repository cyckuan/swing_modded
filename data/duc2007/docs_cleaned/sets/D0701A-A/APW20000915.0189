Facing eviction from its compound in northern Idaho, the Aryan Nations may move its annual white supremacist gathering to Pennsylvania next year.
The news was posted on the neo-Nazi group's Web site Friday, a week after the group was slapped with a $6.3 million judgment in a civil lawsuit.
The compound is scheduled to be seized on Sept. 29 and the assets sold to satisfy a portion of the judgment due to two people who sued the group after they were assaulted by Aryan Nations' guards.
The notice was the first indication that the lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, may drive the group out of Idaho.
Kreis wrote that if the compound is lost, the Aryan Nations ''National Congress 2001'' would be planned for a site near Ulysses, Pa. Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler declined to talk with reporters Friday.
He is appealing the judgment to the Idaho Supreme Court, but that appeal is not expected to halt the seizure of the group's 20-acre compound north of Hayden Lake.
Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs' legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.
Butler moved to northern Idaho from California in 1973, and began holding an annual event called the Aryan Nations Congress in 1981.
The gatherings drew white supremacists from across the nation to hear speeches and participate in cross burnings and other activities.
Kootenai County Sheriff Rocky Watson has said his officers will seize the Aryan Nations compound on Sept. 29.
The sheriff's office will store the contents and eventually hold a sale, with the money going to Victoria and Jason Keenan, who filed the lawsuit, and their lawyers.
Last week, a jury ruled that Butler, his organization and its corporate entity, Saphire Inc., were negligent in selecting and overseeing security guards who attacked the Keenans in 1998.
