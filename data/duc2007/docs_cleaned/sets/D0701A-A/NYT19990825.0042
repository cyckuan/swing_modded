By BILL MAXWELL Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel ``The Turner Diaries,'' much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists.
Now, with increasing numbers of white males targeting and gunning down members of minority groups, Dees' failed book-banning campaign although still unreasonable to most Americans, myself included, on First Amendment grounds is not as unpalatable as it once was.
The reason is that ``The Turner Diaries'' serves as a bible for killers such as Tim McVeigh and Ben Smith and L.A. day camp shooting suspect Buford Furrow.
Published in 1978 and set in the 1990s, the novel depicts Armageddon between select whites and everyone else blacks, Jews, government officials, journalists, cops, military personnel.
At this time, called the ``Day of the Rope,'' tens of thousands of blacks and Jews are exterminated.
This also is when the ``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms of compassion.
Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts and, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''
Even more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have read it.
The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers a glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for inspiration: ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.
Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile.
It is the world view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge, pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''
```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out during the last three decades of the Old Era.
Women affected by it denied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not `women.'''
``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan outlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to Jewish spiritual corruption.''
``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and resentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are really at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to behold.''
``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every neighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out the majority of the population and reorienting their thinking.
In fact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary.
The people require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of thought.''
``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning.
We must look at our situation collectively, in a race-wide sense.
We must understand that our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery in order to save his life.
There is no sense in asking whether the tissue being cut out is `innocent' or not.
That is no more reasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad ones or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still insist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of their race.''
``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the last of Satan's spawn.''
After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons, the ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It no longer sufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one to be judged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''
After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald, who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in Oregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner Diaries.'''
An understatement, for sure.
As head of the Neo-Nazi National Alliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide, Pierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls ``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the Hillboro, W.Va., headquarters.
There, the future stalwarts, who mistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art of hatred.
The main training manual?
``The Turner Diaries.''
Besides these 100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many others, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own way and re-enact its graphic mayhem.
