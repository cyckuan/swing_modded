The conviction of white supremacist John William King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man, begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's history of race relations.
But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial, as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrates.
According to the report, the number of hate groups in the country increased again last year.
Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our society's fabric.
They give rise to the environment that fostered King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own in Jasper, Texas.
Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison inmate.
In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed in the blood of the Jews.''
The scary thing is that King is only 24.
He didn't evolve overnight into the monster that killed Byrd.
Neither did his moral moorings come loose in a vacuum.
King's hate steadily was fed, tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head: a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with horns; Nazi symbols.
Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how King might have arrived at this point.
In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
And in Virginia Beach, Va., a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate flag belt buckle.
The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave his buckle at home.
While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to humanity.
For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other separatist organizations.
And, make no mistake, they're hungry for more recruits.
Their new tool, according to the law center, is the Internet.
Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997.
The Southern Poverty Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups from 1996 to 1997.
Take a good look.
This is how John William King learned to hate.
Right under our noses.
In our back yard.
``(It's) something that is a virus,'' Jasper County District Attorney James Gray told jurors in closing arguments last week.
``It's something that's dangerous.
It's something that spreads from one person to another.''
But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by challenging those who espouse it.
Byrd's murder is all the motivation we need.
