The 600-page report on the 1993 murder of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution in race relations.
The report makes damning criticisms of the metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first time in Britain, institutional racism.
It calls for widespread reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed problem in modern British society.
The investigation was so marred from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably never be punished.
Indonesia nine months after the fall of Suharto, and the prospects for the June general election.

The 21st century is drawing near, but in Calcutta, the most vital mode of transportation is still the rickshaw.
Although most are now pulled by cycle, manually-pulled ones are still prevalent in poorer and more congested neighborhoods.
The average rickshaw puller wakes at dawn and pulls his buggy like a human beast of burden till sundown.

At the end of the 20th century, America's dilemma is still the same as it was when the century dawned - the ``color line,'' in the famous words of W.E.B.
Dubois.
But what of the next 100 years?
If current trends continue, what will be the standing of African Americans at the end of the 21st century?
Displaced by Hispanics as the largest ethnic group - and voting bloc - will they have the political clout to make demands?
Or will there, in fact, be any reason for demands, assuming America finally does become color blind?
The changing racial face of America; how teen and adult attitudes toward race relations differ.
The battle lines are forming in the contest for the Republican Party's 2000 presidential election.
Some strategists, handlers, fund raisers and advertising executives are choosing up sides, but some are content to watch as the two front-runners, George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole, hold off on formally becoming candidates.
President Clinton's complex funding plan to save Social Security is an ineffective fraud, Republicans charge.
Democrats insist the plan will work, but acknowledge that making it understandable to average voters is a tough task.
We take our shot.
Can an 1890s anti-trust law be flexible and youthful enough to govern a rapidly morphing technology industry?
We look at some of the possible scenarios coming out of the Microsoft trial, including possible remedies, and whether any of this can build a governmental framework around a changeling industry.
Sam Nunn and Newt Gingrich looked out for Georgia, and while the state's 13 members of Congress are every bit as vigilant, they lack the clout of the onetime chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Speaker of the House.
The Georgia delegation is scrambling on several fronts to minimize the damage from Gingrich's resignation, which followed Nunn's retirement by two years.
The 106th Congress may not be as kind to Georgia as its predecessors.

The Rev.
Ron Foshage was a consoler in the courtroom all through the dreadful trial that appalled America.
The Catholic priest was a familiar sight at the Jasper County courthouse because he volunteered to sit with the ailing father of the white racist on trial for dragging a black man to death.
His role was one of the most difficult he's ever had to face.
(Gamino, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED HATEGROUPS MANNING, S.C. An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could carry him.
Three days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of the Macedonia Baptist Church.
By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of fire churned from the middle of the church.
Before sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of 400 other black churches burned from 1993 to 1996.
So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy.
But since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill.
Now in his legal firing line is the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group in Idaho.

Here's a great idea for gun manufacturers, though they won't think so right away: Their industry should start thinking about supporting national gun control.
No, really.
Any thought that the slightly larger paychecks Congress approved for our military is going to get a person to join is to miss the real point of why so many are declining to remain: Someone could get killed out there.
The U.S. has become unbridled in its use of U.S. troops around the world.
In ramping up for his coming presidential race, Al Gore has sent a two-page letter more than 100,000 people, inviting them to become members of his ``National Steering Committee'' a group that will never meet and has no formal duties.
From the ground, he still looks like a Roman god.
Vulcan, billed as the world's largest cast-iron statue, ripples with bronzed metallic muscles as he looms atop Red Mountain.
But if you climb his 123-foot pedestal and stand in the pigeon poop around his sandaled feet, it's obvious that the man of iron isn't in peak condition these days.
His ankles are rusting.
Lime leaches down his calves.
Water drips embarrassingly from his crotch.
``Vulcan is like a lot of people you meet in bars,'' says local deejay Guy ``Beaner'' Patton, ``better looking from a distance.''
