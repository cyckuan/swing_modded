An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could carry him.
Two days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of Macedonia Baptist Church.
No one would torch a house of God, not even the Klan, Mouzon thought.
By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of fire swirled from the middle of the church roof.
Before sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American church fires investigated in the South since 1995.
An uneasiness prevailed.
``You were constantly looking over your shoulder,'' said Mouzon, a shift supervisor for a security company.
So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy.
Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill.
He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank account.
Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group in Idaho.
On Jan. 25, the Montgomery, Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi members.
The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the Klan: seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard Butler.
Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a group he said recruited throughout the Carolinas.
Eventually, leaders of the Christian Knights were convicted of civil conspiracy inciting the fire that destroyed Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21, 1995.
By the next summer, Macedonia stood again.
Tucked away in one of South Carolina's poorest counties, the church took out a $100,000 loan, built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for the first time in Mouzon's 13 years as pastor.
Dees said he could win a multimillion-dollar civil judgment that would put the South Carolina Klan out of business.
Dees explained how he had won money damages against the Klan before one for $7 million in Mobile, Ala., another for $1 million in Forsyth County, Ga.
He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from Klan intimidation.
``He was not this enormous person that you read about.
He was one of you,'' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church, its floors covered by carpet as red as Santa's suit.
Macedonia signed on.
As he does in all his cases, Dees charged the church nothing.
Last summer, his litigators and investigators secured a $37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan.
Even after a court reduced the damages to $20 million, it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed against a hate group.
The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the dollar for every successful civil judgment.
All money realized from settlements is given to the victims.
What the lawsuits have done, even some Klan leaders have conceded, is make extremist activity a bad investment, diminishing the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups.
In most of the cases pursued by Dees, the defendants also have lost what little property they held.
To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders, Dees told them about Beulah Mae Donald, the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael Donald, who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981.
Then 64, the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United Klans of America.
She wanted neither vengeance nor money.
She wanted justice for Michael.
Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan.
Bank records showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30 states.
Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters in Tuscaloosa.
Former Klan members testified that UKA President Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks.
The conspiracy trial lasted four days.
An all-white jury of six found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $7 million to Beulah Mae Donald.
The UKA as a machine of hatred had been shut down.
``The Klan of yesteryear is dead,'' Shelton said in a 1995 interview.
``Society's changing.
You can't have parades with Klansmen in robes anymore.
The public won't go along with it.
The Klan is gone.
It will never return.''
Donald received the deed to the Klan faction's $125,000 Tuscaloosa headquarters the closest she ever got to the $7 million awarded by the jury.
She sold the property for half its appraised value and bought her first house.
Donald died in 1988, a year after the trial.
Using civil suits, the Southern Poverty Law Center seizes whatever assets the targeted hate group owns although it never amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines.
In military terms, Dees goes after command and control centers.
Mouzon's church eventually may get only $200,000, if that, the law center said, from the Christian Knights and Horace King, the South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of the Macedonia Baptist Church.
That's only a penny on the dollar.
But it will put King on the street and, theoretically, the Klan out of business.
Hate groups are paying attention to Dees' tactics.
One white supremacist group, fearful of being sued by Dees, transferred its assets to another organization.
The advice: disband immediately.
``The Klan will always be around under one name or another,'' the newsletter said.
``Don't appeal for defense funds.
Close your bank accounts.
Forget about lawyers.''
But proving organized hate isn't as easy as showing pictures of flaming crosses to a jury.
Newsletters, and Web sites stewing in fiery rhetoric aren't enough for conviction.
The convincing tie-in comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan, linking rhetoric to violence.
In the case of King, the South Carolina grand dragon, the law center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in Washington.
In the tape, shown to jurors, King talks about blacks and yells, ``If we had this garbage in South Carolina, we would burn the bastards out!''
On top of that, Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to burn black churches.
King postponed one church fire, fearing the Klan would be suspected.
King's attorney, Gary White of Columbia, S.C., relied on a First Amendment defense: Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected free speech.
``That's not an easy pitch to a jury,'' White said.
``It was ugly and inflammatory, but that's what the First Amendment is all about.''
White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only ``a couple of acres and a small, run-down house on it.''
However, Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot soldiers.
``The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not the kind of thing he would just shrug off,'' Cohen said.
``That's the kind of thing that has a lasting impact.
When you're going off to the Klan rally and you're saying goodbye to your wife, she's not real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these people you may lose your home.''
Tactics questioned Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut conspiracies costs a bundle.
Dees estimates the Manning investigation cost nearly $100,000 $500,000 if attorney time had been charged.
Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising.
From 1992 to 1997, it raised $102 million, according to its federal tax filings.
Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came from more than 300,000 private contributors.
During the same time, the group spent $15 million on fund-raising more than 22 cents of every dollar consumed by total expenses.
In 1974, the law center started with an endowment of $72,775.
Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses.
In 1997, the endowment topped $90 million $89.6 million of it invested in equity securities.
The organization's net assets exceeded $97 million.
Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which was once pastored by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., the law center will begin construction next month of a $10 million, six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters.
Dees drew a $205,339 salary in 1996 as the center's chief trial counsel and chairman of its executive committee.
He contributed $19,458 to the employee benefit plan, according to the center's 1996 federal tax form.
Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for South Carolina attorney general last November, helped Dees get in touch with Macedonia Baptist Church.
``Morris loves to raise money,'' said Turnipseed, a distant relative of Dees'.
``Some of his gimmicks are just so transparent but they're good.
He knows how to get people to give him the money.''
In a recent fund-raising letter, Turnipseed said, his return envelope came with ``about six different stamps.
It was like they had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents.''
Smaller civil rights groups, like the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta, which started as the Anti-Klan Network, wonder why the law center needs so much money.
``It appears they're just sitting on it.
The community doesn't see the product,'' said Chris Freeman, a Center for Democratic Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery group.
``But the question is: Where are the funds going?
Their research is geared to groups like us, but there's nothing in the com- munity.''
The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders, who lob their bombast in newsletters and on the Internet.
Tom Metzger, head of the White Aryan Resistance, lost a $12.5 million suit in 1990 to Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant.
He pays $845 a month to the victim's estate.
Less than affectionately, Metzger calls his nemesis ``Morris Sleaze.''
``Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due,'' Metzger once wrote.
``He has compiled the largest direct mail financial sucker list in the country.''
The core of the law center's program is ``Teaching Tolerance,'' a classroom program started in 1991.
The program features books, videos and posters costing up to $30 each.
The law center also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights litigation program in Georgia.
The program is designed to stem federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal assistance to poor people in civil actions.
Mouzon, the Macedonia pastor, said he doesn't begrudge the law center one cent.
``Not at all,'' he said, ``because we know firsthand what they do.
He knew we didn't have any money to accept representation.''
As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young's Country Mart near Manning, pallet makers from a nearby mill buy quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter.
``Maybe a few of them graduated from high school,'' said Jesse Young, a trustee at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the convenience store.
One of the regulars is Romeo Haley.
His brother is Arthur, a Klansman who testified against the real big shots Horace King and Virgil Griffin, the main defendants in the Macedonia fire.
Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders, Romeo Haley says race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit.
Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan.''
Haley said he ``never had no use'' for the Klan.
``They're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause,'' he said.
``They're fed up with the federal government, but they'll get scared and run in a minute.
There are people who planted the tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit, they ran.''
Since the civil verdict, a healing spirit has touched Macedonia.
Mouzon plans a church picnic for his country community.
Timothy Welch, one of those convicted for setting the blaze, grew up in the area, climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing with church members' kids.
Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown to hate him.
Welch's mother, Wanda, has attended recent Sunday services.
Each time, she apologized to the congregation.
But there's no need, Mouzon said.
All is forgiven.
``We're trying to move past it,'' he said.
``It comes up occasionally.
But we're trying to forget.''
The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have assets totaling around $100 million.
But the civil rights organization still spends most of its money on programs to help poor people.
