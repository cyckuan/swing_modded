Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich will try to reach a divorce settlement today in their first face-to-face meeting since theirsplit.
The couple is scheduled to appear for a court-ordered mediation session in Cobb County, Ga.
The meeting will be held at the offices of Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
An agreement today may be a lot to ask, however.
Marianne Gingrich has yet to question under oath her estranged husband's admitted girlfriend, Callista Bisek.
Marianne Gingrich and Mayoue have considered the deposition a key element of their case.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
Last month, a Washington judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under oath for Marianne Gingrich and provide documents related to her affair with Gingrich.
The documents include cards, phone records and bank statements dating back to 1995, when Newt Gingrich became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Gingrich and Bisek, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, have admitted they've been seeing each other for six years.
Bisek has begun turning over the documents to Marianne Gingrich, but the two sides have been unable to agree on a deposition date.
It's uncertain now whether Bisek's deposition will be taken at all this month.
Mayoue said he needs time to examine Bisek's documents, although he originally demanded only that Bisek bring the documents to the deposition.
Mayoue has not returned phone messages left at his office for more than a week.
Evans said this week that Gingrich is prepared to split the couple's marital assets and pay his wife alimony.
He said he wasn't sure whether a settlement could actually be reached today, but he said Gingrich is going into the mediation with an open mind.
The Gingriches elected to use a mediator chosen by the court's Alternative Dispute Resolution division, so there would be no complaints later about how a mediator was selected.
After today's session, the mediator will report to the court whether the Gingriches have hit an impasse, reached a settlement or made progress toward a divorce agreement.
Said Evans: ``I would be surprised if the judge didn't order at least one more mediation session before it goes to trial.''
