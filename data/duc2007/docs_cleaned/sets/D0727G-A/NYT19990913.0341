The Gingriches have reached a confidential agreement on how to divide their income and assets while their legal separation proceeds, avoiding an open and potentially contentious hearing this week.
``It gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney and longtime friend.
An assets hearing scheduled for Thursday before Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson is now unnecessary, Evans said.
But by late Monday the judge hadn't canceled what was to be a first joint appearance in court by the Gingriches.
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, confirmed that an agreement was reached, but would give no details.
The agreement is a sign that the Gingriches are willing to compromise to keep their private lives out of public view.
The Thursday hearing was expected to attract national media, whose reporting has been stoked by Newt Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing the former U.S. House speaker of attempting to transfer ``certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
``There was never any truth to that, so there was nothing to resolve,'' Evans said.
Newt Gingrich, 56, retaliated with his own court filing, saying his wife of 18 years held all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated.
He further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those assets.
The former 10-term congressman from Marietta, Ga., also submitted a 1987 separation agreement that paid Marianne Gingrich $12,000 in alimony over six months, and divided the couple's bank accounts, furniture and cars.
Newt Gingrich asked the judge to determine whether the agreement was still technically in effect, or whether the couple could structure a new separation agreement along the same lines.
Another Newt Gingrich attorney, Thomas Browning, said the Gingriches had maintained separate residences for six years before reconciling about late 1993.
That news took Washington insiders and Gingrich supporters at home by surprise.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, has admitted in the past that there was a separation years ago but has declined to say how long it lasted.
``I'm disappointed that Newt Gingrich has chosen such a hurtful strategy,'' said Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, before Monday's agreement, ``especially considering his very public conduct that's at the heart of this action.''
