On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in the former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
Cobb County Judge Dorothy Robinson made the Gingriches' divorce final and agreed to seal the agreement, which they signed early this week.
By doing so, the Gingriches spared themselves any embarrassment that could have come from trying their case in public.
``It's over,'' said Tom Browning, an attorney for Newt Gingrich, who was not present at Thursday's hearing.
Standing outside the courthouse after the hearing, Marianne Ginther Gingrich, 48, added that she will keep her ex-husband's last name.
``Most people know me by that name,'' she said.
``We've been married a very long time.''
Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce July 29.
The couple and their attorneys spent nearly the next five months arguing over depositions and money, going to court twice.
But on Dec. 16, during a court-ordered mediation that ended after 12 hours, the Gingriches reached a tentative agreement.
The couple's attorneys took another three months to work out the details.
Thursday's short and relatively quiet hearing was in stark contrast to the posturing by both sides early on.
In his July divorce petition, Newt Gingrich said the marriage was ``irretrievably broken,'' a standard clause under Georgia's ``no fault'' divorce laws.
In her answer, Marianne Gingrich denied the claim, offering no explanation for why.
And she still won't say.
On Thursday, Marianne Gingrich told the judge that the marriage was indeed ``irretrievably broken.''
Here's what else the public likely will never know: Whether Newt Gingrich tried to transfer ``certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce, as Marianne Gingrich alleged.
The details of Newt Gingrich's affair with Callista Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, and how he carried it on without Marianne Gingrich's knowledge.
Bisek was ordered to sit for a deposition with Marianne Gingrich's lawyers, but the case was settled before that happened.
What the couple's associates would have to say about the marriage and Gingrich's affair.
Newt Gingrich won permission to depose Marianne Gingrich's sister and a friend, both in Ohio.
Marianne Gingrich won permission to depose members of her husband's political and business associates, including his self-described closest adviser, Joe Gaylord.
None of those depositions occurred.
And what Newt Gingrich earns.
That information is sealed away in the settlement.
Since resigning as speaker and from the congressional seat he held for 20 years, Gingrich has been making a living giving speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst on Fox News.
Marianne Gingrich plans to continue her work with the Red Cross and various charity groups.
She indicated Thursday that she is evaluating several business opportunities as well, but would not elaborate.
