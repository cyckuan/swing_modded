In a notice filed Tuesday in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich announced he will question Callista Bisek under oath Nov. 9.
The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together since the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives filed for divorce in July.
The move, which an opposing attorney called ``unique,'' comes weeks into an unresolved legal contest between Bisek and Marianne Gingrich over the same deposition.
Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with the former speaker.
The subpoena also asks for documents, such as letters, phone records and gift receipts, that could link the two romantically.
The judge's ruling is expected any day.
``This whole idea of us hiding the ball, I want to get rid of that real quick,'' Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Tuesday.
``We're not hiding anything.''
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, characterized Gingrich's deposition notice as ``peculiar'' and pointed out that Bisek has not withdrawn her objections to Mayoue's request for a deposition.
While Bisek could conceivably object to questioning by Gingrich's attorneys, Evans said she has agreed to participate.
In fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in Washington, according to Tuesday's filing.
Bisek's attorney, Pamela Bresnahan, did not return a phone message seeking confirmation.
Gingrich's notice also instructs Bisek to bring with her records of any money he has spent on her, gifts he's purchased for her, and travel she's taken at his expense since he became speaker.
They are all documents Bisek already has agreed to turn over in the deposition dispute between her and Marianne Gingrich.
According to divorce experts, Gingrich wants to make it clear to the public and to the court that Bisek is an independent witness who is not under his control.
``They are trying to show the court that they are not trying to hide her,'' Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin said.
Other than as a public relations tool, Gingrich's move to depose Bisek offers little tactical benefit, Edlin said.
In a deposition, both sides are allowed to question the witness.
While Evans has scheduled Bisek's deposition for Nov. 9, his notice left open the possibility that a new date could be negotiated.
On Nov. 11, the Gingriches are due to appear before Judge Dorothy Robinson in Cobb Superior Court as their lawyers argue several discovery motions still in contention.
Both sides say they intend to follow through with the hearing.
Said Evans: ``We want to get this case resolved or tried.''
