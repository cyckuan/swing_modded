Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich spent Thursday afternoon with a mediator in their first attempt to resolve their bitter divorce.
It was unclear whether they were making any real progress.
For at least the first two hours of the court-ordered session, the Gingriches remained in separate rooms.
``Each party is in a conference room, and the mediator goes back and forth between each group,'' said Tom Browning, Newt Gingrich's divorce attorney.
But Browning said mediation generally includes a face-to-face meeting at some point.
Asked if the split would be settled Thursday, Browning said he was hopeful: ``You know, it's to their benefit.
Those who are able to settle their cases are going to save a lot of money.''
John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, also offered few hints about the mediation, which was being conducted in his law offices near Cumberland Mall in Cobb County.
``It's an extraordinarily complex and difficult case.
It's fraught with a lot of emotions,'' Mayoue said.
``We're using our best efforts today to get this matter resolved.''
Mediation is required of most civil cases in Cobb County Superior Court, where Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
The couple has been married 18 years.
Newt Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans, said the former U.S. House speaker is ready to split all current assets with his wife and pay her alimony.
Marianne Gingrich hasn't said what her terms for settlement would be.
But she has been adamant about deposing Callista Bisek, the House employee with whom Gingrich has had a relationship for six years.
That deposition probably will be put off until early next year.
The Gingrich divorce so far has included a number of smaller fights over money, information and the testimony of Bisek.
The couple nearly went to court over a joint account set up to protect their assets while the divorce is being sought.
Much of the money was earned this year, after Gingrich left Congress in January.
That dispute settled on whether Marianne Gingrich had deposited all the funds from a joint company the couple had set up this year before their split.
On Nov. 9, Marianne Gingrich took her husband's lawyers to a Cobb County courtroom and successfully asked a judge to order him to answer 32 questions intended to dig up evidence about finances and infidelity.
On Nov. 23, Marianne Gingrich again went to court, this time in Washington.
There, a judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under oath and provide records that might document her relationship with Gingrich.
