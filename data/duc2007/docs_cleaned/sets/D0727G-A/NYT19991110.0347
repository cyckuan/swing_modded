Attorneys for Gingrich say he will skip today's hearing.
His estranged wife, Marianne, plans to attend.
Marianne Gingrich has asked Judge Dorothy Robinson to force Gingrich to answer pages of questions designed to uncover evidence that can be used at trial.
Most of the questions concern the former U.S. House speaker's finances and his admitted affair with Callista Bisek, 33, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee in Washington.
Gingrich contends his wife's multiple-part questions actually amount to as many as 150 questions.
Georgia law allows just one-third that many, so Gingrich wants his wife to pare them down.
The contentious divorce has been full of unusual turns, including Gingrich's deposition Tuesday in Virginia of Bisek, who admitted the two have carried on a six-year affair.
Such moves have left divorce attorneys outside the case shaking their heads.
Meanwhile, Bisek has refused to answer a Washington subpoena that requires her to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney.
The subpoena also requires Bisek to produce gifts and other documents that evidence her affair with Gingrich.
Washington judge will decide that dispute after a Nov. 23 hearing.
Gingrich filed for divorce in July, just days before the couple's 18th wedding anniversary.
Months earlier, Gingrich had called his wife at her childhood home in Ohio to say he wanted out of the marriage and that he was having an affair with Bisek.
