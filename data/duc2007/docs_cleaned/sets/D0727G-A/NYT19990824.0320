In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has already transferred.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances.''
Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug. 9 in Cobb Superior Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is accused of attempting to transfer.
Her attorney, John Mayoue, declined to elaborate on the filing.
Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept. 16.
The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after 1998 GOP election losses.
In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and business dealings.
Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of marriage.
Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va., with whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a video-taped deposition of Bisek.
Mayoue has said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.
