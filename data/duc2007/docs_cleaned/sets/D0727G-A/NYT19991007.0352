Newt Gingrich wants to know whether his estranged wife put him under surveillance shortly before he became speaker of the U.S. House.
And it turns out the former Georgia congressman no longer has a house to call home in Cobb County, at least for a while.
The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened trial date.
In one of the more significant developments of the day, a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56.
Bisek is an aide to the House Agriculture Committee.
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge ordered the attorneys for Bisek and Marianne Gingrich to meet by next Friday to discuss a subpoena ordering Bisek to be deposed and to produce a wide range of evidence.
The items include letters, gifts, phone records and other items Marianne Gingrich could use to prove Bisek was having an extramarital affair with her husband.
Bisek has asked the judge to block the subpoena, saying it was issued incorrectly and is too vague.
Bisek also argues that she is being asked to incriminate herself.
Adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia.
Hedge ruled Thursday that the subpoena was procedurally sound, but the Washington judge wants the attorneys to agree on the scope of the information that can be demanded of Bisek.
In Cobb County, Gingrich has asked his wife to respond to 26 questions and demands for discovery evidence by Wednesday, so his attorneys can prepare for a deposition of Marianne Gingrich scheduled for Oct. 19.
Most of Gingrich's questions are an attempt to learn everything possible about the financial standing of his wife, who controlled the couple's assets.
And in most cases, Gingrich seeks financial documents dating back to 1987, when the couple signed a separation agreement splitting their possessions during a spat Gingrich says lasted six years.
Other questions in Gingrich's discovery notice seek to learn about any marital improprieties on his wife's part.
Still others seek to know what, if anything, she has learned about Gingrich's personal life.
One demand by Gingrich reads: ``Copies of any surveillance or investigation reports, notes, or memos from 1994 to the date of trial.''
This type of question is not uncommon in hard-fought divorce cases, where spouses often hire detectives to sniff out everything from finances to affairs, said Washington divorce lawyer Sanford Ain.
``It's almost always asked when infidelity is an issue,'' he said.
Thursday also brought the public release of a Sept. 10 temporary agreement the Gingriches signed splitting and securing their assets while they litigate their divorce.
The agreement gives Marianne Gingrich possession of the couple's Marietta, Ga., home.
Gingrich, who served metro Atlanta's 6th Congressional District from Marietta for six of his 20 years in office, will live in the couple's Washington apartment.
The agreement also pays the Gingriches a monthly stipend of $10,000 each.
That represents an annual combined income of at least $240,000.
Exactly how much money is at stake between the Gingriches is uncertain.
Even they are trying to figure that one, according to court records.
