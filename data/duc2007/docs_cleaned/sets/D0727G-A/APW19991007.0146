Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is asking a judge to force his estranged wife to turn over money he says she is hoarding.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days.
It threatens a contempt action if she refuses.
The couple agreed last month to set up the joint account and transfer assets into it until their divorce is final.
Evans said he believes Mrs. Gingrich still owes the account tens of thousands of dollars.
Gingrich has turned over about $35,000, while Mrs. Gingrich has turned over only several thousand, he said.
Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, has denied the allegations.
Harvey Cohen, the accountant hired to manage the joint account, said he was not aware of any improprieties by either party.
Wednesday's motion was one of a series filed by Gingrich this week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has sought to force him to face formal questioning about his personal and financial affairs.
Mrs. Gingrich also wants to question Callista Bisek, a congressional aide to whom Gingrich has been romantically linked.
Gingrich separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed for divorce in July.
