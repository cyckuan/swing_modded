Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge is set to hear arguments this morning about what gifts, records and other documents Gingrich's girlfriend, Callista Bisek, must turn over in his Cobb County, Ga., divorce.
Many of the records requested by Gingrich's wife, Marianne, date back to January 1995, when Gingrich was sworn in a speaker of the U.S. House.
Hedge also must decide how soon Bisek, a Virginia resident and scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, will have to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney.
They have asked that a deposition be held within 30 days.
Marianne Gingrich says she'll attend the hearing.
Efforts to contact Bisek and her attorney have been unsuccessful.
Today's hearing is significant because Marianne Gingrich, 48, and her attorney appear intent on taking Bisek's deposition before they will talk settlement.
The Bisek deposition is among several disputes that have marked the contentious case since the twice-married Newt Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
Gingrich and Marianne have been married 18 years.
Bisek, a scheduler for the Agriculture Committee, has already testified under oath for Gingrich's attorneys that her affair with the former Georgia congressman began six years ago.
Attorneys for Gingrich, 56, also have admitted that he had an ``intimate relationship'' with Bisek, 33.
However, Bisek still refuses to answer Marianne Gingrich's questions under oath or respond to certain document requests.
Both areas could contain evidence that might be used during a divorce trial or to leverage a more favorable settlement.
Bisek has argued that many of Marianne Gingrich's questions are either too broad or vague.
Bisek has also expressed concerns that some of the questions infringe upon her constitutional right not to incriminate herself.
Adultery is a crime in Washington.
Last month, Hedge ordered lawyers for the Gingriches to try to reach a compromise on the subpoena.
While they agreed on certain items, they reached an impasse on others.
Bisek has agreed to reveal several gifts Gingrich gave her, including a pearl ring and a set of Callaway Golf clubs.
Bisek also is prepared to reveal money Gingrich has spent on her, or trips she's taken at his expense.
There's much more Bisek still refuses to turn over, including phone records for the past five years, correspondence between her and Gingrich, as well as photos, videotapes or audiotapes of them together.
