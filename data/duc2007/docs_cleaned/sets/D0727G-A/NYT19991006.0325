As promised, Newt Gingrich kept the pressure on his estranged wife Wednesday by asking a judge to force her to turn over money he says she's hoarding.
In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final.
The motion threatens a contempt action if Marianne Gingrich continues to stall.
Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich still owes the joint account tens of thousands of dollars, by his estimation.
So far she has deposited only several thousand, Evans said.
Gingrich, who has signed a sworn statement saying his wife controls most of their money, has turned over about $35,000 he has been paid for sitting on several boards.
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but he has previously denied the allegations.
The CPA managing the account for the Gingriches said both sides have acted in good faith.
Wednesday's motion was among several filed by Gingrich this week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has aggressively sought to question him about personal and financial matters outside their marriage.
Marianne Gingrich also wants to depose Callista Bisek, a congressional aide with whom the former U.S. House speaker has a relationship.
Evans said Gingrich's new attack stance will continue through the week.
Coming motions will probe financial aspects of the divorce case.
Next week, Gingrich's motions will focus on what part Marianne Gingrich played in the breakdown of the marriage.
``It is going to be a most enlightening week,'' Evans predicted.
Gingrich's latest motion centers on a Sept. 10 agreement he and his wife signed that was supposed to temporarily resolve monetary issues between the divorcing couple.
Marianne Gingrich had accused her husband of attempting to transfer money before filing his July 29 divorce petition.
Gingrich had responded by saying his wife depleted a substantial portion of the accounts she controlled.
According to the ensuing agreement, ``All existing amounts as well as any accumulated compensation earned since the parties' separation, irrespective of location, in any account of any kind ... shall be transferred immediately into the account.''
Gingrich's motion accuses Marianne Gingrich of waiting 20 days to begin transferring her portion of the assets.
Cohen, the CPA managing the joint account, says some of Gingrich's speech money is still tied up in a business he and his wife own together.
Cohen expects to get that money once the necessary transfer paperwork is completed.
