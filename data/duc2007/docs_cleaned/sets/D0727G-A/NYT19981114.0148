The walks, which became less frequent with his rise to power, helped relieve bouts of early morning depression.
Last week, Gingrich left his office twice to walk the Mall, once with a close aide and once with his wife, Marianne.
The walks, he said, were dedicated to thinking about ``the future, thinking about how I'm going to organize my life for the next year.''
Gingrich, 55, is already moving on.
He remains on the job until the new Congress formally elects a new speaker Jan. 6.
But Gingrich already has become speaker in name only.
This past week, beginning with his return to Washington after the Nov. 3 elections and ending with an address to new members, was effectively his last in power.
Gingrich's power began slipping the instant he announced 10 days ago that he would not stand for re-election as speaker and would resign the House seat he has held since 1979.
By the time Gingrich arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday to a bittersweet welcome party organized by staff, House Republicans already had shifted their allegiance to Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.
Staff members proclaimed their affection with posters saying, ``I love Newt.''
Across America, the post-election issue of Newsweek hit newsstands, featuring a vaguely anguished close-up of Gingrich and captioned simply, ``The Loser.''
The speed at which power shifts in Washington is both breathtaking and cruel.
In Livingston's office adjacent to the Capitol, it was standing room only as reporters, lobbyists and staff competed to get Livingston's attention.
Members trying to reach Livingston by phone got constant busy signals and were forced to walk to his office to get through.
Livingston emerged from a meeting with Gingrich Tuesday afternoon, noting there were ``just a jillion tasks, a jillion things to do.''
In contrast, Gingrich's office was quiet most of the week.
Inquiries to Gingrich's press office, which typically average 100 to 150 calls a day, dropped to fewer than 30.
There were no events to plan, no agenda to set.
Gingrich himself was busy planning his private, not public, life.
``It's the reality of this town,'' said Robert Walker, a former House member from Pennsylvania and a close friend of Gingrich's.
``This town flows toward power.''
Strategy for a new life For Gingrich, the emotional high of last week may have been Monday night when he addressed the biggest contributors of GOPAC, the political action committee he once led and the vehicle of his accession to power.
The ovations were frequent and thunderous, even though the remarks themselves were little changed from his stock campaign speech.
Gingrich seemed as if a ``great burden had been lifted from his shoulders,'' said Matt Glavin, director of the Southeastern Legal Foundation in Atlanta, who spoke to Gingrich the night he announced that he would not run for speaker and who was present at the Monday dinner speech.
The defining moment of the evening came not from what Gingrich said, but from what he did.
Before the speech, he embraced Livingston warmly, conferring his blessing on the next speaker for all to see.
By Tuesday, Gingrich's staff member were already adjusting to their new roles.
Gingrich himself set the tone, coming in to work after lunch with Marianne and daughters Jackie Sue Cushman and Kathy Gingrich-Lubbers at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a Washington institution near the White House.
Gingrich padded around his office, appearing unhurried and relaxed.
Midafternoon he bumped into Casey Weldon, the third-string quarterback for the Washington Redskins, who was getting a tour of the Capitol.
The Redskins, 1-8 for the season, are having their most disastrous year of the decade.
``He told me to hang in there, that it's been a rough year for all of us,'' Weldon said.
Later, Gingrich met with Livingston for more than an hour, the first formal meeting between the two men since Livingston announced he would run for speaker the Friday after the elections.
``He just couldn't be more gracious and helpful,'' Livingston said.
Gingrich was already ``strategizing his life.''
``Newt Gingrich doesn't think small thoughts,'' Livingston said.
``He thinks large and wide.
He's an incredibly gifted person.''
Marianne popped in and out of Gingrich's office all day Tuesday, appearing positively serene.
``Changes occur,'' she said.
``You say, `OK, what next?'
We weren't expecting this, but now this is an opportunity.''
Walker, who Gingrich once hoped would be his majority whip instead of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), ate dinner with the Gingriches Wednesday night at the Capital Grille, another Washington institution.
``This is going to give them an opportunity to plan their lives together in ways that are going to be wonderful.''
Although Gingrich hasn't said specifically what he will do when he leaves office, Walker and others are betting that he will take his place on the lucrative lecture circuit.
The occupation will continue to give Gingrich visibility, and allow him to discuss ideas without the chore of trying to translate them into legislation.
``He'll be one of the hottest names on the lecture circuit for some time to come,'' Walker said.
King of a different hill Mel Steely, an old buddy of Gingrich's from West Georgia College, dropped in to see the speaker last week and also wasn't surprised to find Gingrich in good spirits.
``He's still king of the hill, it's just a different hill,'' Steely said.
``In Newt's mind, he's always king of the hill.
That's what you guys don't understand about him.''
On Wednesday, Gingrich received some retirement advice from former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
``He'll be around a while,'' Dole said, leaving Gingrich's office.
``At 55, he's got a lot ahead of him.''
While Gingrich wasn't getting much attention inside the Capitol last week, outside the building was a different story.
When he took his late afternoon walk around the Mall Wednesday with Steve Wesbrook, his operations manager, Gingrich was recognized by virtually everyone.
Striding past the National Gallery of Art, Gingrich shook the outstretched hand of a tourist who said, ``Nice to see you, Mr.
Speaker.''
Out of Gingrich's earshot, an associate of the tourist turned to his walking partner and said, ``Nice to see you?
Nice to see you go!''
More typical was the response of Joe Domenico, who wanted his picture taken with Gingrich.
``Thank you for everything,'' Domenico said.
At the Lincoln Memorial, Gingrich was nearly tackled by a breathless student from the University of Maryland who said she was studying Gingrich in college.
Holding a copy of ``To Renew America,'' Gingrich's 1995 book, the woman begged Gingrich to sign it.
``This is a library book,'' Gingrich exclaimed.
``I'm going to buy it from them.''
``Now Rebekah, you have to buy this book,'' Gingrich said after signing it.
Gingrich walked the Mall again Thursday, this time with Marianne.
Holding hands, fewer people seemed to notice the speaker, who was dressed in black slacks, white shoes and brown leather jacket.
``Good luck, Newt!''
Before he returned to Georgia on Friday, Gingrich performed perhaps his most meaningful official duty of the week, giving the opening greeting to the 40 newly elected members of the House at freshmen orientation.
Prior to the official welcome, Gingrich breakfasted with the freshmen members in the ``family room,'' a large wood-paneled room just off the House floor reserved for members and their guests.
At the breakfast, Gingrich told the new members that service in the House was a strain on home life, and he urged them to make a special effort to spend time with their families.
He told them that House service was an honor, but that they should also have fun.
Illinois state Rep. Judy Biggert, a Republican elected from the Chicago suburbs, recalled how Gingrich had come to her district before the election and energized her supporters ``by what he had to say.''
Gingrich's remarks Friday were inspirational, Biggert said, but different.
``It was kind of bittersweet,'' she said as she hurried into her first orientation meeting.
