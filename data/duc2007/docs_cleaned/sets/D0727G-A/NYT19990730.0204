Gingrich filed papers Thursday in the Superior Court of Cobb County, Ga., stating that he and Marianne Gingrich have been separated since May 10th and are working on a divorce agreement that would ``resolve all matters and controversies between them.''
The papers, filed by Gingrich's personal attorney J. Randolph Evans, stated little else other than Gingrich has reserved his right to ``set forth additional grounds for divorce'' if the parties can not reach an amicable conclusion to the marriage.
``Marianne is saddened and disappointed at Newt's decision,'' said Victoria Toensing, her personal attorney based in Washington.
This is Gingrich's second marriage.
He divorced his first wife, Jackie, two years after his 1978 election to Congress.
Attempts to reach the former speaker were unsuccessful.
Those who know the couple say there have been problems in the marriage dating back to Gingrich's unexpected resignation as speaker of the House last fall.
Gingrich is best known leading the Republican Party's takeover of the House in 1994.
During that so-called Republican Revolution, Gingrich emphasized that ``family values'' should be a core pillar in American society.
Friends in Georgia and Washington expressed sorrow, suggesting that the years in the spotlight might have been the cause.
``It's very sad, but it's a fact of life and a high price to pay (for being in public life),'' said Rich Galen, a longtime aide to Gingrich in Washington.
``The stresses of public life that occasionally become overwhelming.''
``All I hope is that they will be able to resolve and end this relationship with the degree of privacy and discretion of anyone who is in private life.''
