Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle his divorce by relying on a financial agreement he and his wife worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former House Speaker came back to an empty home.
``All she left was a television and a guest bed,'' Thomas Browning, Gingrich's divorce attorney, said.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 amid allegations he is having an affair with 33-year-old congressional aide Callista Bisek.
Documents related to the divorce filed Friday in Cobb County Superior Court include a separation agreement signed by the couple and notarized in December 1987.
There is no indication it was ever filed.
Browning said Marianne Gingrich called her husband on his birthday in June 1987 to tell him she was leaving him.
Gingrich, he said, came back to Georgia to find his home emptied out.
Browning said the pair maintained separate residences for six years before reconciling in late 1993 or early 1994.
The separation agreement called for Mrs. Gingrich to get $2,000 a month for six months, control over money market and checking accounts and the couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird.
It made Gingrich responsible for the couple's bank loans and a Hecht's department store account.
The couple also divided the furniture in Washington residence and in their apartment in Jonesboro.
Gingrich, who now runs a political consulting firm, filed his request after his wife asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband transferred ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
Gingrich has denied the allegation.
Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from Ohio, referred all questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney John Mayoue.
Mayoue was out of the office Monday and could not be reached for comment.
