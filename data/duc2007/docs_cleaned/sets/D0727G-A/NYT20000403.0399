``We're all done except for the formality of going to the judge and getting it approved,'' said attorney Randy Evans.
Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson has set a hearing for Thursday morning.
Even if Robinson accepts the settlement, which is nearly certain, its terms will likely remain a secret.
Evans said both sides will ask the judge to sign an order sealing the agreement, which would keep it out of the public court file.
``When you've got this much stuff, you just try to take your time and get it right,'' Evans said.
The Gingriches agreed to settle their divorce Dec. 16, 1999, during a court-ordered mediation session that lasted 12 hours and ended well after midnight.
The tentative agreement, which the Gingriches have kept private, ended what had become a bitter divorce process for Gingrich and his wife of 18 years.
The specter of potentially embarrassing depositions in the case led Gingrich, 56, to admit to a six-year affair with Callista Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the U.S. House Agriculture Committee.
Divorce attorneys watching the case predicted early on that Gingrich would settle the case, rather than allow his personal life to be examined in a public trial.
The Gingriches' divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and Marianne Gingrich's first.
The couple had no children together.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years, and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, has remained in the couple's Marietta, Ga., home during the divorce proceedings.
Gingrich has spent most of his time in Washington, D.C. Gingrich makes a living these days giving speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst on Fox News.
He also holds two fellowships and maintains a nonprofit committee devoted to his political ideals.
