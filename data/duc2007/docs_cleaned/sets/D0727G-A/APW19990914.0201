Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of their divorce proceedings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday.
The confidential agreement on who owns what between Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, was reached Monday and ``gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney.
Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, told the newspaper that an agreement was reached, but would give no details.
The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was expected to attract national media, especially after the disclosure of Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Mrs. Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing Gingrich of trying to transfer assets before the divorce filing.
Gingrich, 56, said in a separate filing that Mrs. Gingrich held all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated.
He further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those assets.
Phone calls to Gingrich's office and Mrs. Gingrich's house went unanswered late Monday.
