Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker.
Callista Bisek, a staff member of the House Agriculture Committee, is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition Wednesday in the Gingriches' divorce case.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich.
The couple married 18 years ago.
Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich gave Ms. Bisek funds or spent the couple's money on her.
Earlier this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final.
The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker.
Those include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms. Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms. Bisek's home and cellular phone records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video recordings of the two.
The subpoena also requests any clothes or other personal items belonging to Gingrich that Ms. Bisek has in her possession.
Neither attorney in the case was available for comment Friday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in today's editions.
