Frustrated by his estranged wife's attempts to probe his finances, business dealings, and his relationship with a Washington congressional aide, the former U.S. House speaker has unleashed his divorce lawyers.
Gingrich, who rose to power by aggressively attacking Democrats in Congress, will now put the same energy toward proving that his wife shares the blame for the marriage's collapse, one of his attorneys said Tuesday.
In pleadings released in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich, 56, is demanding that Marianne Gingrich sit for a videotaped deposition on Oct. 19 just as she has demanded a videotaped interrogation of Callista Bisek, a House Agriculture Committee aide.
Gingrich also is asking that Marianne Gingrich be ordered to account for all the couple's cash and stocks.
Although the couple's accountant says otherwise, Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich has not complied with a Sept. 10 agreement that requires both to dump whatever money they have into a joint account managed by an independent accountant.
The arrangement temporarily secures the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Evans said he'll file another motion today asking a judge to hold Marianne Gingrich in contempt.
The new filings are part of a nasty turn in the Gingriches' split, as Gingrich takes the offensive for the first time since filing for divorce in July.
Evans has been filling in reporters across the country on the new strategy, telling them that Gingrich has wanted to settle the case without probes into his and Marianne Gingrich's personal lives and finances outside their marriage.
Such digging is costly and could harm both their earning potential, Evans said.
But Marianne Gingrich, 48, has insisted that her husband and Bisek answer questions about their relationship under oath.
She also wants Bisek to turn over any gifts, letters or other correspondence she may have received from Gingrich.
Bisek, 33, has asked a Washington judge to block the deposition, arguing in part that since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia, she shouldn't be asked to incriminate herself.
``As a result, we are forced to litigate,'' Evans said.
``We are going to proceed as quickly as we can to get this to trial.''
In the meantime, Gingrich is accusing his wife of not accounting for some of the public speaking money he has earned since the September financial agreement.
The fees for his speeches, which can be as high as $50,000, go directly to Marianne Gingrich, who manages all the couple's money, Evans said.
Gingrich says he's earned more than the $5,000 his wife has deposited in the joint account so far.
``I'm not aware of any improprieties on either parties' behalf,'' said Harvey Cohen, the certified public accountant hired by the Gingriches to manage the account under their agreement.
Cohen said the speech money is tied up in Gingrich Enterprises, the company the Gingriches set up jointly to manage the business end of Gingrich's speaking career.
Cohen said he is waiting for the proper paperwork to be completed so the funds can be transferred.
