Her attorney has asked a Cobb County judge for permission to depose Joe Gaylord, whom Gingrich once described as an advisor ``on all aspects of my life and career'' and one of his ``closest friends.''
Gaylord has worked closely with Gingrich and his campaigns since the early 1980s, and he served for a time as executive director of GOPAC.
Newt Gingrich used the powerful political action committee to train Republican candidates for Congress in his long effort to win a GOP majority in the U.S. House, and he credits Gaylord for helping him do it in 1994.
According to motions released Tuesday, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, also wants to take a deposition from unnamed representatives of GOPAC and the Friends of Newt Gingrich campaign committee, for which Gaylord also worked.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said he knows only that Private Enterprise Partners was an entity set up by Gaylord.
Gaylord was reached at a Washington number for Private Enterprise Partners on Tuesday, but declined to comment on the request for his depositions.
He also declined to say what the company's purpose is.
``I'm not a part of this story,'' he said.
Mayoue won't comment on the organization either, and he won't say what information he hopes to learn from the depositions.
Mayoue needs Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson's permission to take the depositions because the subjects live out of state, in the Washington area.
``My best guess is they're just trying to pin down the finance pieces,'' said Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney.
Now that the Gingriches have decided how to temporarily split their assets until their contentious divorce is final, lawyers for both sides have been freed up to concentrate on the next phase of the case discovery.
Sanford Ain, a Washington, D.C.-based divorce lawyer who makes a specialty of representing high-profile politicians, said depositions are particularly useful in the information-gathering phase of a divorce case, especially when it comes to assets.
``What you're really trying to find out is how much money and where it is,'' Ain said.
Depositions also allow lawyers to confirm information they already have, and force witnesses to commit to testimony they would give at trial.
Tactically, the threat of a deposition can increase ``pressure to come to a settlement,'' Ain added.
Marianne Gingrich has already won permission to take at least one deposition that could help pressure a settlement.
On Sept. 29, 33-year-old congressional aid Callista Bisek is scheduled to answer questions under oath about her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
