Last May, Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce.
He didn't mention the affair had been going on for six years.
The remarks are her most extensive since the days immediately after her husband's July divorce petition was filed.
The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House, surprised his wife.
And it jolted many of Gingrich's colleagues still in Congress, fueling an already bubbling debate over the impact of Gingrich's divorce on his unofficial role in the Republican Party.
Last week, Gingrich's attorneys said his ``intimate relationship'' with congressional aide Callista Bisek started in November 1993, about a year before the Republican takeover of the U.S. House.
The revelation was made before an impromptu gathering of reporters outside Washington and it stung, Marianne Gingrich said.
``This is about a marriage.
This is not about politics and another press conference.
This is about my life,'' she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Marianne Gingrich said she heard about the news conference from a friend, who called her from a cell phone shortly afterwards.
She said her thoughts immediately went back to late 1993.
Newt Gingrich's attorneys have said he and Marianne were separated when the relationship with Bisek began.
But Marianne Gingrich says she and her husband were living together in a Marietta, Ga., condo.
And while he was in Washington, she was traveling between Ohio, where her mother was recovering from a diabetes-related illness, and Florida, where her brother was fighting cancer.
``In general, my family was in medical crisis,'' she said.
Her brother later died of lymphoma.
Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of her 18-year marriage and her husband's affair.
``However, it's been good for me to be involved in a number of community activities, including the Red Cross and Mission Specialties.''
Marianne Gingrich, 48, is chairwoman of the Red Cross' Northwest Metro Service Center.
She's also helping Mission Specialties, an international service organization, raise money to buy shoes for Russian orphans.
In a People magazine article that comes out today, Marianne Gingrich said she has lost 35 pounds, the result of stress and diet.
She plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when attorneys for Bisek, 33, will try to persuade a judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn over documents related to her relationship to Newt Gingrich, 56.
Meanwhile, the divorce is beginning to concern some of Gingrich's GOP colleagues.
Some Republicans in Congress are fretting over whether Gingrich should be invited to a January celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Republican takeover of Congress.
Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said Wednesday that he expects Gingrich to be invited to the January event.
But U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) did not endorse an invitation when he and Coverdell discussed the event with reporters.
Rep. J.D.
Hayworth (R-Ariz.) argued that Gingrich's new job as a political commentator for Fox News makes it inappropriate to include him in political gatherings.
``Time marches on.
He's gone on to other pursuits,'' Hayworth said.
But, then, he added, ``If you're looking for a spirited defense of the speaker's private life from me, you'll not get one.''
Other Republicans in Congress, from Georgia and elsewhere, have jumped to Gingrich's defense.
``It's only right that we invite Newt Gingrich to return for any celebration.
His ideas and his vision put together the Contract With America,'' Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.) said.
``His biggest problem was that he thought out loud.''
Last week, on the same day Gingrich's attorneys said his affair with Bisek stretched back six years, Republican House members who took office in 1995 held a reunion in Washington.
Gingrich's attendance at that gathering had been an issue, too.
As it turned out, he was in New Orleans and couldn't make it, organizers said.
