The commander of Israel's armed forces said Monday that Israel has to be ready for a pre-emptive strike against Iran, should this become necessary.
Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz was commenting on last week's military parade in Tehran in which Shahab-3 missiles capable of reaching Israel were shown.
Mofaz told Israel that the missiles, together with the nuclear warheads which Israel believes Iran is developing, pose ``a long-term threat to Israel's survival.''
Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction.
Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh from the opposition Labor Party said Sunday that Israel must consider a pre-emptive strike against Iran, using conventional weapons.
Other lawmakers criticized Sneh's statement as irresponsible.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no call for such declarations.
However, Mofaz said Monday that the concept of a pre-emptive strike against an imminent threat is ``part of the world view'' of the Israeli armed forces.
At the start of the 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli air force destroyed most of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces in a pre-emptive strike.
In 1981, Israeli fighter bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor in Iraq shortly before it was to become operational.
Israel believed the reactor would be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year, before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project now in the testing stage, will be ready.
He said Iran is developing atomic weapons at the same fast rate.
Mofaz did not say how a pre-emptive strike against Iran would be carried out.
The Israeli air force recently took delivery of a new version of the American F-15 warplane which is capable of reaching Iran.
