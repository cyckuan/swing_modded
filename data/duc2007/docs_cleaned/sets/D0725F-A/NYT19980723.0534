Testing such an advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense Middle East.
It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami, is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved relations with the United States.
Islamic conservatives strongly opposed to President Khatami's foreign and domestic policies still wield paramount power in Iran.
That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most influential pro-Khatami newspaper.
Washington must now try to divine what the missile test reveals about the power struggle in Iran and the ability of President Khatami to produce more moderate foreign policies.
The Clinton administration's efforts to renew a dialogue with Iran should be pursued, but they must also be realistic.
The administration also needs to initiate wider diplomatic efforts to curtail outside aid to Iranian missile programs.
The missile tested Wednesday is based on a design imported from North Korea.
But Russia and China have also repeatedly exported sensitive missile technology to Iran.
Washington should demand that Russia and China tighten their export controls and punish violators.
It should also press North Korea to end rogue missile exports.
The administration ought to devote some attention to reassuring Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy and feels newly vulnerable.
Syria already has missiles capable of reaching Israel; Iraqi Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Iran may soon pose a missile threat.
The immediate dangers facing Israel, however, have not substantially increased, and Israel should not act precipitously.
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear weapons.
That allows some time for arms control and diplomacy.
Israel can also improve its regional security by pursuing efforts to negotiate peace with the Palestinians.
Iran's missile test is a warning of future danger that should not be ignored.
