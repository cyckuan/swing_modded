Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday night.
The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, and of altering the political and military balance of power in the Middle East, he said.
``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the test on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were still poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they believe Iran bought from North Korea.
The officials are certain that Iran successfully tested the medium-range missile, but could not provide immediate information on the location of the launching site or the area where it landed except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
Israel is the only nuclear power in the region, and its missiles are believed to be capable of striking any nation in the Middle East.
Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed to be years away from building and testing such a weapon.
But the United States is not certain of the size or sophistication of its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
The test on Wednesday comes as the United States and Iran have been making cautious overtures toward improving relations, after a long chill.
Just last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright praised President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last summer and who has confronted considerable resistance from religious and other conservatives.
But Ms. Albright, in a speech devoted to steps for improving relations, also called on Iran to show evidence that it was not trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not its intentions, officials said.
``This is a demonstration of Iran's perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said.
``It's now clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of capability.''
The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very closely.
``And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a large-scale force are two very different things.
It could take years for Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our best to retard that.''
Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with hard currency.
The official North Korean news agency issued a statement last month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money we need at present.''
Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
Tehran's foremost goal, a senior administration official said, is not to strike its enemies but to be seen as a political and military force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
``There is some prestige element here,'' he said.
``We have long thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the Middle East.''
The former intelligence official said that government experts had expected a test by Iran, although the launch was not expected so soon.
He also said that the test held political significance as well as military meaning.
``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement is: `You are now vulnerable.
You have to take us seriously.'''
But he said he doubted that the Iranians meant to be belligerent toward the Saudis, saying ``They want to co-opt the Saudis, not threaten them.''
The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology as well as North Korean technology, for many years.
``The important point here is that they have very little indigenous internal capability to make a real missile, and they've required extensive outside technical support,'' this former official said.
``But they've been willing to spend the money.
I'd guess the Rodong would cost $10 million,'' referring to the North Korean missile.
Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting ability, he said.
But it proves the Iranians have passed a milestone in military technology.
``In the long term,'' he said, ``the missile production assistance they've gotten from Russia and China will have the greater impact.
But the Rodongs are the attention-getters.''
Iran has a well-established Scud missile program dating back to the war with Iraq of the 1980s.
That war, a U.S. intelligence analyst said on Wednesday, ``gave them the experience of using missiles as a weapon of terror, both at receiving and delivering terror.''
In that war both nations attacked their opponent's major cities with short range missiles and Tehran was all but evacuated at times.
Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year U.N. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.
Beyond that, they were struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the test.
``Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves or whether they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong either way, this is a North Korean missile with another name.''
The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.
Administration officials contend that they have had some success in limiting Russian and Chinese military assistance to Iran.
Russia said last week it was investigating nine companies for illegally providing weapons technology to Iran, and the United States imposed trade restrictions on those firms.
