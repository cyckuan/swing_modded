Iran on Friday dismissed as "baseless" the Israeli claim that it had bought chemical weapons parts and technologies from an Israeli arms trader.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that such baseless claims by Israeli officials indicated Israeli uneasiness over Iran's diplomatic efforts made at the international arena to curb the danger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons.
Mohammadi made the comments after an Israeli court convicted Wednesday Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, of illegally selling biological and chemical weapons parts and knowhow to Iran for 16 millions U.S. dollars in the past years.
Manbar is expected to be sentenced to life sentence on this charge.
The spokesman accused high-ranking Israeli officials of spreading false rumors against Iran, saying Tehran is seriously trying to cleanse the Middle East from nuclear arms.
He noted that the Israeli accusation coincided with Iran's successful efforts to pressure Israel on the nuclear issue.
He added that Iran believes security would be restored in the Middle East region through controlling and curbing Israel's atomic efforts.
He stressed that Israel can not legitimize its occupation even through its nuclear weapons.
Mohammadi finally urged the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct inspection of Israel's nuclear facilities.
Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability.
Although western intelligence reports claimed that Israel has about 200 nuclear warheads, Israel has neither denied nor confirmed that it has nuclear weapons.
Worried that its leading enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed to build a nuclear bomb.
