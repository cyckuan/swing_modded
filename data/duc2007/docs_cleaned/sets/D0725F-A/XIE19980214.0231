Iran has neither the technological capability nor the intention of making nuclear weapons, said Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Nikitovich Mikhailov on Friday.
Mikhailov was responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent remarks indicating that Iran is making atomic weapons, the Interfax Agency reported.
Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mikhailov said, adding that the IAEA has inspected the nuclear facilities in Iran many times but discovered no problems.
And the minister stressed that the nuclear power station to be built by Iran with Russian assistance is purely for peaceful use.
The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation.
Washington has repeatedly asked Moscow to abandon its plan to help Tehran build a nuclear power station under an agreement between the two countries signed in 1995.
Russia has so far refused to yield to U.S. pressure even though the U.S. has threatened to suspend economic assistance to Russia.
