Iran's Defense Ministry and Armed Forces Logistics issued a statement here Saturday, dismissing a Turkish newspaper report that Iran intends to carry out nuclear tests.
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons, and all its atomic programs are based on "peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical, agricultural and energy-generation purposes" and "within the framework of the internationally-recognized absolute rights of any country."
Tehran has been accused by the U.S. of being ambitious in pursuing non-conventional weapons capabilities, a charge which Iran has repeatedly denied.
Iran is determined to stick to a principled policy of making Persian Gulf and the Middle East region free of non-conventional arms, including nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry, said the statement.
"Despite Iran's location in an area where there are mounting nuclear challenges, the Iranian armed forces do not have any research program on use of nuclear energy for military purposes," it said.
It attacked Israel for possessing a nuclear arsenal and refusing to subject it to international supervision.
