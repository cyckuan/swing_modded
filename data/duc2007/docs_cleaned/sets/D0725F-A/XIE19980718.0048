Russia and Iran confirmed their commitment of non-proliferation and share an idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a press release on Saturday.
Officials from the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries held consultations in Tehran on July 15-16 to discuss the problem of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and export controls, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
The two sides emphasized the need for non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles for their delivery on the global and regional scale, the Russian ministry said.
It was reported that the two countries after the consultations adopted a joint statement on a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.
They stressed that the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the region would strengthen global peace and security both at the international and regional levels.
The two sides proposed that the countries of the region should refrain from developing, producing, testing and acquiring nuclear weapons and from deploying them on their territory.
At the same time, Moscow and Tehran confirmed the inalienable right of all countries to acquire and develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
