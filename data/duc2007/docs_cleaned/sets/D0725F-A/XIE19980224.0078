The U.S. State Department reaffirmed its opposition Monday to Russian participation in the construction of a nuclear reactor in Iran.
"We are opposed to any form of nuclear cooperation with Tehran, given its demonstrated interest acquiring a nuclear weapons capability," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
Last week, Russia confirmed its intention to complete work on the Bushehr nuclear power project and strongly denied U.S. allegations the plant could help Tehran build an atomic bomb.
Russia said Iran's technological potential does not allow it to produce nuclear weapons.
Rubin credited Russia with not cooperating with Iran on projects that could be the most dangerous in terms of nuclear proliferation.
