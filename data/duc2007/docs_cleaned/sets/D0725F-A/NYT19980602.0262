After India and Pakistan, what is next?
While the Clinton administration tried to stop the nuclear arms race in south Asia, senior officials turned their attention Monday to the next possible nuclear hot spot.
Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials, although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several years away from having devices that work.
The arms buildup on the Korean peninsula is less of a concern because North Korea, beset by financial problems, has curtailed its nuclear weapons program.
But the officials in Washington admitted that events of the past three weeks have shown that the United States cannot prevent the rise of other nuclear states.
And economic sanctions will not sway Iran, which has no formal relations or trade with the United States.
Officials at the State Department and other agencies disagreed over the most pressing issue: how to prevent India and Pakistan from turning nuclear devices into completed weapons that can be delivered by missile.
While some in the administration are calling for the strongest sanctions possible, others argue that India and Pakistan need an incentive to stop their tests and join the community of nations committed to ending nuclear proliferation.
``We're at a loss over what to do,'' said an official familiar with the discussion.
``We have to show them that there's another avenue economic security instead of nuclear security.''
The debate has been complicated by federal laws requiring Clinton to impose rigid sanctions on countries that test nuclear devices.
The sanctions can be lifted only with the consent of both houses of Congress.
``Unless there are some positive steps that India and Pakistan can take to get out of the sanctions, there's no point in having sanctions,'' said Tom Collina, a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
At the same time, the Commerce Department argued Monday against fully applying economic sanctions against Pakistan, which said it conducted six nuclear tests last week.
The officials warned that the government in Islamabad would retaliate against American companies that are engaged in multi-million-dollar energy projects and other businesses in Pakistan.
Senior Pakistani members of Parliament also warned that prolonged sanctions might force their government to reconsider its allies.
Ghul Sarwar Cheema, a retired Pakistani general who was involved in Pakistan's clandestine nuclear program for more than a decade, has suggested that Pakistan might share its nuclear know-how with other countries.
``For the moment, nobody is even thinking of doing that,'' he said in an interview.
``But necessity is the mother of invention.
Don't force us, don't invite us, do not do it.''
For now, officials agree that both India and Pakistan should immediately stop testing nuclear warheads, halt missile tests, end the production of weapons-grade fuel, and join 149 other countries in signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
It all sounds quite logical.
And that's the problem: Logic has failed since India's tests rocked the western state of Rajasthan on May 11.
``The United States has articulated a series of steps that, if taken, could cap the crisis right now and contain the damage,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a specialist on nuclear proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
But, he added, ``I am personally pessimistic about the ability of rational actors to influence the process at this point.
Passions are running hot and heavy and there are many variables beyond anyone's control.''
Clinton cut short a trip to Texas to return to Washington to confer with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tomorrow morning before she joins foreign ministers of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members in Geneva to discuss the arms race in south Asia.
Michael Krepon, president of the non-profit Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies arms control, said the turmoil in south Asia has overshadowed significant achievements of the past 15 years in halting the spread of nuclear weapons.
The United States and the former Soviet Union have dismantled thousands of nuclear warheads.
South Africa, a former emerging nuclear power, stopped its nuclear program before reaching weapon capacity.
In South America, Argentina, and Brazil pulled back from the brink of a nuclear arms race.
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have all agreed to rid their territories of nuclear warheads deployed during the Soviet era.
Iraq's nuclear weapons program has been largely destroyed.
Iran continues to raise the greatest concerns.
In a 1994 speech in Washington, James Woolsey, then director of central intelligence, warned that Iran could become a nuclear state by the year 2002 to 2004.
That estimate has been pushed back slightly, but Israeli intelligence services maintain that Iran might have a nuclear device as soon as 2001.
In Washington, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which opposes the regime in Tehran, said the government has been pursuing a nuclear buildup known as the ``great secret plan.''
