Iran on Thursday appealed the international community for practical steps to reinforce the treaty on disarmament and for elimination of nuclear arms.
The appeal was made by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Javad Zarif in Vienna, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
As long as nuclear arsenal exists in the world, the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) will not succeed, said the minister who was attending a three-day conference on Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which opened in Vienna on Wednesday.
The CTBT is a prerequisite for the NPT and the international community should take actions in safeguarding the peaceful use of nuclear technology, said the minister.
The NPT should be used to reinforce disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear technology as well, he added.
Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain nuclear capability, a charge repeatedly denied by Tehran.
Iran said it was pursuing peaceful use of nuclear energy in different fields, which is an inalienable right of any country in the world.
