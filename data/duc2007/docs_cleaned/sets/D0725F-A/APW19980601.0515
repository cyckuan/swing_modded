Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new security situation'' on the country, the defense minister said in comments published Monday.
``Just as the whole international and regional order has been affected by the present situation, Iran too has been placed in a new security situation,'' Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani said in an interview with Tehran's Jameah daily.
``Iran must take a new look at its security and strategic situations, but this does not mean entry into the age of nuclear activity,'' Shamkhani was quoted as saying.
India tested five nuclear devices last month, which were followed by six explosions by arch-rival Pakistan.
But the tests do not put Iran under pressure to start its own nuclear weapons program, Shamkhani said.
``The present arena concerns only India and Pakistan,'' he was quoted as saying.
Iran denies repeated U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is close to building an atom bomb, saying its nuclear program is peaceful.
Just before he was toppled by Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, the U.S.-backed shah launched an ambitious nuclear program which he said was meant to guarantee future energy needs.
The program was abandoned after the revolution, but restarted in 1988.
So far, Iran is only known to have several small nuclear research facilities.
Russia is currently building a dlrs 800 million nuclear reactor in southern Iran despite opposition by the United States, which says the facility could provide Tehran with the means to build a bomb.
Iran has good military ties with China, which is believed to have helped Pakistan build its bombs.
