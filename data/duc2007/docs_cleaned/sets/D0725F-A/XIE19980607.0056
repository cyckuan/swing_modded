Commander of Iranian Naval Forces Abbas Mohtaj said on Sunday that the forthcoming joint Iran-India naval game has nothing to do with Iran's stand towards nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan last month.
Mohtaj confirmed that two Indian vessels have arrived at Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf to join a week-long drill with Iranian navy due to start on June 9, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
He added that the exercises are very elementary and of no operational significance because of the low number of vessels due to participate.
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban treaty and believes that any action by any country to carry out nuclear test is provocative.
Iran has good relations with both Islamabad and New Delhi on diplomatic and defensive grounds, he added.
India donated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13, threatening to spark a round of nuclear arms race in the subcontinent.
Pakistan, under great domestic pressure, conducted two rounds of nuclear tests in response two weeks later.
