Russia reiterated Thursday that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
Iran's activity in the nuclear sphere is being controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has not reported any violations on the part of that country, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has just returned from a visit to Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Rakhmanin said.
During Adamov's visit to Tehran, the two countries signed an agreement to accelerate the construction of a nuclear reactor in Bushehr and contemplate possible cooperation in building more nuclear power stations in Iran.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently criticized the Russia-Iran agreement as a threat to the entire region.
He expressed hope that Russia will revise this initiative because, he said, it contradicts attempts to achieve peace and stability in the region, Interfax reported.
