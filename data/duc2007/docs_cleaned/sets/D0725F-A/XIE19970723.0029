Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said here today that Iran is committed to the human and Islamic principles and is not after the nuclear arms at all.
The 64-year-old president declared that his country decisively supports the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and elimination of the ominous phenomenon of the nuclear war.
Rafsanjani made the remark in a meeting with Hans Blix, Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
He said "Iranian nuclear programs are crystal clear and transparent and for humanitarian purposes.
We always welcome sharing experience with respective international agencies."
Blix appreciated the current cooperation between Iran and the IAEA, saying Iran allows the agency to inspect any nuclear center in Iran at any time.
He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes.
Blix turned down the doubts by certain countries over Iran's purpose of developing the nuclear industry, saying the question is biased for political ends.
"It is the natural right of any nation to acquire nuclear technology for the production of electricity, the manufacture of medicine, its application in the humanitarian areas and the protection of the environment," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
Blix, who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, inspected a nuclear research facility in Bonab, in northwestern province of Eastern Azerbaijan.
He said "the activities of Bonab nuclear research facilities is completely directed toward peaceful purposes and toward the economic development of Iran."
Iran's nuclear industry is under constant scrutiny of the United States and Israel, which Tehran regards as two main rivals.
Both Washington and Tel Aviv maintain that Iran is seeking to use nuclear technology for military purposes.
The U.S. and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic bomb.
Iran is finishing the power plant with help from Russia.
Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf.
