Iran has rejected as "unfounded" an allegation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Iran is seeking access to atomic warheads.
Hamid Reza Asefi, the spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry, said Sunday the allegation was fabricated by Israel with the mere objective to divert the public opinion from dangerous schemes of Israel, "which has turned the region into a depot of nuclear weapons."
Netanyahu voiced Israel's concern over Iran's nuclear programs after Tehran and Moscow signed a memorandum of understanding last Tuesday to promote their nuclear cooperation.
Under the memorandum signed at the end of a visit by Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov to Iran, the two countries will form expert groups to discuss building more nuclear power plants in Iran.
"As the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly announced, Iran-Russia nuclear cooperation is for peaceful purposes" and Iran carries out its peaceful atomic programs under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the spokesman said.
However, Asefi pointed out that Iran considers self-defense based on internationally recognized principles as its legitimate right.
Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear plant in Bushehr in southern Bushehr province according to a contract concluded in 1994 between the two countries.
