These usually come from the American government rather than their own.
The biggest shock came in July, when the American Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a computer-simulated target.
For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments.
But even the Arrow's most enthusiastic advocates acknowledge that it will not provide Israel with an impenetrable shield.
And its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist, reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of $1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the Shahab-3 may already be operational.
The previous, cozy assumption of defense experts that some time must elapse between testing and deployment no longer holds good.
Weldon also believes that as early as next year, Iran will be able to test (and presumably soon deploy) another system, the Shahab-4, with a 2,000-kilometer range that runs deep into Central Europe.
Yet, even for Israelis, the most troubling recent development in missile proliferation was the news on Aug. 31 that North Korea had launched a three-stage missile, known as the Taepo Dong, which is apparently capable of reaching the western fringes of Alaska.
On past experience, whatever rocket technology appears in North Korea will then spread rapidly to Pakistan and Iran.
There is, of course, no simple correlation between the range of a country's rockets and the fear it arouses.
For instance, the West is not particularly alarmed, at least for the moment, by the fact that Saudi Arabia has rockets that can go farther than any other in the region.
The states whose arsenals keep western and Israeli security people awake at night are Iran and Iraq.
After lobbying vigorously to stem the flow of Russian technology to Iran, Israel appears to have accepted that nothing is likely to stop the Shahab series of missiles from being developed.
But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself could be in Iran's sights.
``The threat is not only to us, but to many others in the region,'' said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Sept. 21.
He might have added that Israel is probably not even particularly high on Iran's list of concerns.
Iran has been impelled into missile-building by memories of its weakness during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, when it was unable to retaliate in kind to the Iraqi missiles that caused panic, and thousands of civilian deaths, among its urban population.
Even so, Iran's defense minister, Adm. Ali Shamkhani, is relishing the consternation that the missile test has caused.
``God willing, this will not be the only time that dedicated and mobilized workers of our defense industry surprise Israel's defense machinery,'' he gloated.
