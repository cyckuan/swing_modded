The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
``We will continue to work hard to block those efforts,'' White House national security spokesman David Leavy said.
Although Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Russia insists its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm.
The New York Times reported Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon.
Director George Tenet has been briefing other U.S. policy-makers on the new assessment, the newspaper said.
National Security officials would not comment directly on the report but agreed that the possibility that Iran may be able to manufacture nuclear weapons has been a growing worry.
``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' Leavy said.
Intelligence and defense experts warned that Iran may be closer than previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal.
There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials to weapons.
As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach targets in the United States by 2010.
Officials now suggest the timetable might have to be shortened in light of the recent developments.
Russian engineers already are building a reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing contract.
Iran also has become a top customer of Russia's ailing defense industry with purchases of fighter jets, missiles, tanks and submarines.
On several occasions, Congress has sought to impose sanctions on countries helping Iran develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, an intention aimed primarily at Russia.
Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them.
Pentagon officials as well as military-minded members of Congress have used the possibility of nuclear attacks from Iran, North Korea and other potential U.S. enemies as a major rationale for moving to develop a national missile defense.
