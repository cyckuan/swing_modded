Stressing that it has no nuclear cooperation program with Ukraine, Iran Saturday expressed "surprise" at Kiev's announcement to cancel a nuclear contract with it, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
"Iran has no agreement with Ukraine on manufacturing turbines for nuclear reactors and it is surprising that Ukraine has made such a claim," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said at a press conference.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said on Friday that Kiev has decided to annul a contract to supply turbines to the Russia-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran.
Russia's assistance for Iran in the field has triggered accusations from the United States and Israel that Iran is seeking the technology for developing nuclear weapons.
It is noted Ukraine's move was made when U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was visiting the country.
Iran's nuclear activities are for peaceful means, Mohammadi said, stressing that it complies with international regulations and puts the nuclear activities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The baseless ballyhoos of the U.S. and Israel are aimed at blocking the development of other countries, which is their legitimate right, he said.
He contended that Iran will not deprive itself of utilizing nuclear technology for its development drive.
