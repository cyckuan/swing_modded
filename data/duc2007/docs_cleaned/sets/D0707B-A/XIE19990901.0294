The European Union (EU) can no longer put off the question of Turkey's possible entrance into the continent-wide union, said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini Tuesday.
Talking with the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Dini said the EU will have to "recognize Turkey's right to bear the title of candidate of the union" at its December meeting in Helsinki.
The Italian foreign minister added that in the face of the recent devastating earthquake in Turkey, the EU "cannot further delay the choice" for Ankara.
"In light of the recent tragedies, the economy of a great Mediterranean country is at risk," Dini told the newspaper.
"The European Union, without renouncing its principles," will have to decide in December to allow Turkey to become a formal candidate for EU membership.
