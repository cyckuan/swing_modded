Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday that Italy expects Ocalan's trial in Turkey will meet standards and guarantees laid down by the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member.
He said that those conventions do not envisage the death penalty, and the Ocalan case could test Turkey's ability to meet European standards and may help its bid to join the European Union.
He said Italy would continue to support that bid as long as Turkey moves closer to Europe on human and civil rights and the treatment of minorities, the main stumbling block to its EU ambitions.
Dini added that Italy and the European Union condemned all forms of terrorism and urged Kurds everywhere to refrain from violent protest against Ocalan's capture.
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that Ocalan was brought to Turkey from Nairobi.
Ocalan's Italian lawyers confirmed that Tuesday morning that the Greek embassy in Nairobi had turned Ocalan to Kenyan authorities, and then with the permission of Kenya, Turkey took Ocalan back to the country with a special military airplane.
