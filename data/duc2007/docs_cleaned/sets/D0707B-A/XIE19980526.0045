German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Monday he did not expect that Turkey would be admitted into the European Union "in foreseeable future".
"The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's economic problems and its relations with Greece," said Kinkel at a conference on the subject of "Islam and Europe" in Berlin.
Despite the EU membership dispute with Turkey, Kinkel stressed Germany wanted to strengthen relations with the country in all areas.
The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy in the future.
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has blamed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for blocking Turkey's entry into the EU due to its Islamic background.
