Greece threatened Thursday to react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a 155- million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas attributed the commission's decision to "expediencies."
Greece's reaction would be without delay, he added.
The spokesman said that Greece would increase its bilateral contacts in order to promote the country's national interests in the most effective way.
The European Commission's proposal for the release of the EU funds to Turkey, which was raised by External Affairs Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, was approved Wednesday.
The commission's plan will prevent Greece from exercising its right to veto by introducing a new regulation terming Turkey a developing country, which requires only a special majority for approval by the EU Council of Ministers.
In 1996, Greece blocked an aid package worth 450 million dollars accompanying the EU-Turkey customs union.
Earlier this week, Greece warned that it would refer the European Commission to the European Court of Justice.
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
