Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara.
``Although wrong assessments by the European Union persist, with the definition of Turkey by the European Commission as one of the 12 candidate countries, the road toward developing our relations has opened,'' Minister Ismail Cem said in a statement.
After the decision in December to exclude Turkey from the first wave of enlargement talks, Turkey put its relations with the 15-member union on hold.
Since then, the EU has been trying to patch up the relationship, with several leaders of member countries insisting that Turkey's place is in the union.
The European Commission released Thursday its first set of regular reports assessing the progress towards EU membership of 12 candidate countries, including 10 central and eastern European countries and Cyprus and Turkey.
The EU ambassador to Turkey, Karen Fogg, insisted that the report ``did not signal a new status of Turkey, but the confirmation that Turkey is a candidate country.''
In any case, the report indicated Turkish membership would not come soon.
``The persistent violations of human rights and important deficiencies in the treatment of minorities are causes of concern,'' the report on Turkey stated.
Turkish authorities are frequently accused of systematically violating human rights, especially in the southeast where Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.
The Commission also criticized the lack of civilian control over the military, which plays a central role in the country's political life.
The report praised Turkey's economic policy but said it still had a long way to go in the adoption of EU legal and administrative standards.
