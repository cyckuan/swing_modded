The European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU.
The Commission Wednesday made the proposal in a bid to improve its badly soured relations with Turkey over Ankara's frustrated efforts to be accepted as a candidate for EU membership.
It urged the EU members to release a fund of some 375 million ECUs (around 400 million U.S. dollars) to finance the strategy, which includes a broader customs union and cooperation in industry, services and agriculture.
"The European strategy which we proposed for Turkey will lead to a deepening of our relations.
This will be to the benefit of all our citizens," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said at a press conference.
He indicated that Turkey's democratic institutions and human rights records must be improved in order to prepare itself for the eventual EU membership.
In a second report to the European Parliament, the Commission said the Turkish government's program for improving the human rights situation and democratization "has not yet had sufficient impact on the situation."
