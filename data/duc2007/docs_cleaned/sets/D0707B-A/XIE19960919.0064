The European Parliament today voted to block a 53 million ECU (70 million U.S. dollars) special aid package to Turkey because of what it called a "deterioration in the human rights situation" in the country.
Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted 319 for, 23 against the resolution with 20 abstentions, according to local media reports.
The European Parliament accused Turkey of "increasing provocation in the Aegean Sea and in Cyprus, and aggressions in the north of Iraq."
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union (EU) and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides.
The European Parliament also called on the European Commission not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the "Meda" program for Mediterranean countries, except for projects concerning the "promotion of democracy and human rights."
The resolution condemned "the brutal assassination of two Greek Cypriots by Turkish soldiers supported by para-military forces," during inter-ethnic confrontation last month on the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
