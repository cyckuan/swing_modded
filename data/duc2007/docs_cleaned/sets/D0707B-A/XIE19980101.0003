Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos today called on neighboring Turkey to change its stance towards Greece.
In his new year message, Tsohatzopoulos stressed that aggressiveness did not help Turkey's relations with the European Union (EU), and Turkey should give serious consideration to the problems noted by the 15-nation bloc.
He pointed out that if Turkey realised this in the future, it would greatly help to improve the current climate.
Earlier this month, the EU decided not to include Turkey on the list of nations waiting to join the bloc, on the grounds of Turkey's "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece."
After that, Turkey announced the suspension of its political dialogue with the EU and increased its pressure upon Greece.
Tension between the two neighboring countries intensified recently with the mutual expulsion of diplomats and violations of Greek airspace by Turkish jet fighters.
