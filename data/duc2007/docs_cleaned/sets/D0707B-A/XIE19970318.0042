Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union (EU), which confirmed the perspective of Turkey's full membership to the group.
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here.
She said her country would make new efforts toward full EU membership.
"Our struggle will start from now on," she said.
The EU statement was issued Sunday at the end of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.
It said that Turkey was recognized as having a European future and it would be treated in the same way as others seeking the EU membership.
The statement came following a March 4 statement by the EU Christian Democrats which called Turkey's membership application unacceptable.
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU.
Turkey currently has a customs union agreement with the EU, which removed some trade barriers.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has also expressed his satisfaction over the EU message, saying that "Turkey's European horizon has been opened."
