Turkey said Wednesday it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week.
``Turkey's expectancy is that its candidacy be approved and confirmed legally,'' Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told reporters.
He added that Turkish officials were spurning an invitation to a summit dinner because Turkey wasn't a candidate.
Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with Greece.
An enlargement report for the Dec. 11-12 summit in Vienna includes Turkey among the 11 countries negotiating membership, but the list does not make it a candidate.
Atacanli said the document ``is far from meeting Turkey's expectations.''
