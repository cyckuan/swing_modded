Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU) membership.
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not overlook the fact that the neighboring country had responsibilities and obligations.
If Turkey was ready to undertake these responsibilities, Greece had no objection to helping, he noted.
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
Greece has also consistently blocked the more than 1-billion U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Turkey.
Greece has repeatedly said that it supports Turkey in its efforts to join EU but the condition is that Ankara must improve its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
To ease its tense relations with Turkey, Greece will in the near future partially lift its veto on EU funding for Turkey after the devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which has claimed thousands of lives.
