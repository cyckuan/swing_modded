The European Union and Turkey have met here to discuss the latter's prospect of accession to the 15-nation western bloc, the European Commission said Wednesday.
The bilateral meeting, held Tuesday between EU Economy and Finance Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira and Turkish Economy Minister Recep Onal, reviewed the fact that Turkey had initiated an economic stability program in order to decrease inflation and increase economic growth.
Both Solbes and Onal expressed their willingness to initiate a dialogue in the economic and monetary fields between the European Union and Turkey that was included in the accession list only last December.
The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey during the pre-accession period.
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
The heads of state and government of the European Union decided last December in Helsinki to include Turkey in its list of accession that already includes Poland, the Czech Republic , Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Malta.
The EU has started official accession negotiations with the 12 countries but did not do the same with Turkey.
Some EU member states have been criticizing the human rights record of the country that strides over two continents.
Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
