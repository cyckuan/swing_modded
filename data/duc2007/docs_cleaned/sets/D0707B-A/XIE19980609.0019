Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here Monday that Greece has no intention of preventing Turkey from being admitted into the European Union (EU).
Delivering a speech at the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting opening Monday morning in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, Pangalos said that Turkey is an European nation and its efforts for full EU membership should be encouraged.
"Greece has always supported the European orientation of Turkey.
Greece is opposed to the view that the European Union is limited by historic or religious traditions," Panglos said.
He noted that "Today's reality is different.
Participation of Turkey in the European Conference can be a successful first step."
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's efforts for EU membership, but the charge is rejected by Athens.
Ankara halted its political dialog with the EU last December when the EU Luxembourg summit excluded Turkey from the ranks of candidates for its enlargement process, saying that the European body made this decision on the basis of "a discriminative attitude " toward the Muslim country.
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus issue.
Regional security, such as the Kosovo issue, and economic cooperation will be taken up at the two-day foreign ministerial meeting of the Balkan countries.
