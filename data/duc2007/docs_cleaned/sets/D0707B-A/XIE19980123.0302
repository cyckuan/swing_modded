The British ambassador to Turkey Thursday indirectly expressed the hope that Turkey could participate in the European Union (EU) meeting scheduled for March in London, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
Turkey can profit from "some substantial profits" provided by the EU, David Logan told a press conference here, which was jointly held with EU representative in Ankara, Michel Lake.
Commenting on the present bitter relations between Turkey and EU, Logan noted that Ankara should not negatively evaluate the Luxembourg summit last December from an overall point of view.
He, however said that he understands Turkey's frustration over the EU decisions.
The EU leaders excluded Turkey from the ranks of the prospective candidates for the EU expansion process during the summit, smashing Turkey's dream of becoming full EU member state in this century.
In retaliation, Turkey announced a halt of political dialog with the European body to protest its "discriminative attitude" toward the country.
Observers here believe that Britain, which holds the term presidency of the EU, hopes it can persuade Turkey to attend the London meeting which deals with the EU accession issues.
In his part, Lake said that maintaining a good relationship is in accordance with the economic interests of both Turkey and the EU.
"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said, referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
Despite its compliant over the Luxembourg decision, Turkey has made it very clear that it would continue to develop economic cooperation with the 15 EU nations.
The EU is the largest trade partner of Turkey with traditional links.
Turkey submitted its formal application for the EU membership in 1987, but so far the goal has not been achieved due to its various differences with the EU, such as on human rights, economic problems as well as the Cyprus issue.
