The European Union is considering granting a second emergency aid to quake-stricken Turkey as senior officials of the bloc are scheduled to visit the country on Wednesday.
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, whose country is serving the rotating presidency of the European Union, and European Union Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek are to meet in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
They are to assess the damage caused by the August 17 earthquake, which has so far claimed a death toll of more than 12, 000 people in northwestern Turkey, and plans of EU's aid to rehabilitate and reconstruct the devastated region.
Last week, the EU granted a 2-million-euro (2.06 million U.S. dollar) emergency aid to Turkey.
The European Commission is to discuss on Thursday the granting of a second aid package which is said to be similar in amount to the first one.
The European Commission is also to discuss in September a more elaborate action plan to support Turkey, whose relationship with the union went awry after the union stopped short of letting it join the grouping among the first batch of countries.
