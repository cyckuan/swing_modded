Jose Cutileiro, Secretary-General of the Western European Union (WEU), will visit Turkey on April 11-14, the Anatolia news agency reported today.
Cutileiro will be received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and other high-ranking officials, Anatolia quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel as saying.
During the first visit by a WEU secretary-general, Cutileiro is expected to discuss with Turkish officials issues such as the security of Europe, the WEU's role in European defense and Turkey's contributions to the union.
Turkey is not a formal but an associate member of WEU.
