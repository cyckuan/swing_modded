The U.S. government said today that the European Union (EU) should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.
"Turkey is a European country," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
"We strongly believe that the European Union should allow the possibility of Turkish membership in the future."
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Some EU members insisted that Turkey is an Asian nation, not European.
"We don't have a vote in the European Union, nor do we seek one," Burns said.
"But we very respectfully think of Turkey as a European country and not send negative signals to Turkey."
Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), signed an agreement on Customs Union with the EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.
