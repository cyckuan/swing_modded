Turkey tonight accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to Turkey.
Like its decision on September 19, 1996, the European Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation between Turkey and the European Union (EU)," the statement said.
It urged the EU member states to show their " necessary reactions to this preventive attitude of the European Parliament."
The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU.
In addition, the European Parliament voted to review substantial financing for Turkey from the EU's MEDA Program, through which up to 842 million ECUs was envisaged for the bloc's Mediterranean neighbors in 1997.
