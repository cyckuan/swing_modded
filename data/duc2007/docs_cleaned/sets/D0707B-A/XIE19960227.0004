Turkey today welcomed the European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite Greek efforts to block it.
The EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday turned down a Greek proposal to adopt a common condemnation of Turkey concerning the two countries' dispute over an Aegean islet.
The dispute flared up last month when both Turkey and Greece claimed sovereignty over a set of small islands, called Kardak in Turkish and Imia in Greek, in the Aegean Sea.
The United States later intervened, preventing a war between the two NATO members.
According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between Turkey and Greece.
The statement added that Greece, despite its attempts, was unable to get the support of the other 14 European Union members in getting a statement that would express solidarity with Greece and condemn Turkey.
"Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14 members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the framework of customs union," the statement said.
Meanwhile, Ankara also urged the EU to release its planned financial assistance, a sum of 375 million ECU (483.75 million U.S. dollars), despite Greek attempt to block it.
"We expect the European Union to take the decision for the implementation of the financial assistance, an indispensable factor...in the customs union, as soon as possible," said the statement.
Reports say Britain and France have urged Greece not to force the EU into a legal battle with Turkey over the financial assistance.
Ankara maintains that the withholding of the assistance would be a violation of the customs union accord, which might go as far as to the European Court of Justice.
