The decision took political courage in a country where passions against Ocalan run high.
But it will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing internal problem.
Turkey is not obliged to follow the court's ruling, but has obeyed its decisions in the past.
Ocalan was seized in Kenya last February, brought to Turkey and tried for the murder of the more than 30,000 people killed in the Kurdish insurgency.
He was convicted and sentenced to death last June.
Ocalan has tried to bargain for his life by offering to broker an end to the 15-year-long Kurdish conflict.
He has also ordered his followers to withdraw from battle.
As a result Kurdish violence inside Turkey has sharply diminished.
Others with terrorist pasts, like Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Gerry Adams of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, have swapped violence for political bargaining and contributed to peacemaking.
Istanbul should give Ocalan a chance to do the same.
Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished.
Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984.
Ending that moratorium would be a mistake.
Turkey should not just postpone Ocalan's hanging, but cancel it.
