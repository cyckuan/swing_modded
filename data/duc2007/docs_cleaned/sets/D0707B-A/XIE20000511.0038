The east and central European countries applying for European Union membership are requested to inform their citizens about their move and the consequence.
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, requested the applicant countries to improve public knowledge and understanding of the union, to explain the implications of accession into the union, and to explain the link between the pace of preparations for membership and the progress of the negotiations.
The request was put forward in a communication strategy made public here on Thursday by the commission.
"The accession to the European Union of the central and eastern European countries gives rise to expectations as well as fears," said EU education commissioner Viviane Reding.
"The information and communication campaign launched by the commission aims to inform the European citizen, in an objective and reasoned way, of the stakes and the challenges of enlargement."
The commission also urged EU member states to communicate the reasons for enlargement to their citizens as well, to promote dialogue at all levels of society between policy-makers and the public on issues related to enlargement and to provide information about the candidate countries to promote general understanding.
The enlargement awareness campaign will run from 2000 to 2006 with a budget of nearly 150 million euro (139 million U.S. dollars EU enlargement commissioner Gunter Verheugen said on Thursday that the year 2005 is the latest to see the enlargement process complete.
He added that 10 of the 12 applicant countries are preparing for that date while two others are preparing for later dates, though he would not be specific on the dates the applicant countries would be admitted into the union.
