The Administration Board of Romania's central bank (BNR)has had made a number of decisions in connection with the introduction of the single currency in the European Union's member states beginning January 1, 1999, BNR director Adrian Vasilescu said on Monday.
Vasilescu said the central bank had decided that the rates of exchange posted by hard currency operators should also include the single currency unit.
The single currency will be also used in the reports issued by the General Directorate of Monetary and Hard Currency Policy, he added.
Vasilescu said the BNR would use the Euro money unit in printed matters destined for the mass-media.
The daily exchange rates released by the central bank would include the single currency, too, he said.
The new currency will affect only the Romanian businessmen in the Euro zone and those whose trade is dominated by the single currency unit, Vasilescu said.
According to statistics, the EU is the most important commercial partner of Romania, with the bilateral trade making up 60 percent of Romanian total foreign trade.
