The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted Indian banks to transact in the Euro, the new currency unit of the European Monetary Union (EMU), RBI sources said here Saturday.
The Euro will be launched on January 1, 1999.
In a circular issued to banks on Friday, RBI permitted banks to trade and invoice in the Euro, freely convert legacy EMU currencies into the Euro, and accept Euro-denominated bank deposits and remittances.
It also asked banks to ensure their information system's Euro-compliance.
The RBI has set up a working group to study the implications of the Euro launch.
Requests for conversion of existing deposits to Euro may be freely allowed and these rules apply to export earners' foreign currency and residents' foreign currency accounts, it said.
