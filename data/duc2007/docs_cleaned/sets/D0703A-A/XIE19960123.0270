Two recent Eurobarometer opinion polls showed that a majority of European Union(EU) citizens are in favor of the single currency.
Two representative EU-wide opinion polls, conducted between mid October and shortly before Christmas 1995, showed that 54 percent of citizens interviewed are for the European currency, 37 percent are against, 9 percent have no opinion.
Seven out of ten find the name of the Single currency "Euro" acceptable, almost one in four say the opposite, and one in twelve have no opinion.
About the future European currency, 20 percent feel "well informed", 79 percent feel to be not well informed.
In countries such as Sweden, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, more than 80 percent people feel to be "not very well informed" or "not at all informed".
