Europe's new currency, the euro, will rival the U.S. dollar as an international currency over the long term, Der Spiegel magazine reported Sunday.
Oil imports to Europe can also be calculated in euros as well as dollars, Duisenberg was quoted as saying.
``That which the Americans see as their automatic right, namely the financing of their enormous trade deficit by other countries in their own currency, won't be automatically acceptable any more,'' Spiegel quoted Duisenberg as saying.
The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect on Jan. 12, to be stable.
