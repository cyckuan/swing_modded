Britain's biggest mortgage lenders are planning to overhaul the traditional home loan ahead of a single European currency with the launch of euro mortgages.
Lending giants in Britain have put detailed plans in place for financial life in the country after 1999, when they believe European currencies will join in a single currency, the euro, with the UK forced to accompany them within several years.
Local press reports today said that the building societies have produced blueprints for euro savings accounts, passbooks and cash-dispensers despite the government's increasingly Eurosceptical tone.
This will mean substantial changes for our products, the housing market and the economy as a whole.
We have to look forward and be prepared."
Bradford and Bingley's plans for a euro mortgage are already at an advanced stage, and will be launched ahead of the UK's participation in the single currency.
Its chief executive Geoffrey Lister said, "We believe euro mortgages will be popular because they will offer lower interest rates than sterling mortgages.
We could even reach the stage where Britain remains outside the currency alignment but employees ask to be paid in euro."
