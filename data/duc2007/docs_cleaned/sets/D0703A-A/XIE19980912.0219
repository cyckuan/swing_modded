The mass printing of the banknotes of the single European currency, the euro, would be started at the beginning of 1999, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced in Frankfurt Friday.
The decision was made by the ECB's governing council during a meeting in Frankfurt on Friday.
Meanwhile the bank also decided to start this Autumn a test printing of the euro banknotes, which have a total of seven face values.
European Union's single-currency plan will take effect in 11 of its member states on January 1, 1999, when the euro will become a currency in the financial sense, but will first be used only in cashless tradings.
The actual banknotes and coins will be introduced over a six-month period starting January 1, 2002, after which the participants' present national currencies will cease to be legal tender.
Germany already started to mint euro coins early August.
