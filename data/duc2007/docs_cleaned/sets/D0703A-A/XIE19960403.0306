Despite skepticism about the actual realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January 1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already begun.
The European Monetary Institute, responsible for the preparations, has set up a consultative group of artists, art historians and psychologists to come up with designs.
The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released today that it has decided on two themes for the new currency: history of European civilization and abstract or concrete paintings.
The Euro is expected to have seven notes with face values ranging from five to 500.
The institute, which functions as a preparatory European Central Bank, began to invite tenders for making the new currency in February.
It hasn't been decided whether the Euro should include country emblems.
The Euro must also be counterfeit-proof and must include special designs to accommodate blind or poor-sighted people.
