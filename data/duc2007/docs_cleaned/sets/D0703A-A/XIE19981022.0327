Bulgaria has been working to link its currency, the lev, with the proposed European single currency, the euro, in a bid to speed up the country's financial integration into the European economy.
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of the euro, which is scheduled for January 1, 1999, the Bulgarian government adopted a system of monetary commission on July 1, 1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and the German mark.
Under the new system, one German mark is equivalent to 1,000 Bulgarian lev.
The mark has also been used for the settlement of foreign exchange reserves.
Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev has pledged that the lev will experience its connection with the euro automatically as the European single currency comes into use less than three months later, and that the entire process of transition will be accomplished by July 1, 1999.
With regard to easing the accounting, the Bulgarian government plans to print next year a new national currency, with a face value of one lev equivalent to one Mark.
Meanwhile, the euro will be used to replace the German mark as the accounting unit for Bulgaria's foreign exchange reserve.
