France has already struck one billion coins of the European single currency euro, which will be launched by January 1999, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Thursday.
Besides France, only Finland, Belgium and Spain have begun their production of the euros, but not as much as France, said AFP quoting official sources.
Germany is in "an advanced stage" of experimenting striking the euro, while other European nations which will join euro are due to begin producing the coin next year.
