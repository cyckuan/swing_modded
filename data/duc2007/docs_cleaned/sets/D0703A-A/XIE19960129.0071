The European Commission (EC) spokesman today formally denied newspaper reports that the EC is "secretly" drawing up plans to delay the launch of the single currency, the Euro.
"The commission firmly sticks to its position that the Euro shall be introduced in conformity with the (Maastricht) Treaty criteria and timetable which have been confirmed by the December European Council of Madrid," the spokesman said.
At the Madrid summit last December, leaders of EU member nations agreed unanimously that the European single currency will be formally launched on January 1, 1999.
