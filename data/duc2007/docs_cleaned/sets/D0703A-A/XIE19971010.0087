German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
As a result, they possibly wouldn't be able to do transactions in Euro from the day it takes effect.
The European Union member states are required to completely replace their own national currencies with the Euro from January 1, 2002.
