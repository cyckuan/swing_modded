Those who take interest in the single currency due out soon were offered from Monday onward Internet access to free information on the euro.
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European community, is responsible for this euro-related information program and the euro data will be updated on a daily basis.
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European economy and finance commissioner, told the press that the publication of key euro indicators on the Internet is an important initiative and the data provided will prove useful for the economic management in the euro zone as well as in the European Union.
The commissioner said, "The euro indicators will provide member states, the European Central Bank, national central banks, financial markets, enterprises, the media and the public with the latest Economic and Monetary Union statistics essential for decision-making."
He added that the statistics would be updated at noon every day, a significant improvement on Eurostat's service.
The single currency and employment were among the top three topics for which more information is desired by the respondents to a recent EU questionnaire.
The other top topic is the rights for being a European citizen.
