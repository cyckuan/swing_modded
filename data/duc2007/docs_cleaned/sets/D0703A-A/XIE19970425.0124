The European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body, today welcomed the decision by the Maintenance Agency for ISO 4217, the body responsible for the issuance of currency codes, to attribute the code "EUR" to the Euro.
This new code has been issued to allow progress with the technical preparations for the European single currency, scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999, said a press release issued here today.
The code is intended for use in any application of trade, commerce and banking which is based on uniform, internationally agreed representations of currencies.
It will allow currency users to identify the new currency easily.
The early attribution of the currency code will help economic agents, in particular financial institutions, in their preparatory work for the introduction of the single currency.
