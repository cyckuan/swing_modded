Thailand is considering using the European single currency, the euro, in the country's foreign reserves, the Nation reported Tuesday.
The Council of Economic Ministers of Thailand has ordered the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand to study the possibility as the single European currency is set to go into circulation on January 1 next year.
"If the euro proves stable, Thailand will use it as part of our international reserves," a government official was quoted as saying.
In addition, the council also assigned the Commerce Ministry to set up a group to work with state agencies, including the Foreign Ministry, to examine the impact of the euro on Thailand's international trade.
Moreover, a study on the impact on the country's investment will be undertaken by the Board of Investment while the National Economic and Social Development Board will join hands with the central bank to dig into the impact of the European single currency on Thailand's macro-economy.
The single currency will also benefit Thailand's import from the EU as it will reduce the operating costs of European traders.
However, the arrival of the euro is likely to reduce Thailand's trading volume with other countries significantly, the official said.
