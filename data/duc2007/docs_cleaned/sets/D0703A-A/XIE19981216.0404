The Romanian banking system is ready to perform services in the European single currency, the euro, the Rompres news agency reported on Tuesday citing sources from Romania's Central Bank.
"Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and the country's commercial banks fear little about the introduction of the euro and will easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest.
