(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) ``It was so weird.
It was really weird.
Like really weird.''
Monica Lewinsky's vivid description to Linda Tripp of an encounter with ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson.
This is ridiculous.
They're ridiculous.
We're ridiculous.
Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they scrolled across the newswire Friday?
Why was I eagerly sifting through the garbage of these transcripts and then sending choice snippets to colleagues and friends?
Just because you wear a red sweater does not mean you have to wear red lipstick.
I'm just trying to ... LEWINSKY: I wouldn't ever wear red lipstick to see him.
Good.
It ain't exactly Nixon and Haldeman discussing hush money and cover-ups, now is it?
Let's put this in another context.
If you were sitting in a restaurant and Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky were at the next table, having these exact conversations, you'd be rolling your eyes and yelping: ``CHECK!''
Picture it now.
Two unpleasant people, dominating and dragging down the room.
Tripp, sucking on a Marlboro Light and making a circular hand-motion to the waiter, indicating she'd like another vodka tonic for herself and a cosmopolitan for her friend; Lewinsky, seething quietly because they were supposed to share the creme brulee as a split dessert, but Linda totally monopolized the plate.
And they're yapping.
Loudly discussing Monica's older, married boyfriend, the one she calls ``the creep,'' among other nicknames.
They're obsessed.
Pathetic.
Annoying.
Obnoxious.
Juvenile.
And then I'm gonna wear the navy dress I wore to the radio address that still has the (REDACTED) on it for Thanksgiving.
Well, how you're what, you're gonna get it cleaned?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Well, I mean, like I haven't worn it for a year, you know?
Yeah.
It's about time.
Out with the old, you know?
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, that dress I don't care about pretty; I care about thin.
That's all I care about.
``Check PLEASE!''
Enough!
The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
Once again, expect the Clinton camp to emerge as the beneficiaries as the strategy backfires.
Once again, expect an odd groundswell of sympathy and support for the president and especially the first lady in the wake of this release.
Tripp's plotting and Lewinsky's whining does nothing to enhance the argument of those who favor impeachment.
In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous.
What, the country should be put on hold while government leaders hold hearings in which they'll rehash the minute details of stained dresses, cigars and sexual quirks and now these chirpy conversations about lipstick and ``beard burn''?
All those in favor of this entire mess going away forever, say ``Aye.''
All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry, unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.
