Under criminal investigation in Maryland, Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs specialist in the Defense Department's Manpower Data Center, two people familiar with the matter said Monday night.
Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at the Pentagon in a meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
Army Col. Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of defense information, confirmed the meeting, but said he had no other information.
Philip Coughter, a spokesman for Mrs. Tripp, declined to comment.
Until her tapes launched the probe of President Clinton, Mrs. Tripp was director of the high-profile Joint Civilian Orientation Conference.
The program for the secretary of defense brought together opinion leaders from across the nation to familiarize them with activities of all the military services.
Working from home since the scandal erupted, the 19-year federal employee has had a difficult relationship with her employer, declaring she wanted to remain at her work station at the Pentagon.
The Pentagon concluded her presence would be disruptive to the Defense Department, so she was assigned to put together a training manual from home.
She worked in the White House during the Bush and early years of the Clinton administration.
Mrs. Tripp's tape-recorded phone calls of Ms. Lewinsky discussing a planned cover-up of her affair with Clinton are the focal point of a probe by a Maryland prosecutor of whether she broke the state wiretapping law.
She says the probe is politically motivated.
Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and her sworn testimony to Starr.
