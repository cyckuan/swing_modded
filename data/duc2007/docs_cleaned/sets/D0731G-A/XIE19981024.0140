Maryland grand jury investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday, demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Joe Murtha said he would fight the subpoena issued in the Howard County, Maryland, grand jury inquiry being conducted by Maryland prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli.
He is examining whether Tripp broke the state wiretapping law.
Montanarelli does not have any tapes that Tripp made.
They are in the custody of Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
In order to build a wiretapping case, Montanarelli would need to pursue gaining custody of the tapes.
"This is an invasion of the attorney-client privilege and we're going to fight this all the way," The Associated Press quoted Murtha as saying.
The subpoena demands that Murtha appear before the grand jury and produce originals or copies of any tapes containing the voice of Lewinsky.
Tripp's other lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said, "This is another attempt by the prosecutor in Maryland to intimidate Linda Tripp and her lawyers and this latest step is further evidence of the political persecution of our client."
Tripp also is under scrutiny by Starr.
He is investigating whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
Zaccagnini said his client is still cooperating with Starr, as she has been since last January 12, but that cooperation would end immediately if Starr's office targets Tripp.
