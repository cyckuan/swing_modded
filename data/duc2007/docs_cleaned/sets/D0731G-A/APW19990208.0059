Linda Tripp, whose taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky sparked President Clinton's impeachment crisis, has agreed to interviews with NBC's ``Today'' show and CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
Mrs. Tripp's ``Today'' interview, a pre-taped talk with correspondent Jamie Gangel, will air Friday morning shortly after 7:30 a.m. EST.
She'll talk live with King in prime time the following Monday, Feb. 15, CNN said on Monday.
Mrs. Tripp, who worked in the White House counsel's office before being transferred to the Pentagon, befriended Ms. Lewinsky and got her to talk about her relationship with Clinton while secretly taping their talks.
She's yet to give an extensive interview about the case.
Gangel repeatedly requested the interview over an eight-month period, ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said.
It was Mrs. Tripp's choice to do the interview on tape instead of live, and Gangel will speak to her on Thursday, he said.
It's the second big interview on this story landed by ``Today.''
The top-rated morning program featured a Matt Lauer interview with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shortly after the scandal broke.
Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to speak to ABC's Barbara Walters first, but that interview can't be done until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr grants permission.
Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, was not available for comment.
