Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise money for her legal fees.
Mrs. Tripp, whose recordings of conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, is sending about 20,000 fund-raising letters ``urgently'' asking for contributions to her defense fund, The Washington Post reported Friday.
Her legal bills are already more than $325,000 and ``growing every day,'' Mrs. Tripp said in the 12-page letter.
She describes herself as ``David up against Goliath'' in fending off the attacks of Clinton's ``disciples'' and ``henchmen.''
Mrs. Tripp, who lives in Columbia, is being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for taping her phone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
Maryland law forbids taping another person without their knowledge and consent.
Mrs. Tripp earns $90,767 a year in her Pentagon public affairs job, according to The Post.
