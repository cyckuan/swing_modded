On one side are those who view the pursuit of Mrs. Tripp as a vindictive selective prosecution designed to punish her for exposing White House misconduct.
On the other side are those who take a dim view of her betrayal of the young woman she befriended and of Kenneth Starr's independent counsel office.
They see her current legal troubles as a matter of poetic justice.
Remove this emotional overlay, however, and the case seems more mundane a valid effort to enforce Maryland's privacy law, which prohibits recording telephone conversations without the consent of the person being recorded.
Ignoring such a well-publicized violation would have weakened the statute's deterrent value and made it harder for the state to justify prosecutions of less notorious violations in the future.
As for accusations of political revenge, the case was brought by a special state prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, who has a reputation for being nonpartisan.
It remains to be determined whether Mrs. Tripp's immunity agreement with Starr's office leaves room for the state prosecution.
The prosecutor must show that none of his evidence against her was the result of work by the independent counsel's office after immunity was granted.
That task was made easier last week when the presiding judge ruled that Mrs. Tripp's immunity applied only to evidence she gave to federal prosecutors after Feb. 19, 1998, rather than a month earlier.
The judge based that decision on a failure by Starr's office to get a court to ratify the agreement immediately.
The timing of the immunity is one of several legal issues that will affect the judge's decision on going to trial.
In fairness to Mrs. Tripp, an administrative error by Starr's office, if there was one, should not be the determining factor.
