Who can forget Linda Tripp standing in front of the TV cameras and assuring the American people: ``I'm you.
'm just like you.''
Just like who?
Not me.
No way.
Frankly, I don't know anyone who's just like Linda Tripp.
Linda ``Just Like You'' Tripp now stands accused of a crime, a minor one to be sure: tape-recording a telephone conversation without the other party's knowledge or permission.
But the ramifications were far more serious.
Tripp almost brought down the president of the United States.
Almost, but not quite.
Which must have been a tremendous disappointment for Tripp and her Clinton-hating pal, New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg.
It was Goldberg, as devotees of the White House sex-and-lies scandal surely recall, who advised Tripp to record those telephone heart-to-hearts in which Lewinsky revealed her sexual encounters with Bill Clinton.
The tapes bought Tripp 15 minutes of fame, a federal immunity deal with the independent counsel's office, an extended visit with Starr's grand jury and a long-term role as a punch line in Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show'' monologues.
They also bought her this criminal charge in the state of Maryland, which took exception to her violations of its laws against wiretapping.
Tripp, oddly enough, has been saying that she wants to stand trial because she remains convinced that she did the right thing when she pushed the ``record'' button on her tape machine.
Tripp's son, Ryan Tripp, attended Thursday's court session and was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that he wanted his mom to be tried so that she ``can be completely vindicated.''
Vindication, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder.
Linda Tripp didn't attend ``She's got to work for a living,'' Ryan said and so she missed the opportunity to stare down Lewinsky as the president's former, uh, girlfriend testified for the prosecution.
Tripp may get another chance to confront the former White House intern.
Lewinsky will be a key witness if the case goes to trial.
If the case goes to trial is a decision to be made by a judge, as we know, but just about everyone else is allowed to weigh in on another question: Should the case go to trial?
Tripp has her partisans I know this because I heard from most of them the last time I disparaged her in print and they insist that the criminal proceedings in Maryland amount to nothing more than retaliation for her participation in Starr's investigation of Clinton.
Can't argue with that.
But is the retaliation deserved?
Should Tripp pay some sort of price for breaking an obscure law en route to touching off a scandal that virtually paralyzed the U.S. government for more than a year?
Should she be held accountable for what may have been a massive betrayal of a friend's trust but was merely a technical violation of law?
Tripp is a despicable character, to be sure.
For my money, she's guilty of felonious audacity for making that ``just like you'' comment after her grand jury testimony last year.
Calling herself an ``average American'' was an affront to average Americans, most of whom would never dream of selling out a friend the way that Tripp sold out Lewinsky.
But only the most vengeful Clintonista could believe that Tripp ought to face criminal charges.
The scandal is over.
Clinton beat the rap.
Why dredge it all up again just to prosecute Tripp for, in effect, being a jerk?
