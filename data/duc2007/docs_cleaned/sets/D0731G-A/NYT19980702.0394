Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors, apparently explaining her motives for secretly recording 20 hours of phone conversations with her ex-friend and former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
Mrs. Tripp's lawyers and supporters presented the public with a freshly burnished image of Mrs. Tripp as an honest person motivated only by the truth.
In refuting the suggestion that Mrs. Tripp betrayed the trust of a vulnerable woman half her age, a person close to Mrs. Tripp's legal team suggested that Mrs. Tripp had tried several times last fall to end her friendship with Ms. Lewinsky, who would sometimes call and e-mail Mrs. Tripp ``20 times a day.''
Mrs. Tripp, 48, a Pentagon employee, had grown tired of Ms. Lewinsky's ``constant talk'' of her alleged relationship with President Clinton, the person said.
``Please give me a break,'' Mrs. Tripp wrote in an e-mail that she sent to Ms. Lewinsky last October, according to one person familiar with it.
The portrait suggests that Mrs. Tripp was a reluctant confidante who had grown weary of Ms. Lewinsky's attempts to discuss her relationship with Clinton and the attempts by lawyers for Paula Jones to quiz both women under oath.
Earlier this week, Mrs. Tripp told The Washington Post, ``I did not cultivate Monica she cultivated me.
Monica is a very worldly person.
She educated me.''
Two people close to Mrs. Tripp said she is disgusted by the suggestions in the media that she recorded her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky to try to write a book.
Shortly before 9:30 a.m., Mrs. Tripp, who was accompanied by two lawyers and a family friend, arrived at the federal courthouse here, saying nothing as she headed to the third floor grand jury room.
Her appearance was met with far less hoopla than her first day on Tuesday, when she was greeted by 300 reporters and a crowd of tourists and onlookers.
After the grand jury recessed for the day, one of her lawyers said that Mrs. Tripp was ``very encouraged by the quality and the content of the questions presented by the grand jurors and by the prosecutor.''
The lawyer, Joseph Murtha refused to say what questions Mrs. Tripp had been asked, but said that she would return, at a still-unscheduled date, to continue testifying.
``Over the past several days, many of you have asked the question, how is Linda doing?''
Murtha told reporters on the steps of the federal courthouse.
``Well, if there is any truth in the adage that an honest person's pillow is her peace of mind, I can assure you that Linda Tripp will sleep very well tonight.''
Mrs. Tripp is seen as one of the most important witnesses to appear before the grand jury in the five-month-old inquiry led by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Mrs. Tripp brought the 20 hours of tape recordings to Starr's prosecutors on Jan. 12, and told them that Ms. Lewinsky had encouraged her to lie under oath.
Commentators have said that her appearance is intended to send a message to Ms. Lewinsky that time is running out for her to strike an immunity deal and cooperate with Starr's inquiry.
If she does not, they say, she almost certainly will be indicted.
Mrs. Tripp, who has very low approval ratings in public opinion polls, is seeking support on her own web site.
In a note accompanied by her smiling photograph, Mrs. Tripp said, ``In the end, this investigation is not about left or right, it's about right and wrong.''
