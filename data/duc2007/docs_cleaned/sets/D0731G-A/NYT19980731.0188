She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response.
But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing herself off as a victim.
There are any number of people who could honestly claim that they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe.
Bill Clinton never asked.
Monica Lewinsky never asked.
The Secret Service never asked.
Even Starr never asked at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this country for six months.
But Tripp not only invited herself into this mess she started it.
It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved?
Maybe she's right.
She ``demanded'' to be involved.
There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the embodiment of the ``average American.''
``Well, the answer is simple.
I'm you.
I'm just like you.
I'm an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making.''
``I'm you,'' she said.
She's us?
She's an average American?
Here's a news flash.
Average Americans don't tape private conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends; they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root through their friends' sex lives.
The average American is not a scheming, back-stabbing, double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred for a politician than help a friend who's clearly in need of help.
Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid prevaricators.''
She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either.
But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her.
Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification.
No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
Linda Tripp is many things and those things are good or bad, depending on your point of view but one thing she is not is an average American.
And she is not a victim, though she has victimized others.
She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.
