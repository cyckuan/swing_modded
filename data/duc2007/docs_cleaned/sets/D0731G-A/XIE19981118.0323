House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The House Judiciary Committee released 22 hours of the tapes, which triggered independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Lewinsky case and led to his report to Congress alleging impeachable offenses by Clinton.
Prior to this, an edited transcript of the tapes was made public in October.
House audio technicians went through the tapes line by line to take out the same material removed from the transcripts.
Tripp secretly recorded the tapes of Lewinsky, talking about her affair with the president, and took the tapes to Starr, sparking his eight-month investigation.
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first witness on Thursday.
Tripp is now being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for allegedly violating a state law that requires all parties to a conversation to consent to any taping.
