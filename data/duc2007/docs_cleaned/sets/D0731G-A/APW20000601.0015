Maryland's wiretapping case against Linda Tripp came to an official end Wednesday as a Howard County judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the impeachment of President Clinton.
State prosecutors said last week they would ask Circuit Court Judge Diane Leasure to dismiss the case because of insufficient evidence.
Tripp was indicted last July for illegally taping phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
The tapes were used in the investigation that led to the impeachment of the president.
Leasure ruled in December that only one tape could be used in the case because of immunity granted to Tripp by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
Then, in May, the judge ruled that most of Lewinsky's testimony was tainted and inadmissible.
That left prosecutors unable to prove that the call took place before Tripp's immunity took effect.
