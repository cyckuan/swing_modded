prosecutor does not have to release a summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest court has ruled.
The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned a judge's order involving State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli.
However, public information law ``does not trump or override the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy,'' according to the opinion written by Chief Justice Robert Bell.
Tripp was indicted in July on charges of illegally taping a December 1997 phone conversation with Ms. Lewinsky and for illegally directing her attorney to disclose its contents to Newsweek magazine.
No trial date has been set.
The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
