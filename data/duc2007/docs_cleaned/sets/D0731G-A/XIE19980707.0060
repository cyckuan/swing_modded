Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.
Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a detailed account of her contact with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Phil Coughter, a spokesman for Tripp's lawyers, says he doesn't know whether this grand jury appearance will be her last in the investigation of possible perjury, obstruction and witness tampering.
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating an alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, said over the weekend that the grand jury has been asking a lot of questions and that Starr is moving the probe along as quickly as possible.
Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand jury.
The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
