The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Thursday.
Rather than the actual tapes, the Illinois Republican said, the committee may release an edited transcript.
In a series of conversations last year, Lewinsky told Tripp about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly, about attempts to cover it up.
It was Tripp's decision to give Starr the tapes that spurred an eight-month investigation that is now likely to lead to hearings on impeachment.
``Linda Tripp's tapes are very long.
They are very garrulous.
There is a lot of information that really does not pertain to this investigation,'' said Hyde.
``There is information there that really could be embarrassing to innocent people, third parties.''
``We don't want to alter tapes,'' he explained.
``On the other hand, there is information that should be released.
We can redact transcripts of the taped material and release those.
That, so far, seems to be the best way.''
Democrats on Hyde's committee questioned whether the real Republican motive was to withhold evidence that was damaging to Tripp's motives and methods.
``My suspicion is that if Republicans thought the tapes hurt the president, they wouldn't hesitate to release them,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. Nadler said he hadn't heard the tapes and noted that Starr's report indicated they may have been altered.
If there are questions of authenticity, the FBI should verify the tapes, he said.
``But it makes no sense to release the transcript and not the tape,'' Nadler said.
``You either release both or you don't release either.''
``Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda Tripp?''
``The Republicans started out saying they were going to treat the president like everybody else.
Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else.''
However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be consistent.

Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said withholding the Tripp tapes would continue the pattern of partisanship by the committee's majority Republicans.
Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes, Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony.
``And I hate Linda Tripp.''
Indeed, the grand jury testimony, e-mail and other evidence already released by Congress indicates that Tripp practically assembled the case before going to Starr.
It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
Lewinsky said Tripp ``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day.''
Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never happen.
But then ``she told me I looked fat in the dress'' and loaned her a jacket to wear to an event instead, Lewinsky recalled.
Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job.
Lewinsky said she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
Starr has raised suspicions about the audio tapes, noting that some seem to have been altered or copied.
Tripp has denied duplicating or altering the tapes.
It is illegal to tape someone without their knowledge in Maryland, and a state grand jury is investigating the case.
Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to release the tapes.
``The information that should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that shouldn't go out.''
