Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week, one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday.
Word of her scheduled appearance comes as special prosecutor Kenneth Starr tries to negotiate agreement for the cooperation of Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern who alleged in conversations with Tripp a presidential affair and cover-up.
Joe Murtha, a Tripp lawyer, said the grand jury subpoenaed Tripp on Thursday.
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly would not comment.
