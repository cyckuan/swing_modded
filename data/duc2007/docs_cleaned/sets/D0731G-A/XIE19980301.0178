Nearly half of Americans think Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has gone too far investigating President Bill Clinton, while about the same number feel the White House, too, has gone overboard by leaking details on people involved.
The poll also says, however, that 46 percent agree the Clinton administration is obstructing justice and has spent too much time leaking negative information about investigators and witnesses.
Fifty-six percent of those polled believe Linda Tripp's main motivation in secretly taping her conversations with Ms. Monica Lewinsky was to get attention or make money through a book deal.
