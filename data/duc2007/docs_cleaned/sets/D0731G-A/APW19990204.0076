Was that to go back and talk about the job again?''
Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but ... for me, the point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way ... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never disclosed that to the president.
So that was sort of my intention in meeting with Mr. Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little information and that would get passed on.''
``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel?''
Lewinsky: ``Yes.''
``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and your job search?''
Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing New Year's Eve.''
``Specifically about some notes that you had at your apartment?''
Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes.
That was really in relation to discussing Linda Tripp.''
Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I was acting on behalf of the President to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.
``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he asked others to help.
Jordan: ``The fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed were not of interest to me.
``You're acting in behalf of the president when you are trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the job search?''
Jordan: ``Yes.''
``And on either of these conversations that I've referenced, that you had with the president after the witness list came out, your conversation on 12-7 and your conversation sometime after the 11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case?''
Jordan: ``He did not.''
``Would you have expected the president to tell you if he had any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky would be called as a witness in the Paula Jones case?''
Jordan: ``That would have been helpful.''
``...
So it would have been helpful, and it was something you would have expected?''
Jordan: ``Yes.''
And yet, according to your testimony, the president did not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on two occasions, on 12-7 and 12-11?''
Jordan: ``I was keeping him (the president) informed about what was going on, and so I told him.
He was obviously interested in it.''
Jordan: ``Mr. President, she signed the affidavit, she signed the affidavit.''
Jordan: ``It is clear, based on the evidence here, that I was at the Park Hyatt on Dec. 31.
So I do not deny, despite my testimony before the grand jury, that on 12-31 that I was there with Ms. Lewinsky, but I did testify before the grand jury that I did not remember having a breakfast with her on that date, and that was the truth.''
Jordan: ``I am certain that Ms. Lewinsky talked to me about notes.''
``(So you) talked to her both about the job and her concern about parts of the affidavit?''
Jordan: ``That is correct.''
