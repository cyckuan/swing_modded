Some of the opinions are favorable.
Most are not.
It would appear that Tripp's claim that she's a victim of the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal didn't win her much sympathy.
And Tripp's assertion that she epitomizes the ``average American'' didn't go over with average Americans.
The letters and phone calls are still coming in, but readers so far have sided with me by a 3-to-1 ratio.
Actual ``average Americans'' clearly don't have much use for somebody who would tape-record private conversations with a friend and use the tapes to make the friend a target in a criminal investigation.
Which is what Tripp did to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who says she had a sexual relationship with President Clinton.
Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg who said she urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy teamed to expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky not to mention the accompanying media frenzy directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
Tripp was one of the instigators of the situation that is supposedly victimizing her.
She set out to implicate her ``friend'' Lewinsky and the president, even going so far as to brief Jones' attorneys to help them ambush Clinton with questions about Lewinsky when the president gave his sworn deposition in the sexual harassment case.
And yet Tripp stood on the steps of the courthouse after testifying before Starr's federal grand jury last month and declared: ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position.''
Describing herself as ``an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making,'' Tripp whined about her treatment at the hands of TV comics and ``legions of paid prevaricators.''
One reader left a message on the voice mail informing me that the column was ``way off base.''
One said the column was ``very bad.''
Tripp is ``taking a very bad rap,'' another said.
``After reading your opinion on Linda Tripp,'' wrote a Pennsylvania reader, ``it is obvious to me you are one of the 90 percent liberal media, reporting things your way and the hell with right, wrong or the USA.''
The naysayers were in the minority, however.
``This was one of the rare times that I've ever agreed with you,'' one like-minded citizen said.
``Right on,'' said another.
``Write more articles like that.''
``And this is an average American's point of view: President Clinton is on my time, right now.
Let him do his job.
And there was this from a reader in San Luis Obispo, Calif.: ``I thoroughly enjoyed your column on Linda Tripp.
Ken Starr was searching for a deceitful person to help him in his endeavor and he most certainly found one.''
All this taping was about a multimillion-dollar book deal, not the security of this country.''
Goldberg says that Tripp is not hawking a book.
But it's hard to believe that there won't be one, sooner or later.
So here's a question: If she writes a book, who's gonna buy it?
