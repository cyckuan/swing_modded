Maryland prosecutors have asked the federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported.
State prosecutors filed the request with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, unidentified sources told The (Baltimore) Sun on Saturday.
Maryland grand jury is considering whether Mrs. Tripp broke Maryland law by recording conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
If tried and convicted, she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Ignorance of the law is a valid defense.
Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House intern's affair with President Clinton.
In return, she received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution.
State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has tried unsuccessfully since July to obtain the tapes, which remain in Starr's custody.
Montanarelli must establish independently that Mrs. Tripp made the tapes and knew that taping Ms. Lewinsky without her knowledge was illegal.
Mrs. Tripp has declined to acknowledge publicly whether she made them.
