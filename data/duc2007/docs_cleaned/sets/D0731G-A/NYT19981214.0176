Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes.
``When that news got out, you could hear women gasp all over America,'' Traeder said.
``It was and still is a hair-raising thought: your trusted friend taping your phone conversations.
Most women consider their girlfriend relationships as sacred as a confessional.''
Traeder and her coauthor, Carmen Renee Berry, have learned a lot about women's values since ``Girlfriends'' (Wildcat Canyon Press), quietly invaded female America in 1995.
Now in its 27th printing, the paperback just passed the one-million-books mark and has spawned ``The Girlfriends Keepsake Book'' as well as a sequel, ``Girlfriends For Life,'' which will be published this spring.
``One thing you never know as a publisher unless you're producing someone like Tom Clancy is what book will take off,'' said Roy Carlisle, of Wildcat Canyon's mother ship, Circulus Publishing Group Inc. in Berkeley, Calif. ``Books that do become really big sellers always articulate some very powerful feeling that is right below the surface of the culture, something not quite in the consciousness.
``That pretty clearly is what happened with `Girlfriends.'
This thing of women's deep friendships is not a kind of fad; it's a serious reality for women in this culture.''
Before they collaborated on their book of essays, interviews and featured quotations, Traeder and Berry ``thought they were special'' because of the high quality of their female friendships.
Both women had been through periods of crisis, loss and change in the early '90s and believed they might not have survived without the love, understanding and support of their closest ``girlfriends.''
Doing the book and riding its amazing wave of success has shown the authors that they are not at all unique.
``Almost every woman has at least one woman she feels this way about: She's my support; she doesn't judge me; she's always there for me; I trust her completely; I tell her everything,'' Traeder said.
``The letters we've received about the first book just amazed us.
That's why we decided to do `Girlfriends For Life.'
People have written tomes, some five and six pages long, about their friendships.
They're really quite moving.''
Divided into dozens of mini-chapters such as, ``She's As Crazy As I Am'' and ``Helping Us Change (Even When We'd Rather Not),'' ``Girlfriends'' is not a deep book.
But it is as wide as the sea and just as accessible.
Reading anecdotes from other women tends to start a recall-and-analysis process for even the casual peruser.
``Everywhere we go, women keep thanking us for making them think about their friendships and see how blessed they are to have them,'' Traeder said.
Why, given the significance of our female friendships, has so little attention been paid them?
``We tend to focus our attention and energy on relationships that are more trouble the ones with men, our families, our kids, our co-workers.
When something goes wrong with a girlfriend, it's rare and it's really bad.''
Something like when your girlfriend secretly tapes your most intimate phone conversations, then turns them over to the feds?
``For many women, their girlfriends are the healers, the people who help them recover from life's blows, from dramatic changes and problems and bad relationships.
And Linda Tripp wasn't just a girlfriend, she was a mentor, an older woman Monica looked to for help and advice.''
As Traeder and Berry wrote in ``Girlfriends'' in 1995: ``By telling our stories, we learn about relationships.
These stories tell us how to treat each other what is acceptable, what is honorable and what is not ... With our girlfriends we peel back many layers of our personalities.
This process is an intimate and, we believe, sacred undertaking.
Anyone who has shown that willingness to expose their darkest secrets or greatest fears to another woman understands the treasure of a trusted girlfriend.''
And anyone who violates that sacred undertaking ought to be impeached from the human race.
