Associations for the unemployed in France announced Wednesday that they will hold another nationwide protest on Saturday.
Thousands of protesters demonstrated in Paris and other cities on Tuesday.
Four associations of anti-unemployment militants blamed the government for failing to present new proposals to tackle the 12.4 percent unemployment rate in France, and condemned France's employers for being arrogant toward the unemployed.
"The movement should continue.
Facing the arrogance of the employers, the silence of the UNEDIC (Union Nationale pour l'Emploi Dans L'Industrie et le Commerce), and absence of new proposals from the government, a dynamic should absolutely continue to find its place," said a communique issued by the associations.
The associations also criticized the Socialist government for refusing to revise its 1998 budget to raise the minimum unemployment aid the RMI, and to grant aid to unemployed under the age of 25.
