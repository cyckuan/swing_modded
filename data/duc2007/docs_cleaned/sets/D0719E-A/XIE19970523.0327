British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to tell his European Union (EU) partners that he would stand in the way of attempts to introduce higher social costs in Britain, according to British government sources.
At the special EU summit to be held in the Dutch city Noordwijk on Friday, Blair will say that although the new British government is planning to sign up to the Social Chapter, it is also determined to insist that the 15-nation bloc move to flexible labor markets, government officials said.
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on the May 1 general election, is expected to press the case for Europe to move towards the policies that have encouraged overseas firms to choose Britain as a base for investment.
The 43-year-old new British Prime Minister will tell the other EU leaders that there is a third way between the Tory-style non-intervention and the kind of over-regulation that is blamed for imposing extra costs and higher unemployment on France and Germany.
He is also expected to make it clear at the summit that he will not allow the Social Chapter to become a means of backdoor imposition on Britain of European legislation on social security and worker involvement on company boards.
An authoritative government official was quoted as saying today: "We don't want to lose control of our social security costs.
We would veto such extra costs being imposed here."
