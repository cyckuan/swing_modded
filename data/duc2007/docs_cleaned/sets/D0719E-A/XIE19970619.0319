the Euro, but stressed that other criteria would be strictly adhered to.
Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP, Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be softened.
Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999 launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing unemployment.
The Euro is due to be introduced from January 1, 1999.
Countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on full economic data of 1997.
But there remains widespread doubts about the future of the Euro because both Germany and France, the two country at the heart of the project, are struggling to meet the qualification criteria, mainly due to their sluggish economic growth and the cost for financing benefits for record high unemployment.
France has openly asked for a softening in the interpretation of the qualification terms of the Euro but Germany has so far insisted on strict adherence.
