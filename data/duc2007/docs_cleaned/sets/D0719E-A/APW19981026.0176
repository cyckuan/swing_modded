Transit workers were on strike in several cities on Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public transportation across France, officials said.
The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille, Lille and Chambery, officials said.
The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on Sunday.
On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45 minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout, officials said.
The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille bus drivers, who began returning to work Monday.
But employee representatives said they would halt service after each attack in France's second-largest city.
Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the northern city of Lille France's fourth-largest metropolis and for a 10th day in the Alpine city of Chambery.
Transit workers have demanded that the government put more police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the violence.
The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit unemployment rate.
While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods.
