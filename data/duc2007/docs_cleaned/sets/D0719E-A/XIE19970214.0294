The OECD report said that the labor costs for low-skilled workers in France are too high, and recommended that wage flexibility should be raised, including reforming the country's minimum wage system, the SMIC.
It suggests that the role of minimum wage "as a distributive instrument" be reassessed with the objective of increasing employment opportunities, and that the minimum wage be differentiated by age and region.
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
"Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system, replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained relatively high for low income earners," it said.
It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in France be solved through "making the country's benefit system less generous."
The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the flexibility of work schedules.
It said that the costs of mass layoffs and the time they take to implement are "substantial" in France, and that some collective agreements on employment contain "stringent obligations which can severely hamper the pace of restructuring."
It also regretted that while French enterprises can lay off workers out of economic difficulties, they cannot legally do this simply for obtaining economic benefits.
The report said that since 1992, the supply of part-time jobs has risen substantially in France, where part-time employment was underdeveloped by comparison with other OECD countries in the past.
It pointed out that working hour flexibility for full-time workers is "not as yet very developed" in France, even though the relevant legislation has been relaxed.
"Since 1994, agreements providing for greater flexibility compensated by an overall reduction in working hours have been allowed, but little progress in striking such agreements has actually been made," it said.
