The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84 million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry said at a press conference that the government will present a law on helping unemployed people before Summer this year, in which a series of measures will be taken in the fields of housing, health care and school.
She also promised to continue holding talks with unions and anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the government in favor of jobless people.
Meanwhile, the government ordered the local governments in prefectures to solve case by case the job problems of people living in distress, and asked them to maintain "emergency cells" responsible for tackling unemployment.
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population are without jobs.
Moreover, 36.89 percent of these people have been seeking jobs for more than one year.
Unemployed people staged a series of protests from Christmas through New Year festival by occupying the offices of government agencies in charge of unemployment insurance.
Since these emergency cells were set up by the end of December, 2,000 cases of jobless people in distress have been reviewed and 700 of them have been given "positive responses" on finding a job, said the government.
The government said that the number of jobs offered increased by 20 percent from November 1996 to November 1997, while the number of lay-offs decreased by 17 percent.
