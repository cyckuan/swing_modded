French President Jacques Chirac said Monday that the government should be ``particularly careful'' about the problem of social exclusion, which results from long time unemployment.
The social cohesion of France is now being threatened by unemployment, exclusion and violence in urban suburbs, the president said in response to escalating protests by the unemployed during a meeting with the press.
The protesters have vowed to continue their fight despite aid packages offered by the Socialist government to help jobless persons in desperate situations.
Chirac said the law against exclusion, which will be presented by the government to the National Assembly in March, will ``attack the roots of the evil in all fields,'' including unemployment.
He also suggested the government turn the money subsidized for social aid programs into investment for jobs.
France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been unemployed for more than a year.
