French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin went on the offensive Tuesday, calling for an increase in social allowances to end jobless protests and accusing President Jacques Chirac of borrowing his ideas.
The Socialist prime minister in recent weeks has wrestled with labor unrest, jobless demonstrations and discord within his government, just as the conservative Chirac has seen his popularity ratings soar.
In a radio and television interview, Jospin said his government has decided to raise two welfare allowances by 3 percent Jan. 1 to ease the plight of France's unemployed.
The increases will be retroactive to Jan. 1, 1998.
Jospin was responding to recent protests across the country by thousands of jobless demanding a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slight improvement in the country's high jobless rate.
Jospin said that Chirac, who has raised his profile in recent weeks, has ``borrowed a lot'' from his government, particularly regarding reform of the justice system, term limits and equal representation of women in politics.
Jospin also said that although his government is still targeting a 2.7 percent growth rate for France's gross domestic product in 1999, this goal will be hard to reach because of uncertainties on the world global market.
In 1998, he said, France will post 3 percent growth, ``maybe even 3.1 percent.''
Recent opinion polls have shown Chirac gaining in popularity and even beating Jospin in a presidential election with 53 percent of the vote.
Chirac, the leader of the moderate-right Rally for the Republic party, was forced to share power with Jospin, a Socialist, when he lost his majority in legislative elections in 1997.
