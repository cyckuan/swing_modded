Unemployment fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
The figure reflects a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
The improved figures were largely due to a gain in jobs by men aged 25 to 49, according to the Labor Ministry.
The October data was better than expectations.
Economists had seen October's unemployment level steady from September.
According to the Labor Ministry and to the national unemployment agency ANPE, the number of job seekers fell by 9,000, or 0.3 percent to 2.945 million people.
Job seekers aged 25 to 49 were the greatest gainers, with their number falling by 5,400, or 0.6 percent.
The number of women job seekers aged 25 to 49 declined by 4,500, or 0.4 percent.
However, the number of female job seekers under 25 rose 2,300, or 0.9 percent.
Among older job seekers, men aged 50 and over saw a slight improvement in their situation, with a 0.1 percent drop in unemployment.
But the number of women aged 50 rose by 900, or 0.5 percent, in October, compared to a month earlier.
High unemployment has for years been France's main economic hurdle, and remains so despite steady improvements since Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took office in June 1997.
