Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs (dlrs 535).
The jobless protest, which started in the southern port of Marseille, has spread to Aix-en-Provence and Martigues, where activists occupied a total of eight unemployment offices Tuesday morning.
In addition, about 15 jobless were protesting in an unemployment office in the Parisian suburb of Villejuif.
Meanwhile, police in Marseille evacuated two unemployment offices Tuesday morning, moving about 300 protesters into the streets.
Officials in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone region said Tuesday they would decide ``before Christmas'' on a way to obtain financial aid for the jobless.
They were to hold a meeting later Tuesday.
The movement is similar to one that took place in France last December, with unemployed workers demanding a bonus in order to be able to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one billion francs (dlrs 178 million) to help the needy.
Jobless activists say 15 billion francs is needed to help the jobless this year.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
