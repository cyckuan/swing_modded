The fight against poverty and social exclusion is considered by Frenchmen and Frenchwomen as the second most important issue of the country after unemployment, said a poll published by the newspaper "Le Croix" today.
The poll was conducted by the SOFRES polling group on August 28-30 on 1,000 people who are above 18 and from different social groups.
Fifty-one percent of people aged between 18 and 24 say that they think about poverty and exclusion from time to time, while 34 percent of people above 66 say that they never think about poverty.
Only 9 percent of the members of working class say they never think about poverty and exclusion.
Fifty-two percent of the polled say they personally know someone who is living in poverty or is in the danger of falling into poverty.
Six years ago, 49 percent of Frenchmen said they knew personally someone who was living in poverty.
Sixty-two percent of people say that to have five million poor people in France is something unacceptable, while 20 percent say that they feel "disarmed and powerless" in front of the problem of poverty.
Ninety-four percent of the Communist Party members polled say the state has not done enough for the poor, while most of the members of rightist groups and Catholic communities say the opposite.
Seventy-three percent people say that unemployment of long duration is the principal cause of poverty, followed by the lack of development of job market, and lack of solidarity among people as other causes of poverty.
