It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday.
``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr., chairman of the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon anti-missile programs during the Bush administration.
Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency'' on the matter.
The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14 retired officers and defense and political officials who served mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White House of failing to make missile defense a national priority.
President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve $6.6 billion over the next five years for program development.
The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy.
The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's 22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay tracking data.
Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19 billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American troops overseas.
Navy Capt.
Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department had no comment on the Heritage Foundation findings.
The Navy already has spent $1 billion developing a so-called theater missile defense system to protect ships and troops from regional threats, mostly from short- and medium-range missiles.
But it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a missile out of the sky.
In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy, the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise missiles.
It could take years before scientists and the defense industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, intercontinental missile.
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
Critics say the ABM treaty is no longer valid because it was negotiated between the United States and the former Soviet Union, not Russia.
