President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons.''
The stakes could not be greater.
The $60 billion system contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation.
India would probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost certain to follow suit.
Even Japan could be tempted to use its stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons club.
The argument for national missile defense is more compelling than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept.
Instead of trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of Soviet rocketry a clearly impossible task the system would be a defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state such as North Korea or Libya.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the system would not and could not be a defense against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of the mutually assured destruction concept.
Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost.
The first cannot be accurately calculated.
No one knows what rogue states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest it could act as a deterrent.
The effect on nonproliferation could be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60 billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund.
Members of the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys.
The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer has not been tested against realistic countermeasures.
There is no evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling shrouds on incoming warheads.
Plus, there have been no real-world tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
In addition, a missile launched against the United States would be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no doubt from whence it came.
No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
But there is no such thing in existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range missiles.
The true challenges of creating a national missile defense should be debated in the coming presidential campaign.
Research should continue on missile defense, and a commission of distinguished, independent scientists should be established to assess future tests against real-world countermeasures.
But for the present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option.
