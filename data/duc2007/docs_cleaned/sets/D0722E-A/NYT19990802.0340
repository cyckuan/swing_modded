In a second straight success, an experimental theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next year.
The $3.9 billion Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, has been plagued with problems, and it failed six earlier tests.
It intercepted its first target in June.
One failed test in March led the Pentagon to impose $15 million in penalties against the developer, Lockheed Martin, and members of Congress had asked the Pentagon to find another contractor.
Monday's test involved the missile's ability to hit its first target outside the earth's atmosphere as well as hitting a separated warhead for the first time, said Jennifer Canaff of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
Ms. Canaff said Monday's test was more difficult because the cooling of the target in outer space reduced the ability of the missile's infrared sensors to detect it.
Approved in the early 1990s, the program to create a mobile ground missile defense system against medium-range ballistic missiles would be used overseas, if it is ultimately deployed.
China has protested American plans to create theater missile defense systems with Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan to protect allied and American troops based in northeast Asia.
Several independent scientists questioned the importance of Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the results were going to be misleading.
``You've got to test against realistic targets that actively try to evade the defense system simulate real world targets and not just hit missiles on a test range,'' said Tom Collina, director of the arms control program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington watchdog group.
Officials at Lockheed Martin say those tests will come in the next engineering and manufacturing phase of development.
But the missile defense system must still pass one of two final tests to be held in September and next February before it can move to that phase.
