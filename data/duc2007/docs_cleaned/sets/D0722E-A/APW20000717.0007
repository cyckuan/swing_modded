Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, with a range of 800 miles, on Saturday.
Tehran is developing a longer-range Shahab-4, which it claims will be used to carry satellites into space and not for military purposes.
The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially deploy a national missile defense system that would provide protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to Australia.
The United States also would look to Australia to play a role in the missile defense system if and when it is approved, Cohen said.
Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Australia would consider a request for participation if the system gets the go-ahead.
But that expectation could prove unfounded if the opposition Labor Party wins federal elections expected by late next year.
Labor is opposed to Australian participation in the scheme.
The two countries jointly run the Pine Gap satellite tracking center in central Australia and that secretive facility would likely be used to track missiles as part of the U.S. missile defense system.
Moore said the agreement would be of particular benefit to Australia's troubled fleet of six Collins Class submarines, which have been plagued by technical problems ranging from periscope malfunctions to excessive noise and vibration, as well as problems in computer defense systems.
