prototype missile interceptor streaked into space on Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in California, but failed to hit the target, the U.S. Defense Department said.
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to develop a national missile defense (NMD) system.
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:19 p.m. EST (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed over the Pacific Ocean.
