The U.S. military today tested over the Pacific Ocean a sensor designed to detect and track incoming nuclear missiles, the Defense Department said.
The sensor, built by Boeing Company, located dummy warhead targets from a Minuteman-2 missile launched 21 minutes earlier from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.
Now in its initial test stage, the sensor is designed to be mounted on small rockets to collide with enemy nuclear warheads once they are identified and tracked.
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether to deploy it within three years.
Defense Secretary William Cohen has announced plans to spend an additional 2 billion dollars on the multi-billion missile defense program over the next five years.
