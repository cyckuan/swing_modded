The U.S. Army scratched Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a problem with the one that was to serve as its target.
The Army had planned to launch a Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile to knock the target missile out of the sky.
It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman.
The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit flying targets.
The system has cost at least 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
The Defense Department charged Lockheed Martin Corporation, the maker of the antimissile system, a 15-million-U.S.-dollar penalty for not achieving a hit during a March 29 test as required by its 15 billion U.S. dollars contract.
The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at least 800 miles away the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to U.S. troops and allies overseas.
The antimissile missile has technology that is the most sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to development of a system that could protect the United States.
