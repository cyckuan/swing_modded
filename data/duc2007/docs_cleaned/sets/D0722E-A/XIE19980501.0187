The United States Defense Department on Thursday awarded a research and development contract to Seattle's Boeing Co. to coordinate a missile-defense system, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced.
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack.
During the research, Boeing will design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for missile launch detection and communications.
They will be tied together with a sophisticated battle management control.
If the system works, the Pentagon could make a decision to deploy it in 2003.
The Pentagon said the value of the contract could eventually reach 5.2 billion dollars if the system works and moves towards deployment.
The NMD, emerging from former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, is to stop a smaller or accidental attack by another country against the United States.
The United States has spent billions of dollars on nuclear missile defense since Reagan put up his plan more than a decade ago, but little success has been achieved.
The U.S. military is also trying to develop an even more limited Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program to protect troops and bases from missile attack around the world.
But that program has experienced four successive failures.
However, Cohen said the United States was making "great progress" towards solving the technological problems involved in producing a national missile defense system.
