The U.S. military will conduct the eighth test of an anti-missile defense system in New Mexico State in the country Tuesday morning after seven successive test failures, the Defense Department announced Monday.
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with attacking enemy warheads in flight.
Tuesday's test, postponed two weeks ago when a target missile went out of control, will be conducted over White Sands, New Mexico State, missile test range, Pentagon officials said.
Despite the failures to date, Pentagon insists that much is learned from each test whether or not the intercept takes place.
The THAAD missile, designed to collide with and shatter enemy ballistic missiles, was not launched.
The Defense Department cited a number of reasons for the THAAD system's failures so far, including problems with the target-seeking system on the interceptor rocket.
