The U.S. Defense Department announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile.
The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and their staging areas.
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have "proven" that the missile works.
Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will enter initial low-rate production.
The Pentagon is scheduled to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars on THAAD so far.
Skipping the final flight test will save 15 million U.S. dollars.
Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts.
The missile had failed in its first six attempts to shoot down a mock warhead, but it recorded its first success on June 10 this year, followed by another August 2.
