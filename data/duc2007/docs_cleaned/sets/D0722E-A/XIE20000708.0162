prototype missile interceptor streaked into space on Saturday morning in search of a mock warhead launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California State, but failed to hit the target, the U.S. Defense Department said.
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's dive to develop a National Missile Defense (NMD) system.
The interceptor missile was launched from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg and headed over the Pacific Ocean.
