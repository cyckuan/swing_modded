The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today.
The restructure decision came after a six-month study of BMD programs led by U.S. Defense Undersecretary Paul Kaminski, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at a Pentagon conference presenting the review.
Kaminski said that some 450 million U.S. dollars will be added to the next generation of Patriot PAC-3 missile system and Navy Area Defense (lower-tier) system.
The first generation of Patriot missile defense system was widely used in the U.S. Gulf War operations in 1991 to knock down Iraqi scud missiles soaring into neighboring countries.
The U.S. Navy system is designed to have similar coverage but operates from Aegis cruisers.
Perry said that the development of the two missile defense systems will meet the need for countering potential short-range missile threats against the United States.
However, the study says that the Pentagon should not deploy a national missile defense system until 2008.
The Republican-controlled Congress has been pressing for such a system to be deployed by 2003.
Perry said that the Pentagon has planned to take some 2 billion U.S. dollars away from the BMD programs and to use them to buy more urgent military equipment such as tanks, jet fighters and trucks.
