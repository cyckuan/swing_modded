anti-missile missile failed Monday for the sixth time to hit a flying target, a defense official said.
It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile failed to intercept the target missile Monday morning, said Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army program executive office for air and missile defense in Huntsville, Alabama State.
"The telemetry data is still coming in and they're still analyzing it," Hunt said.
The test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for the THAAD missile program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a missile.
The system has cost 3.8 billion U.S. dollars so far.
