President Bill Clinton today voiced opposition to building a costly new national missile defense system that the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has been advocating.
In a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, Clinton said that the Republicans's proposal "would force us to choose a costly missile defense as long-range missile attacks on the United States is extremely remote".
Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters earlier in the week that the so-called the rogue nations could not build long-range missiles against the United States in at least 15 years.
It makes little sense to build a system now "before we know the details and dimension of the threat we face," Clinton said.
The U.S. Congress has insisted that the United States should develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003.
It has proposed to add billions of U.S. dollars to the Pentagon budget in the fiscal years of 1995 and 1996.
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained a national missile defense program, expressing concern that it could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia.
