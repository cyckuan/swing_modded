Revised estimates of nuclear missile capability, particularly of North Korea and Iran, add new urgency to development of a national missile defense system, the Clinton administration's top arms-control official said.
``Cold war disciplines are gone.
Technology is more widely available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, told a Senate confirmation hearing.
House Republican leaders were to rally on the steps of the Capitol today to applaud President Clinton's signing of a GOP-sponsored bill committing the United States to a national ballistic missile defense against limited attack, as might be launched by a small nuclear power.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems.
After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense system.
He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton administration policy.
The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are secretly doing so.
Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty, national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of Republican members of the committee.
The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few years ago, Holum said.
President Clinton vetoed an earlier bill committing the nation to a missile-defense system.
But in a compromise with congressional Republicans, he agreed this year to support similar legislation, the bill he signed.
``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy against proliferation,'' Holum testified.
Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to serve in the new post.
He had served since 1993 as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State Department.
The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador.
The administration says it will make decisions on details of a missile defense system next June.
Rather than blindly follow the ABM restrictions, Holum said, ``I believe our missile defense should be geared toward threat.''
