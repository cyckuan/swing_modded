Legislation approved Thursday by the House and sent to the White House would commit the United States to an anti-missile national defense system.
President Clinton was expected to sign the measure, which the Senate modified to meet administration objections.
The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic missile attack.
It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia on arms reductions.
Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000 on firm plans for an anti-missile system.
Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995.
He also opposed an earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear that the defense system would be limited and focused against threats from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers.
The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the House agreed to the revised version Thursday, despite some reluctance by supporters of the original House plan ``I'm not happy with the legislation,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chief sponsor of the House version.
The changes, he said ``are simply cover for liberal Democrats who don't support missile defense.''
Weldon and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said it should be clear that when the president signs the bill he is changing U.S. policy and committing the nation to a national defense system.
``The threat of ballistic missile attack is real, and it is here today,'' Spence said.
But Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system can be build.
``We ought to be very sober about any of these exhortations ... from people who want to wish this into existence.''
The administration has budgeted $10.5 billion between 1999 and 2005 to develop a limited national missile defense system.
It became more positive toward eventual deployment of such a system after North Korea last year tested missiles that flew over Japan.
The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars'' program, proposed by President Reagan in 1983.
Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state.
It would not be space-based.
