The U.S. military successfully tested an anti-missile defense system Thursday by destroying a missile with another one high over New Mexico State, the Defense Department said.
"It was a successful intercept," a Pentagon official said.
The U.S. Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile hit and destroyed a Hera test rocket in flight over White Sands, New Mexico State.
The success followed six consecutive failure attempts.
The THAAD is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with attacking enemy warheads in flight.
