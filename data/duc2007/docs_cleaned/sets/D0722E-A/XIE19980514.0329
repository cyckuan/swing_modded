Defense Department said Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile defense system despite five consecutive test failures.
"We're bound to have failures," Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Senate defense subcommittee Wednesday, a day after the fifth straight failure of test on the system.
Cohen said "technology can be very complicated."
But he added that Pentagon would press forward with the 15 billion U.S. dollar program.
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) failed to intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
"Preliminary investigation indicates that the THAAD missile lost control shortly after launch," the Pentagon said in a written statement.
"The missile impacted on the White Sands Missile Range about two miles north of the launch site."
The missile system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is designed to protect troops in the field from attack by Scud and other short- and medium-range missiles.
It is supposed to be an improvement on the Patriot missile system.
President Bill Clinton's budget request for missile defense seeks 822 million dollars for continued testing and development of THAAD next year and the House National Security Committee has endorsed that figure.
The Army wants to begin buying 40 interceptor missiles as a first installment on a system that is projected to cost 15 billion dollars to acquire and 18 billion dollars to operate over 20 years, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
India's nuclear tests in the last couple of days backed Republican lawmakers' call for a national missile defense system.
They cited India's nuclear tests as fresh evidence of the need for such a program.
