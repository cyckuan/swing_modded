The Pentagon's fifth missile defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the Defense Department said in a statement.
The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, was done at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
The missile, built by Lockhead Martin Corp., lost control shortly after launch, the statement said.
It appeared to be caused by a booster rocket problem.
The missile hit the missile range about three kilometers north of the launch site.
The interceptor missile and target debris landed on the missile range, the statement said.
The test at 7:20 a.m. EDT was the eighth overall for the THAAD and the fifth involving an actual missile flight and attempted intercept.
The THAAD system is designed to provide U.S. forces in the field protection from attack by Scud and other short- and medium-range missiles.
It is to provide broader defensive coverage than the Patriot missile system.
The program, emerging from former U.S. President Ronald Reagon's "Star War" plan 15 years ago, was to be deployed in three years if necessary.
