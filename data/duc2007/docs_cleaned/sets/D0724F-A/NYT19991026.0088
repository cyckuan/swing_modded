Americans are gobbling down more calories than ever, resulting in a 50 percent increase in the nation's obesity rate, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
Young people, the more highly educated and Hispanics are leading the way.
The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that 17.9 percent of Americans are obese.
In 1991 the proportion was 12 percent.
And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15 percent, compared with just four states in 1991.
Federal guidelines define obesity as being at least 30 percent above ideal weight.
For example, a 5-foot-9-inch person who weighs more than 220 pounds is considered obese.
Obesity is linked to many chronic and life-threatening diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.
Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine in Medford, Mass., reported Monday that 280,000 deaths a year can be attributed to obesity.
The CDC data, to be published in Wednesday's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that obesity was increasing fastest among 18- to 29-year-olds, people with college educations and people of Hispanic descent.
The survey did not find any significant changes in the rates of physical activity, indicating that overeating was the cause of most of the increase in weight gain.
Also in the same issue of the medical journal: Researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston report that young people who ate more fiber were less likely to be obese and have high blood pressure and high levels of bad cholesterol.
Fiber outstripped lower fat intake as being correlated with those positive health results.
Like other tests of leptin, which is linked to appetite regulation, the studies did not demonstrate a dramatic difference, although users did lose more than those who received injections of a placebo.
At the highest doses, obese patients lost an average of 15.6 pounds after 24 weeks.
They were also on a diet designed to give them 500 fewer calories per day than they needed to maintain their normal weight.
