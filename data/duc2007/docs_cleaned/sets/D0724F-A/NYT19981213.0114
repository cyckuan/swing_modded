On a recent Friday, Tyshon Young, 13, and a nutritionist strolled the aisles at Fairway in Harlem for a little comparison shopping.
He picked up a box of butter cookies.
She pointed to graham crackers.
He picked out frosted flakes.
She said Special K was a better choice.
He picked ice cream.
She told him to get the low-fat brand.
He wanted a mango.
She said he could only have half of one, once or twice a week.
By the time they made their way to the dairy section, Tyshon turned defensive.
High-fat, high-carbohydrate snacks like that have made Tyshon obese, which has triggered a form of diabetes once considered rare among people his age.
The trip to the grocery store was part of an elaborate effort to coax him into a new regimen of exercise and healthy eating that could save his life.
At 5 feet 6 inches and 216 pounds, Tyshon represents an alarming new health trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters with Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney failure, blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to amputation.
Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during middle age or later.
Although there have not been any national surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say they have observed similar trends among their own patients.
In the last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force.
``Ten years ago, we were teaching medical students that you didn't see this disease in people under 40, and now we're seeing it in people under 10,'' said Dr. Robin Goland, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, which opened in October at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in Manhattan.
Dr. Goland said Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 10 percent to 20 percent of the center's new pediatric patients, compared with less than 4 percent in the hospital's clinics five years ago.
``With the numbers we're starting to see,'' Goland said, ``this could be the beginning of an epidemic.''
Children with Type 2 diabetes look a lot like their adult counterparts.
Most are African-American and Hispanic, with a particularly high rate found among children of Mexican descent.
Most of the Type 2 children have close relatives with the disease, and almost all are obese.
In fact, doctors said, the spiraling rate of childhood obesity in America declared an epidemic last month by the U.S.
Surgeon General, David Satcher is the most significant factor in the rising numbers of children with this form of diabetes.
According to the most recent statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the number of obese children has doubled in the last two decades.
One in five children in America is overweight, researchers found.
Poor, minority children, who often eat a lot of junk food and have few neighborhood recreation programs, are at greatest risk, doctors said.
Obesity, by itself, does not always lead to diabetes, doctors say, but it is a major risk factor.
``If you want to make someone a diabetic, then make them obese,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, head of molecular genetics at Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center.
Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2 diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care physicians.
Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.
Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.
Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose use.
These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting their sugar intake.
In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it.
Many people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the disease because it can occur in the body for years without symptoms.
If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however, life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels, can develop within 10 years to 20 years.
``If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we aren't looking for it,'' Goland said, ``then we are going to start seeing complications in people in their 20s that we would normally associate with people in their 60s and 70s.''
At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart attacks complications from Type 2 diabetes.
The diabetes has also caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses.
Ms. Wilson, 5 feet, 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told she had Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors suspect she probably had the disease for years.
The delayed diagnosis, doctors said, likely contributed to her health problems.
``My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me.''
, many children with the disease can control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet modification.
Eventually, however, most people require oral medication and insulin.
``These are children who likely would have developed the disease at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it out early,'' said Dr. Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
``Losing weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly.''
Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2 diabetes.
Often they have parents who work long hours and cannot be home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods where fast food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber supermarkets.
Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes' home in Queens, there is a McDonald's and a Burger King.
``She used to eat at McDonald's every night,'' said her mother, Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons.
By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet, 6 inches, weighed more than 145 pounds.
Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first began gaining weight, the doctors told her the girl would outgrow the ``baby-fat'' after she passed puberty.
That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and began losing bladder control common symptoms of adult-onset diabetes and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor.
By adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to normal range.
But this year, Nuribel started at a new school.
Her mother said her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her health.
Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about her disease.
She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes, Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she.
``The sugar in her blood is getting high again,'' Mrs. Reyes said, crying.
Several small studies in cities across the country including Cincinnati and San Antonio provided the first data about the rise in cases like Nuribel's.
The researchers also found that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19.
And Dr. Kenneth Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area report that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes has increased tenfold in the last five years.
``We used to maybe see one case a year,'' he said.
``Now we see one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three cases a month.
It's pretty scary.''
Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy.
In addition to obesity and a family history of the disease, researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis nigricans, dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the arms or behind the knees.
Symptoms of the disease include frequent urination and chronic thirst.
Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed.
He had pains in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision.
But, his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong with him.
They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him on Prozac, and urged her to insist that he stay in school.
``They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle cell,'' his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, ``but no one tested him for diabetes.''
Then, Nigel, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 250 pounds, began vomiting two or three times a day.
One morning, he could hardly stand and his vision was completely blurred.
Emergency room doctors discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to 8 times higher than normal.
He spent nearly a week in intensive care.
Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter.
He takes two insulin shots a day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores.
Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hope to get the teen-ager off insulin soon.
At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of worries about what lies ahead.
``This disease is probably going to really mess me up,'' he said.
``Eventually everyone succumbs to the disease.''
Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral medications and sometimes the same pills are used in children, however none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric patients.
In the next month, several clinics across the country will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2.
In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia's medical school.
Opened in October, the Berrie center is different from many other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy.
Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff.
They make house calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating.
And they conduct regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday afternoon trip with Tyshon.
``If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment, we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,'' Goland said.
In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin.
At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds.
Tyshon, his mother and his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled.
``Nothing is off limits to you,'' she said, urging Tyshon to stick with his new eating habits.
``But you have to eat in moderation.
Small changes can make a big difference.''
