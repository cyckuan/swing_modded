In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust, many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from work going on at a frantic pace and amid much secrecy in biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the body's weight control system.
While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.
Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping people lose weight and keep it off.
What's more promising, say West and other gene scientists are drugs targeted to specific genetic switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and energy in balance.
Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research.
Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores.
The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity.
But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system.
``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development,'' Dr. Karen Moore, Millennium's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week.
``In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it, The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.
Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system.
``The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in combination with environmental factors.
The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's health some 55 percent, or 97 million of Americans are overweight and obese but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.
This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese.
The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th person.
Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating.
So, the reasoning went, give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight.
Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers.
Moreover, it's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin: it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting to the right receiving station.
Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance.
Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so far.
Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough, because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis.
How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody's guess.
``We don't know the final chapter we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says Stern.
However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the genes we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion'' for the overweight.
