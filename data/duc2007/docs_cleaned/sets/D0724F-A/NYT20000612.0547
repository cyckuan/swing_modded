Americans are getting fatter and health specialists are getting frustrated.
``We don't make it a priority in our culture to eat well,'' said Anne Rogan, a professor of nutrition at the Sage Colleges.
That helps explain why the number of overweight adult Americans continues to grow.
Today, more than half of all Americans are considered too heavy, up from about 25 percent in 1980.
Those alarming statistics set the stage two weeks ago for the first Nutrition Summit in 31 years and the release of new federal dietary guidelines.
While no one is expecting any overnight miracles, the goal is to focus attention on the problem of obesity in this country.
Ironically, the first nutrition summit, in 1969, was aimed at reducing hunger and malnutrition.
``The scales aren't lying.
We have a serious weight problem,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said at the opening of this year's summit.
Concern about expanding waistlines is also at the heart of new dietary guidelines published in May.
Revised every five years, the guidelines are meant to incorporate the latest advances in medical and scientific research while giving the country a dietary blueprint to follow.
For most Americans, the ``Food Guide Pyramid'' is the most recognizable symbol of those guidelines, spelling out the recommended number of daily servings of vegetables, dairy, grains, meat and fruit.
For the first time, the guidelines emphasize physical activity, recommending at least 30 minutes of daily exercise for adults and 60 minutes for children.
Stephanie DiBacco, the assistant director of patient services at the Albany Medical Center, especially likes those specific suggestions, as well as new language in the guidelines about the importance of eating whole grains, such as oatmeal, barley or brown rice.
``They make a far greater attempt this time to support whole grains, fruits and vegetables,'' she said.
Yet DiBacco, like most nutrition experts, is realistic.
She knows most people don't consult the guidelines before opening the refrigerator door, especially those recommendations that call for moderation in portion size and sugar intake.
``Moderation is such an ugly word for Americans,'' she said.
Not everyone, however, is happy with the new guidelines.
``They really aren't strong enough,'' said Patricia R. Bertron, a New Jersey registered dietitian and a consultant with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group based in Washington that emphasizes preventive medicine and good nutrition.
``Americans, as a whole, are in the worst shape they've ever been.''
The group takes exception to the recommended daily servings of dairy and meat.
``They're the primary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet,'' she said.
``They really should be pushing the health benefits of a plant-based diet.''
Although PCRM encourages a vegetarian diet, not everyone has to make such a drastic change to reap the health benefits of eating more grains, legumes and vegetables.
One simple way to do that is to think of the 10 meals you make most often in your home.
Bertron proposes making at least three of those meals vegetarian.
For example, if you eat spaghetti with meat sauce, make it just spaghetti with tomato sauce.
Besides looking at three meals you can change, she also suggests coming up with three new vegetarian recipes.
Ultimately, guidelines are only guidelines, and the daily decision of what and how much to eat is an individual choice.
If anything, nutritionists hope people will think about those decisions before a health problem, like heart disease or obesity, comes up.
``Americans have to hear the message over and over again,'' DiBacco said.
Aim for a healthy weight.
Be physically active each day.
Let the Pyramid guide your food choices.
Choose a variety of grains daily, especially whole grains.
Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables daily.
Keep food safe to eat.
Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat.
Choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of sugars.
Choose and prepare foods with less salt.
If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.
Choose whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes to meet nutrient needs.
Avoid animal fats and hydrogenated oils (solid shortenings).
Choose and prepare foods with little or no added sugar.
Choose and prepare foods with little or no added salt.
If you drink alcoholic beverages, use should generally be less than one drink per day for women and less than two drinks per day for men.
