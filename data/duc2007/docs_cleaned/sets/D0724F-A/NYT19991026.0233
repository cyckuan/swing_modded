More than half of all adults in the United States 54.9 percent are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent of adults who are obese, CDC said.
From 1991 to 1998, the proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal body weight doubled.
That means, according to state public health experts, that almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.
``Obesity is a serious health condition, and it is occurring at an epidemic level,'' Dr. Jeffrey Koplan said.
``Overweight and physical inactivity account for more than 300,000 premature deaths each year, second only to tobacco-related deaths.''
Excess weight is increasing as rapidly in the population as an infectious disease might spread, and should be treated as seriously as an epidemic, Koplan said.
He presented new research by CDC scientists at a Los Angeles conference hosted by the American Medical Association.
The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a special issue today devoted to obesity and overweight.
The problem is particularly acute in Georgia.
Although rates of obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the most in Georgia, according to CDC's research.
In 1991, 9.2 percent of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr. Kenneth Powell, an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health.
``We're also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2 percent every year for the past 15 years.
The combination of eating too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our overweight and obesity levels up.''
The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down fat, take action'' that is, increase fruits and vegetable servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular exercise.
Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
BMIs of 30 and above are considered obese.
BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard for overweight lower in effect, reclassifying as overweight an additional 29 million Americans.
Under the old guidelines, men with a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
The researchers found: Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, compared to 43 percent in 1962.
(Both percentages reflect the new weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an apples-to-apples comparison. )
Almost one-fifth of all adults are now obese, defined as being more than 30 percent above ideal weight.
Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults, college graduates and Hispanics.
If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on the U.S. health care system.
To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation has directed against tobacco in recent years.
``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said.
``For both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these conditions.
(But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was considered a social issue, not a health issue.
Similarly, we need to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a health issue.''
There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in 1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
According to researchers from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert placebo.
Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100 participants lost.
The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as opposed to muscle tissue.
There appeared to be no adverse effects on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which was partially supported by Amgen, Inc., a pharmaceutical company that synthesizes leptin.
