Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday.
Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr. William H. Dietz, director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
``We're on our way to solving the tobacco problem.
The next major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health Association.
To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds and the difficulty in shedding them.
Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of 10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz has calculated but not yet published.
The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time period.
35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day, according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana provides about 80 calories.
In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years, adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height measurements, according to Dietz.
The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and height charts.
The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of other children of the same age.
``That's a big deal,'' Dietz said.
In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional problems.
Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras, director of Pediatric and Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public Health, presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts children under the age of five in the government nutritional program Woman, Infants, and Children.
More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels, an indication of anemia, while the percentage of children who were overweight was more than twice as high as expected, 10.5 percent.
Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight.
Preliminary 1997 figures, to be released in the next couple of months, suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight children in WIC, but the numbers for low hemoglobin, short stature, and being under weight appear to be holding steady, Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview.
