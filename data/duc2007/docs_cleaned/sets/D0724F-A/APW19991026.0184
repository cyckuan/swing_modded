where meals are often finger-lickin' good and steamy summers lead to days of lounging inside -- is leading the way.
In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that time frame.
Georgia led the nation with a 101.8 percent increase.
The more likely reason for the increase in portliness below the Mason-Dixon line is a lack of exercise.
Southerners are less likely to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a health club than their counterparts in the rest of the nation, according to Georgia's Division of Public Health.
The lowest obesity rates were in New England and in the West, where people are more active.
Even there, though, obesity rates are on the rise.
Some blame Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot for people to get outside.
``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,'' said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness center.
``They go in and find air conditioning.''
Others, including Dr. William Dietz, one of the study's co-authors, blame the design of modern suburbs.
Dietz points out that the sprawl around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars for hours, encourages them to eat greasy fast food and prevents them from having enough time to exercise.
The period measured in the study coincides with a time of rapid population growth around Atlanta.
In 1991, Georgia had one of the lowest obesity rates in the country.
``Atlanta is not a walkable community,'' said Pam Wilson, a dietitian with Georgia's division of public health.
``We don't have sidewalks that lead anywhere.''
The CDC study, announced Tuesday at the AMA's annual Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991 and '98.
Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases.
But the study found ``a steady increase'' in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races and educational levels; and regardless of smoking status.
Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.
The study was to be published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, along with other studies on obesity.
Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said a national strategy is needed to combat obesity.
``In general, restoring physical activity to our daily routines is critical,'' he said.
