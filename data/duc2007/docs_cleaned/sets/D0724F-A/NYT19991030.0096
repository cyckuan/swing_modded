Take the room service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md.
If you order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels, orange juice, a banana and strawberries a meal with at least 1,000 calories.
Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average number of calories year by year.
And the percentage of adults who claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991 to 1998, at about 29 percent.
The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year.
More than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese more than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official medical measure of fatness.
(Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30.
Your body mass index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of your height in feet.)
And obesity is not just a social stigma it is associated with poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder disease.
To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust.
In a preliminary study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little or no weight one fat person who took the highest dose actually gained 20 pounds.
Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future could hold more bad news.
Others say there may in fact be a magic bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular biology.
And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that has proved so disappointing.
The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating.
Every time it seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more weight.
These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less exercise.
The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise.
It also called for a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths.
If the nation can mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and environmental components analogous to those already in place for tobacco use,'' the journal said.
Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat people lose interest in eating to excess.
Perhaps the drugs should be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat people who cannot control their weight.
The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as part of a natural weight control system.
As such, it has revealed molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely targeted weight loss drugs.
``This is my prediction,'' said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, who is deputy director of the obesity research center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent leptin study.
``We are going to be able to turn off appetite completely eventually.
The therapeutics will be sophisticated enough to stop people from eating.''
He added that while there are certainly social and environmental influences on body weight people who live in Southern states tend to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter eventually obesity will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels.
Those who cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a pill.
``Seven or eight years ago, the first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular discovery.''
With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People were shocked.''
That discovery came when scientists reported that leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin.
The next year, the hormone was found in people.
At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat people and they will get thin.
But it turned out that overweight people make plenty of leptin.
Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
These people eat voraciously one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000 calories at a sitting.
When several of these people were treated with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal the brain that there is fat on the body.
