This week, the second national nutrition summit found a twofold problem: hunger and obesity.
Combating the latter is complex, and Washington is doing less than it could to improve American diets.
In three decades, much progress has been made in getting food to those who need it.
Still, a combination of high housing costs, the unevenness of the economic boom's benefits, and restrictions on food stamps and other programs forces many Americans to ask for help in finding their daily bread.
In a survey of mayors last year, 85 percent reported that requests for emergency food assistance had grown, by an average of 18 percent.
At the same time, the nation's other great nutrition problem is obesity, now reaching epidemic proportions.
One fifth of all Americans are obese, raising their risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
Several sessions of this week's summit explore how schools, employers, restaurants, and the media can change the patterns of eating and inactivity that lead to obesity.
The summit took place just days after the government updated its dietary guidelines, as it does every five years, and for the first time specifically recommended exercise to help avoid obesity.
But the government caved in to the sugar industry by rejecting language favored by its own panel of scientists calling on consumers to ``limit'' sugar intake.
Instead, the guidelines say Americans should ``moderate'' their sugar consumption.
The wording change followed a massive lobbying effort by the sugar processing industry, which has contributed $1.2 million to senators since 1995.
In March, 30 senators signed a letter making the extraordinary argument that there is no proven link between sugar and obesity.
Government was a public health leader in pointing to the obvious relationship between cigarettes and cancer, when the tobacco industry was raising bogus questions about scientific proof.
Now, government can't seem to connect a candy bar with an unhealthy paunch.
