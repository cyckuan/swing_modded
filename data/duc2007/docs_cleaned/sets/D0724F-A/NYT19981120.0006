Despite its chic, sleek image, Los Angeles is fatter than you might think.
That's right: 47 percent of Los Angeles County adults are overweight, and 14 percent are severely overweight, according to an unprecedented county health poll released Thursday.
In between bites of a burger, 45-year-old Don Como, a former vegetarian, said the findings are alarming, but predictable.
``It's really not surprising when you think of all the fast food that's around that you can't help eating,'' said the resident of Woodland Hills, an L.A.-area suburb.
But while nearly half of Angelenos are carrying extra pounds and are at increased risk for health problems, we're not as heavy as Americans nationwide, 54 percent of whom are overweight.
``The good news is we're a little better than the nation as a whole,'' said Jonathan E. Fielding, Los Angeles County director of public health.
``But I think the most important news is that one out of two California adults is overweight or extremely overweight.
And that is costing everybody in terms of health and in terms of dollars.''
Overweight people have a heightened risk for such ailments as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, Fielding said.
The survey was based on telephone interviews with 8,000 households last year, during which researchers calculated whether adults are overweight by using the body mass index.
The index measures the ratio of weight to height.
Using that formula, the National Institutes of Health recently revised its definition of obesity downward, putting more Americans in the overweight category.
Using the new standards, the county survey found that 55 percent of men and 39 percent of women in L.A. are overweight.
African-Americans have the highest rate of obesity at 58 percent and Asian-Americans have the lowest, 25 percent.
Latinos, 54 percent, and whites, 44 percent, fall in between.
African-American and Latino cultures attach less stigma to extra weight than does white culture, and men have long been immune from the thinness pressure applied to women, said Morton Maxwell, director of the UCLA University Obesity Center.
``All of us men love our big bellies sticking out, because no one tells us we don't look good,'' he said.
Joel Forte and Mark Smith, watching their children at soccer practice at Warner Park in Woodland Hills, said the overweight rate wasn't surprising.
``I'm surprised that it's that low,'' said Forte, 37, of Canoga Park.
Then he looked at an index chart and gasped.
``Wow!
I'm overweight!''
``They make everybody overweight,'' protested Smith, 30, of Woodland Hills.
To fall within acceptable bounds, said the 5-foot-9, 189-pound Smith, ``You'd have to be a string bean.''
Their surprise echoed the complaints of Sally Smith, spokeswoman for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance in Sacramento, who said the survey results are likely to prompt ineffective ``yo-yo'' dieting.
``It's unrealistic of them to believe that by proclaiming people overweight, people will automatically become thin,'' she said.
Obesity and nutrition specialists acknowledge that the body mass index doesn't infallibly measure muscle mass or body fat levels the real gauges of health.
Nevertheless, they emphasized that it provides a good indication of obesity across a population.
``If it was based on scientific evidence,'' he said, ``it would be set lower.''
