and are paying for it with soaring rates of obesity.
According to statistics accumulated by the California Department of Health Services, nearly half of Californians who ate out on an average day chose a fast-food restaurant, up from one- third in 1989.
And the number of Californians who are overweight or obese jumped 50 percent between 1984 and 1997.
What's more, the rate of diabetes rose 25 percent during the same period.
Obesity is a known risk factor for adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
"In California, it's expected that approximately 35,000 people will die this year from illnesses related to poor diet and physical inactivity," Dr. James W. Stratton, a state health officer, predicted Most Californians polled blame aggressive television advertising for their poor food choices, according to the report.
The new study is based on two surveys.
Dietary habits were assessed by telephone surveys conducted every other year starting in 1989, while information on weight and physical activity came from a separate yearly report conducted every year since 1984.
