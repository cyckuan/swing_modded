Two studies published this month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the substantial health risks of obesity.
Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
According to Policy Analysis Inc., a health economic research firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion dollars annually.
In these studies, obesity was measured in terms of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese ( BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2) of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese.
Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese.
The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
The likelihood of developing coronary heart disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000 persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.
