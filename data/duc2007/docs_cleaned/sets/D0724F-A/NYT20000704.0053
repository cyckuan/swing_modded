Food In The News: Giant Food Portions Equal Giant People The culprit behind America's weight problem may not be what we eat but how much we eat.
Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a leading cause of obesity.
Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link between diet and cancer.
Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002.
If exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of 15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
French fries from McDonald's offer a clear example of the phenomenon.
An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26 grams of fat.
When the company began selling french fries in the 1950s, a small order the only one available had 220 calories and 12 grams of fat.
The institute also recently surveyed croissants , quesadillas and bagels, popular American foods adopted from other countries.
In each case, the item grew in size and calories when it was adapted for the American market.
The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference.
The typical American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures 181/2 inches.
And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar and fat, Polk says.
The bagel, seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast pastries, has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe.
Even in its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its European cousins about 11/2 to two ounces.
But today some bagels have more than doubled in size.
National bagel-maker Lender offers a 41/2-ounce ``Big and Crusty'' bagel; Dunkin Donuts' plain bagel is four ounces.
And people rarely eat bagels plain.
Adding fat-laden spreads like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content.
And the bigger the bagel, the more spread it can take.
Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their immigration from Mexico, Polk says.
Small corn tortillas filled with potato, cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico, and cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other parts.
But in America, the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour tortilla filled with cheese.
Polk estimates the typical American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70 grams of fat.
In other studies, nutritionists and researchers are nudging out the concept of ``bad foods'' like soda and fat in favor of focusing on the huge portion issue.
Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared, carbonated soft drinks than than children who weren't overweight, and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children's diets.
``If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood obesity, then we should point our fingers at the real culprits huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity,'' says Maureen Storey of the Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition Policy.
Calls to eliminate certain foods isn't a practical way to help children or adults lose weight, she says.
``We should get over this good food-bad food silliness and move on.''
