Obesity is a U.S. epidemic that has surged in the past decade and now affects nearly one in five adults, killing some 300,000 a year, a collection of new studies suggest.
``Obesity is a major cause of mortality in the United States,'' concludes one of the surveys.
In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study.
That data, which was to be announced today at the AMA's annual Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98.
Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' the study found.
Overall, the population of obese men and women increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.
Other recent research has found that more than 50 percent of Americans are overweight and 22 percent are obese, even though weight-loss products and services are a $33 billion-a-year industry.
Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.
The figures were adjusted for sex, age and whether the subjects smoked but did not factor in chronic disease or family histories that might indicate a predisposition to an illness.
An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity.
Growth in the marketing of fast food and snack food, as well as lack of exercise, are among the reasons Americans are taking in more calories than they burn, the editorial concluded.
``Children watch more television daily, physical education has been markedly reduced in our schools, many neighborhoods lack sidewalks for safe walking, the workplace has become increasingly automated, household chores are assisted by labor-saving machinery, and walking or bicycling has been replaced by automobile travel,'' the editorial said.
