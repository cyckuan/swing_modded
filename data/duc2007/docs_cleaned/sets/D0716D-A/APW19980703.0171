More than 100 protesters were arrested Friday after overwhelming police and storming onto the site of a proposed new uranium mine in Australia's north, police said.
About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles (300 kms) east of Darwin.
About 180 protesters climbed a security fence and walked onto the construction site, said spokeswoman Megan Kinninment.
``They were reclaiming the lease for the traditional Aboriginal owners of this land, the Mirrar people, who have been opposed to this mine from the start,'' she said.
Police Superintendent Gary Smith said dozens of protesters stampeded over police on their way to the site, elbowing officers out of the way.
Police were considering laying assault charges against the demonstrators.
Construction of the Jabiluka mine Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
Almost 100 arrested protesters had been taken to Darwin because the jail at the nearby town of Jabiru was not big enough, Smith said.
