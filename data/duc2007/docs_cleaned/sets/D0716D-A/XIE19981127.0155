The Australian government's criticism of a report on the Kakadu National Park was extraordinary, head of the World Heritage mission to Kakadu, Francesco Francioni, said Friday.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead anyway.
The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee Bureau meeting in Kyoto.
While talking over ABC Radio from Tokyo, Francioni rejected Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions.
He said the recommendations were designed to remove real and potential dangers from one of Australia's most famous national parks.
He said the majority of the drafting group reflected the views of the report.
The World Heritage convention was supposed to be an instrument of cooperation and not a forum for adversary politics, he said.
The Australian government has already insisted that Jabiluka remain open, which would almost certainly see Kakadu placed on the endangered list if the World Heritage Committee accepts the report of its mission to Australia.
