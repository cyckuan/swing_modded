Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize.
The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world.
``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards.
``You don't need a special education, special training or a special background to help save the earth.''
The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the world's richest untapped uranium bodies.
The government-approved mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu National Park.
Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing following a protest against the mine.
Later, Katona urged a United Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the land for centuries.
Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging companies.
``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few private companies,'' Nguiffo said.
Some 20 million to 30 million people live in or near the central African rain forest, which is second in size only to the Amazon forest in South America.
