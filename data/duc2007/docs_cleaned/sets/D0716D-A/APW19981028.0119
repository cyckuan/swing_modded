Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday.
The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in the region of the mine had not been properly assessed.
In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, the council said it was particularly concerned about the Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from the mine entrance.
``Malakunanja 2 is acknowledged as currently offering the oldest dated evidence of human occupation in Australia, dating some 50,000-60,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating of buried sands,'' the submission said.
The council was ``not convinced that the archaeological evidence of Malakunanja 2 will retain its integrity given the pressures of the proposed mine.''
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. has begun construction of the Jabiluka mine, which lies on a lease within the boundaries of Kakadu but technically not part of the park.
Environmental groups and local Aborigines oppose the mine.
``It is not certain what impacts noise, vibration, dust and changes to the water table might have on the natural processes of deterioration (of the site) and whether any acceleration of deterioration will occur,'' the council said.
It called on the delegation to declare Kakadu a world heritage area that is ``in danger'' unless Jabiluka is stopped.
The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th ``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural values.
The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
