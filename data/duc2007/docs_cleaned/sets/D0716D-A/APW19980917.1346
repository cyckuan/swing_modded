An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years.
Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine, which it says will inject 6.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion) into the Australian economy, will have any adverse impact on Kakadu.
Senior Police Sgt.
Alan Thomson of the nearby Jabiru police said the protesters locked on to the car will be removed by police.
Thomson said the car looked like a lizard ``with the help of a lot of imagination.''
Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that the Labor Party would stop Jabiluka being built if it won government at the Oct. 3 national election.
