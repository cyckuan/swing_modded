The Greens accused the Howard government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area.
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
"The Howard Government has now in the space of 12 months become the leading agent in undermining world agreements and environmental conventions," Brown was quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying.
"It has become the ace environmental pirate on the planet and Australia's international reputation is being very grievously damaged."
At its meeting in Kyoto, the heritage bureau expressed "grave concerns" about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural values.
But after intensive lobbying from the government the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed report saying what had been done to "prevent further damage and to mitigate all the threats" to the park posed by Jabiluka.
If that report was not satisfactory, the bureau said Kakadu should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining the likes of the war torn old city of Jerusalem.
Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right around the globe".
The bureau's recommendation would be put to the World Heritage Committee this week for a final decision.
It was unlikely the committee would disagree with the bureau.
"This has come out of an intense political lobby devoid of any environmental or cultural rhyme or reason by the Howard Government."
Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people did not agree with its decision.
"You cannot proceed with building a mine without damaging the cultural and environmental values of the Jabiluka valley and therefore the world heritage area," he said.
