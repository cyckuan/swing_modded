The Australian government today gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today defended the government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on development and environmental grounds.
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
"There is no reason, therefore, why it should not go ahead," Howard was quoted today by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation evening TV news program as saying.
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated the Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
In a move apparently to lobby domestic support for the decision, the minister made it clear that the government is looking to Jabiluka's export potential rather than uranium for domestic use.
"Jabiluka means Australia could become the leading world uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.
He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product over 28 years.
The government's decision however has been condemned by environmentalists and opposition parties.
"It is a dark day for Australia when our most precious World Heritage area is consigned as a 60 million ton radioactive waste dump," Wilderness Society national spokesperson Virginia Young said.
Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said the government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area and environmental concerns.
