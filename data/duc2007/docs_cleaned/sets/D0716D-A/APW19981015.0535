rowdy group of protesters was ejected from uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s annual general meeting Thursday after interrupting chairman Campbell Anderson's address.
Those ejected, members of an environmental group called the Wilderness Society, had been protesting against the company's Jabiluka mine development in the Northern Territory.
The demonstrators had bought shares in ERA, a subsidiary of North Ltd., to gain entry to the meeting.
Most of those ejected by security guards were young women who were carried out of the meeting still screaming.
During the melee, one protester cried out: ``Don't you care about our children?''
``Hopefully you won't have any,'' Anderson replied.
Protesters also repeatedly asked the board questions about environmental risks of the proposed mine.
Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
