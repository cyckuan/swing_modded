Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn, according to a statement issued by the protesters.
Of these 130, 20 ``locked on'' to machinery in the compound.
The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action began to about 350.
The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment from uranium mining at Ranger.
