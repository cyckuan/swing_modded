Australia faces international embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau of the U.N. World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites to be placed on its endangered list.
"The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger," the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed."
The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week.
He said he was astonished the report could call for the scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu, but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been operating for 18 years.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone also accused the report's authors of predetermining their findings.
