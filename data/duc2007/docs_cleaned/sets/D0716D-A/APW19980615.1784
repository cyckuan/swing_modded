Construction of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
Chief executive Phillip Shirvington said construction of the mine will take up to 18 months.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable uranium reserves, but only about 14 percent of the world market because of a previous government's restriction on the number of uranium mines.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
Work began on site despite the company not having final approval for its preferred plan for the project.
The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away, for processing.
The plan has been approved by government but is opposed by key Aboriginal landowners, who don't want Jabiluka to proceed.
Landowners have disputed the 1983 agreement and their attempts to have the mining lease declared invalid have failed in the courts.
Shirvington said Tuesday the contractor currently working on the site agreed to work for ERA after protesters blockading the site chained themselves to his truck as he was trying to reach a different job.
``He was pretty angry, we saw the opportunity and negotiated with him to start working for us; he agreed and started straight away,'' Shirvington said.
``The protesters delivered him right into our hands.''
Kate Lecchi, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said they didn't believe the contractor was not going to work on the Jabiluka site, and that demonstrators will continue to try to stop construction.
``We believe that because of our actions ERA is a year behind schedule on this mine and we hope to delay them even more,'' she said from the protest site, about 220 miles (350 kms) from Darwin.
