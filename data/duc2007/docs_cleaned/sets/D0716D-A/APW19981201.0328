Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
The U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization did accept a plea from the Australian government that it be given six months to respond to the panel's ruling.
But the panel recommended that all mining activities should cease in the meantime.
It said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment.
The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as an enclave within it.
Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report, which he has described as superficial and unbalanced.
But he would not tell uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia, which is still 18 months away from mining the first uranium and is still doing preparatory work, to comply with the UNESCO call.
``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for approval of the mine,'' Hill said.
``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage,'' Hill said.
Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over 18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka.
Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's reputation.
``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage Convention no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added.
Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu.
They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people and the rest of the world.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
