high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd..
The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq.
It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
Thousands of tourists visit the park every year.
The company says its good environmental record at the existing Ranger mine shows the Jabiluka project poses no threat.
Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region claim it will cause environmental damage.
However, he said governments can be embarrassed into protecting sites listed by the bureau as endangered.
``The continuing value of Kakadu National Park is something that concerns the whole world, the whole of humanity and therefore justifies such interest,'' Francioni said.
Two parks are currently on the endangered list Yellowstone in the United States and the Galapagos Islands.
