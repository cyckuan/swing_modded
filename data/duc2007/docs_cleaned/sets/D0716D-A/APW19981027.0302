The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
The 27-member Aboriginal Mirrar clan strongly opposed the building of the Jabiluka uranium mine on its traditional land, in an area surrounded by Kakadu.
``The Australian government has mounted a systematic and sustained attack on the living tradition of the Mirrar and Aboriginal people of Kakadu,'' Mirrar spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told the U.N. delegation.
``This attack on the political and social structures of Aboriginal people has manifested itself in the form of massive industrial development associated with uranium mining,'' Katona said.
``The Mirrar believe that the Australian government supports mining at the expense of their very existence.''
She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
The team from the U.N. World Heritage Bureau is visiting the park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine.
It will meet with mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. and government representatives later this week.
The team will report in December to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites.
If Kakadu is put on the ``in danger'' list joining the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali the value of the park as a tourist attraction would be reduced, Katona said.
Such a decision would prove a major international embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister John Howard, which has maintained that the removal of 20 million metric tons of radioactive uranium ore over 28 years will not harm Kakadu.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
