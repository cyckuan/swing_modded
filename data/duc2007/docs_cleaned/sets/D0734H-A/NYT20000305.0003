Frank Ruiz, on parole for possession of heroin, cocaine and guns, was shocked when his parole officer told him he could stay sober with needles.
But three times a week the 39-year-old Panorama City man is jabbed with five acupuncture needles in each ear, and he said it has kept him away from drugs.
``If it wasn't for that program, I'd be back in prison,'' said Ruiz, who has been on parole and sober for four months.
``It is really different but it works out pretty good.''
Of 98 volunteers who have participated in the pilot program since May, four have been re-arrested including one on suspicion of drug sales, said Roy Chaney, the unit supervisor.
``Usually, we have to chase people down.
But these guys will come rain, sleet or snow and they like coming in,'' Chaney said.
``And they're losing their craving for alcohol and drugs.''
Jails and clinics throughout the nation have used the ancient Chinese practice to successfully treat substance abusers.
But the Van Nuys program is the only one of its kind within the parole division of the Department of Corrections in California, officials said.
If the treatment keeps parolees out of jail, it could be expanded throughout Los Angeles County, officials said.
We're helping to keep them out,'' said Joseph Acquah, the acupuncturist and Oriental medical doctor who treats parolees throughout the San Fernando Valley.
It works like this: half-inch needles are inserted in the parolee's ears at points that correspond to the lungs, liver, kidneys and nervous system.
Advocates say the treatment triggers the release of chemicals including endorphins, which helps curb drug cravings, withdrawals and promotes relaxation.
``If it works, and they believe it works, then let them use it,'' said Mike d'Agostine, supervisor of criminal justice services at the Tarzana Treatment Center.
Some of the clients at the Tarzana center have also been treated with acupuncture for substance abuse, he said.
It allows some people to relax more and decrease their anxiety,'' d'Agostine said.
But other forms of treatment are also needed in conjunction with the acupuncture, he said.
The Van Nuys program lasts for at least 12 weeks and requires parolees to attend a drug counseling program in conjunction with the acupuncture.
For Ruiz, acupuncture has meant he can hold down a job, sleep through the night without drugs and improve his relationship with his family.
His wife, Dolores, can vouch for that.
``He's not down.
He's alert and his eating is great,'' his wife of 19 years said.
``The acupuncture really helped him out a lot.
Before, he was always sick if he didn't have what he needed.
Everything's getting back to normal.''
Free of charge to parolees, the acupuncture treatment is a pilot program at the Department of Corrections' Van Nuys office that Chaney started in May.
There is no set time limit for the pilot program and the parolees come of their own will after being informed about it through their parole agents.
``We've found that people have no more cravings for the drugs,'' Chaney said.
Modeled after an acupuncture treatment program at Lincoln Hospital, a New York City-owned facility in the impoverished South Bronx, the Van Nuys program treats about 15 drug-plagued parolees at a time about three times a week.
Often the parolees were convicted of other crimes, including assaults, domestic violence and petty thefts, Chaney said.
Wayne Haradin, 37, of Tujunga said acupuncture has pierced his addiction to pain pills and stimulants.
``You have no cravings.
Your thinking's clear.
You're more aware.
Your sense of smell and touch is more clear.
Before, when I would drive down the road, I was only focused on where I was going and now I see everything that's around me,'' Haradin said, with five needles sprouting from each of his ears.
And he has doubled his productivity at work from three days to six to seven days of work per week as a tub and spa installer.
``After the third session, I was hooked,'' he said.
Another parolee, who declined to give his name for fear of hurting the night clubs he has owned for 28 years throughout the Valley, said he too was hooked on the program after his first few sessions.
``This is a miracle,'' the man said while being treated last week.
Now, I don't touch it,'' he said.
The self-described alcoholic said he tried drinking scotch once his drink of choice after an acupuncture session.
``It didn't taste the same.
It was bitter, spicier.
It didn't come in right,'' he said.
The man has a wine cellar at home that he now does not want to touch, he said.
``In my house, I have every type of cognac and liquor you could dream about,'' he said.
This is a miracle.''
Since the program began, state corrections officials have seen dramatic results: Parolees are getting jobs, maintaining healthy relationships and showing up free of drugs after weekly tests.
``We've got a dedicated group of parolees.
They've been testing free and clear of drugs and alcohol.
It's proving to be a viable treatment,'' said Ivory Roberts, the district parole administrator for the Valley.
