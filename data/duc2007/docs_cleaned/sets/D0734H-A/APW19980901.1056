Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey found.
With millions of Americans visiting alternative practitioners yearly, educators whose job is to prepare doctors of the future have no choice but to ``respond to this relentless challenge to evolve,'' researchers said.
The survey of the nation's 125 medical schools was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The survey, conducted last fall, found that 75 of the 117 responding schools offered elective courses in alternative medicine or included those topics in required courses.
Less than two years before, an AMA poll of the same schools found that only 46 were teaching such topics.
``That's an extraordinary rise for a very traditional and conservative area,'' said lead author Miriam S. Wetzel, a curriculum coordinator at Harvard Medical School.
``Now, these things are being taught in Western medical schools, not necessarily the techniques of how to do them, but certainly about them.''
Dr. David Spiegel, medical director of the Complementary Medicine Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center, said he was not surprised by the survey's findings.
``There has been sort of a sea change,'' he said.
``Traditional doctors are seeing that people are voting with their feet and with their pocketbooks.''
Health insurers in the past have refused to pay for alternative therapies, but that also is changing as insurers realize they can save money.
For example, unconventional treatment might call for exercise or chiropractic or acupuncture for back pain, while the traditional approach might be surgery.
