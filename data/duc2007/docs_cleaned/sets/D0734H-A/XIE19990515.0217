Chinese medical workers have created and are ready to popularize an acupuncture therapy for apoplexy, for which a cure is still lacking in Western medicine.
"Clinical application of the point prescriptions of 'Xingnao Kaiqiao' have yielded positive results in curing apoplexy and its syndromes, and other diseases such as coronary heart disease, cholelithiasis, asthma, and sterility," officials with the State Administration of Chinese Traditional Medicine said.
"The method is effective with 98.56 percent of the cases treated, and the cure rate reaches 59.27 percent."
Invented by professor Shi Xueming, vice president of the Chinese Acupuncture Society, the therapy has already been listed as one of the top-ten traditional medical achievements this year.
So far, the hospital working with Shi has set up some ten centers across China to train medical workers in the practice of this therapy.
The treatment has also been adopted in more than 80 countries to treat apoplexy, and Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea, among others, have also established special organizations to explore and popularize this method.
