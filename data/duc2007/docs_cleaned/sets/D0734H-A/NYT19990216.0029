Thirty years ago, while in her early 20s, Levow nearly died when a doctor gave her painkillers during an operation.
Since then, she's been terrified to take any pain relievers during medical procedures.
``It's a little scary to have that happen...
So Levow resorted to an unusual counterpunch recently when told she needed dental surgery: acupuncture.
And she isn't alone.
With an increasing number of patients reporting pain, fear and experiences like hers, local doctors have become more open-minded about the blending of conventional and alternative therapies.
``After (the acupuncturist) put the needles in, she stuck a needle directly into my gum to see what would happen.
Convinced she could use this alternative in her dentist's chair, Levow got permission from Delray Beach, Fla. dentist Dr. Hyman Friedman to bring the acupuncturist to his office.
Before the scaling, scraping and pulling he was to perform, the acupuncturist Simm Gottesman of Deerfield Beach, Fla. carefully placed needles on the side of Levow's face, her ear, and her hand to ease her pain.
Friedman was fascinated.
``It might not work with every patient, but I was impressed,'' the dentist says.
Some say the movement toward so-called ``alternative'' treatments may be driven by economics.
Dr. David Eisenberg, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, led a survey that found a sharp increase in the use of alternative medicine by Americans from 1990 to 1997.
Whatever doctors' motivation, bastions of conventionality such as The American Medical Association are taking alternatives seriously.
The AMA devoted the entire November issue of its journal to alternative therapies.
Across the road from Jupiter Medical Center, where patients undergo CAT scans and other high-tech medical procedures, the new Mind/Body Institute offers alternative treatments from hydrotherapy to acupuncture to therapeutic touch.
But there's no real competition here between conventional and alternative healing methods: The center is a department of the hospital.
``Over 300 medical institutions are employing mind/body centers in this country,'' says John Fritz, executive director of the new institute.
``We feel we'll be able to show others how to do this.''
Fritz admitted it took some meeting of the minds before the medical center's doctors were comfortable with the institute's offerings.
The institute, which opened in November, was a gift to the hospital from Guy and Jackie Fiske, area residents whose son is a cancer researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.
Patients are either referred by doctors or come in on their own.
And they're not always dealing with intractable pain, which drives many to seek alternative care.
The institute offers programs for weight reduction, smoking cessation, and insomnia, Fritz said.
Because the institute is part of the hospital, Fritz thinks it might make people more comfortable seeking alternative treatments.
And trust is a precious commodity, especially when treating patients with chronic pain.
A-h-h-h-h. Barbara Cottrill lets out an explosive sigh.
She is being treated for her chronic pain by Brett Ferrigan, a licensed acupuncturist who isn't a medical doctor, but is certified in Florida to perform the age-old treatment.
He works at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach.
It's on the campus of St. Mary's Hospital but is a separate corporation and operates independently.
The center has offered alternative treatments for more than a year.
Cottrill has acute pain from an operation 10 years ago that was followed by a fall.
``Pain changes you,'' she says, as Ferrigan strategically places acupuncture needles in her feet and hands to relieve her suffering.
The Palm Beach Gardens resident has been through many medical procedures for pain, she said, even nerve blocks.
But results varied.
She tried acupuncture when her doctor suggested it.
Ferrigan sticks a needle in the big toe of her right foot.
When the ``blocked energy'' that Ferrigan blames for the pain is released, Cottrill flinches again, as if someone has clamped a cardiac paddle on her chest and yelled, ``clear.''
She says the acupuncture brings relief where conventional painkillers haven't.
``People come primarily for pain,'' says Ferrigan, who has started getting referrals from St. Mary's doctors.
It's very gratifying for me.''
That type of partnership is growing.
At the same time, The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, a 12-year-old society of medical doctors trained in acupuncture, has seen its membership grow from 200 in 1991 to 1,550 today.
Dr. Joan Barice, an Ivy League-trained doctor, practices her skills on military veterans.
Barice works part-time at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in West Palm Beach.
She's a longtime supporter of alternative care.
``I've been treating VA patients more than a year with acupuncture.
I've heard nothing but good things from patients,'' she said.
And they also recognize that when you're working with chronic pain patients, and nothing has really relieved that suffering, it's a useful adjunctive tool.
``Until not that long ago, doctors mistrusted chiropractors and were resisting things they didn't know,'' Barice said.
``Right now, people are jumping on the bandwagon for a number of reasons.
Profit motivation, or patients want it.
It's almost a shotgun marriage in a lot of places between alternative and traditional medicine.''
