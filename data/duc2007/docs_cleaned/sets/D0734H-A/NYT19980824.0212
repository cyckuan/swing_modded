patch on Art Soto's abdomen continuously releases a morphine-like drug into his system to lessen the discomfort from his long battle with AIDS.
But once a week, Soto also avails himself of a much different painkiller: acupuncture.
As the needles are gently inserted and twisted into his legs, Soto says he feels more energized, and the throbbing and numbing begins to subside.
Acupuncture, especially for pain management, is becoming more common.
Health maintenance organizations are starting to pay for the ancient Chinese therapy, and last week the California Legislature sent the governor a bill requiring workers' compensation policies to cover it.
Many already do.
As a result, doctors are seeing more patients whose regimens include treatments such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which Soto also takes.
The issue has become more pressing for mainstream medicine since the National Institutes of Health last year gave acupuncture a qualified endorsement for treating post-operative and dental pain, nausea from chemotherapy, and morning sickness.
Cheryl Sterling, who is Soto's acupuncturist, said the walls between western and alternative medicine are starting to come down.
She now talks with the doctors of some of her patients about their care.
And the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where she is a dean, is in the midst of discussions with the Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization and the University of California at San Francisco about joint efforts that could bring the two approaches closer together, she said.
Hospitals, medical centers and senior centers are also seeking to explore possible relationships.
``The trend is definitely going to this quote integrative care,'' Sterling said.
``It means more patients and more revenue.''
Kaiser spokeswoman Lila Petersen said the HMO does offer acupuncture in its chronic pain management program to patients referred by their primary care physicians.
``More and more, our patients are asking for alternative health care methods, so we are working to provide those services,'' she said.
Still, the treatments are controversial in some quarters, and its underlying mechanisms remain a mystery to western medicine.
Sterling said the therapies work by manipulating the patient's life energy, or ``qi'' (pronounced ``chi'').
In an exam room at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine's Potrero Hill clinic, Sterling begins Soto's treatment by asking about his health during the past week.
He undresses, and Sterling runs her hands down his legs, where Soto has complained of pain.
When he responds to her touch, she calls out ``Liver 8'' or ``Spleen 1'' points on his ``channels'' that are blocked.
She explains that the channels lose their ``moisture'' because of the HIV infection and as a result the energy is obstructed, causing pain.
This time, Sterling and an assistant insert and twirl half a dozen needles into specific locations on Soto's legs and feet.
Sterling says she can feel the needle interact with the qi, ``like a fish on a hook.''
Some of the needles are then attached to a device that sends out an electrical current.
All of this happens while gentle guitar music overlaid on the sounds of the ocean play on a cassette player nearby.
To some, the theory and the practice seem fuzzy, and skeptics chalk up the many patient testimonials to the placebo effect.
The National Council Against Health Fraud's position paper on acupuncture says it remains unproven and its ``theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge.''
Still, some studies have shown that there are physiological changes including the release of the body's own natural painkillers, endorphins during treatment, suggesting there may be something more at work.
``More and more insurance companies are saying, `Gee, there might be some literature to support this, so let's have it as a covered benefit,''' said Ellen Hughes, interim director of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.
The university has begun a research study with breast cancer patients to look at the benefits of acupuncture in treating the side effects of chemotherapy.
``Careful scientific minds are looking at the data, and there's more of it,'' Hughes said.
``It's going to be more mainstream.''
