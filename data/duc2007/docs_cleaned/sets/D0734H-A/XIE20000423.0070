The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine is now being acknowledged by more and more people around the world, said an official of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine here Saturday.
Shen Zhixiang, an official with the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, noted that traditional Chinese medicine has been exported to over 130 countries and regions, with annual foreign exchange earning of 600 million US dollars, a figure expected to grow each year.
China has sent several hundred medical teams and over 10,000 doctors to foreign countries, especially developing countries, to provide services to the local people.
Shen pointed out that by 1998, China had conducted governmental level exchanges and cooperation on traditional Chinese medicine with over 40 countries and regions including the United States, Japan, and France.
China and the World Health Organization (WHO) have made achievements in cooperation in traditional Chinese medicine, and the WHO now has seven traditional medicine cooperation centers and three acupuncture training centers in China, in a bid to introduce and promote traditional Chinese medicine to the world.
China has trained nearly 15,000 foreigners from over 130 countries and regions in traditional Chinese medicine in the past decade, extending the influence of this method of treatment worldwide.
Now, most countries and regions worldwide have various kinds of clinics and research centers devoted to traditional Chinese medicine.
China will continue exchanges with foreign countries in traditional medicine education and technology research, and also will consider establishing hospitals in foreign countries, said Shen.
