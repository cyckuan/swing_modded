medical expert committee today endorsed Chinese traditional needle therapy acupuncture as part of the mainstream American medicine.
The 12-member committee selected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that "clear evidence" has been found that acupuncture effectively treats pain after surgery or dental procedures and controls nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy or pregnancy.
The committee also said in a report that acupuncture also is effective in some patients for tennis elbow, muscle pain and menstrual cramps.
"For the first time there is a public statement from the Health and Human Services that acupuncture might have a role in treating certain health problems," said Dr. Helga Well-Apelt, a medical doctor who uses Chinese medicine in her practice.
"It can now be called real medicine," said Dr. Bradley J. Williams, president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, an organization of about 3,000 doctors certified to perform acupuncture.
With a history of more than 2,000 years, acupuncture is a major part of an Asian tradition of medicine.
The practice of the therapy involves sticking thin, sharpened needles into specific nerve junction points on the body.
The needles often are rotated or electrically stimulated.
Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation only after late U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
