World rights (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) When Sharon Gretz Lasky found out she had melanoma last August, she wasn't ready to surrender to cancer.
Therefore, her treatment consisted not only of surgery to remove a block of tissue from her thigh and lymph nodes, but also of acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.
Best of all, Lasky was able to get top-notch conventional and alternative care under one roof.
After her cancer was diagnosed, she began treatment at the three-year-old Center for Complementary Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside Hospital.
The same health-care network that featured her oncologist and plastic surgeon for tissue reconstruction also included an acupuncturist, a massage therapist and other alternative practitioners.
``Everyone who worked with me the surgeons, the acupuncturist, the nutritionist and the rest were part of my health-care team,'' she said.
``They treated my cancer, but they also helped me through my fears, so I went into surgery incredibly calm and confident.''
In addition, Lasky got help in dealing with pain and recuperation and the news that she'd need a second operation to remove a spot from her lung.
Thankfully, the tissue in her lung proved noncancerous, and she left the hospital in half the expected time and with much less pain medication.
This integrative approach to treating an illness certainly isn't new.
But the fact that Lasky was able to get multifaceted treatment at a single facility is indicative of a growing trend in health care: the integrative medicine facility.
Across the country, an ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care organizations are setting up complementary-care centers.
As yet, no one is tracking these centers as a group, but last year, the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9 percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services; some estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in the near future.
Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each patient's course of treatment.
Others offer individual therapies such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for it.
``If you look at what was happening even a few years ago, the extent to which complementary services have become part of the health-care system is astonishing,'' said John Weeks, editor and publisher of The Integrator, a newsletter covering the business of alternative medicine.
``We're really in the first phase of a process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years.''
``As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions for themselves, this trend is really going to take off,'' said Dr. Samuel Benjamin, director of the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
``There will be only one medicine in the future, and it will include all of the things that we once thought of as either alternative or conventional.''
What's more, demographics support the notion that these centers are here to stay.
``Baby boomers are hearing that they could live to 80 or 90 or 100, and they want to be healthy doing it,'' Weeks said.
An expected squeeze in the labor market in the next several years should prompt companies to seek more and better services with which to attract and retain employees.
At the top of any worker's list: better health care.
``Patients are going to demand more complementary medicine, and they're going to demand it right in the hospital they're using,'' said Dr. James N. Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New York City.
Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative medicine: the information shortfall.
Patients often use alternative therapies in a smorgasbord-like way, without a complete understanding of the advantages or risks involved.
``Part of what got me into the development of our center is that I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies,'' said Dr. Mimi Guarneri, an interventional cardiologist and the medical director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, Calif. ``They were out there buying every vitamin and herb they could find, and I was concerned that they might not know enough about what they were taking.''
With this in mind, hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to inform patients about various alternative therapies.
Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly skeptical about complementary approaches, many clinics have also made research and analysis part of their standard operations.
``If we don't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye, there's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense,'' said Guarneri.
``As a physician, you can't stand up and present anecdotes without being thrown out of the room.''
Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share that information with other hospitals nationwide.
Many centers are conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual therapies the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one, is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.
Of course, what matters to patients isn't hard-core data but real-life outcomes.
And in that respect, the news is positive.
``Many complementary therapies can help people face an illness more calmly, use less pain medication and recover more quickly,'' said Dr. Lewis Mehl-Medrona, program director for the Pittsburgh medical center and the author of ``Coyote Medicine.''
Tracy Cunning definitely agreed.
The 35-year-old research assistant received therapeutic touch and massage at the Center for Health Well-Being at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, while undergoing knee surgery at the hospital.
(She also had acupuncture treatments at an unaffiliated center nearby, with her doctor's blessing.)
Just one day after her surgery, she put away the crutches she'd been given; by the third day, she'd tossed her pain pills, having taken only six of the 30 that had been prescribed.
``Everyone was very supportive,'' she recalled.
Will the fact that so many hospitals are bringing complementary therapies under one roof mean less out-of-pocket costs for consumers?
Probably not at least, not right away, said Dr. James N. Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New York City.
``The fact that these centers are opening will put pressure on insurers to pay for more things,'' he said.
``But that will take time.
Right now, we're seeing very few insurers paying for any alternative medical treatment beyond chiropractic, which is licensed in all 50 states.''
But chiropractic is the one treatment that most of these centers have the hardest time offering, he said.
``Most academic medical centers freak out at the mere mention of the word.''
So where does that leave consumers?
``You'll see massage offered at most of the centers, but most insurers won't pay for it,'' Dillard said.
At best, you'll get a discounted rate.
How about acupuncture, therapeutic touch or nutritional counseling?
``Maybe,'' he said.
``But it's still not too common, no matter where it's provided.''
Insurance companies are motivated by numbers, he explained, meaning they will pay for treatments that are cost-effective.
So the pressure is on the complementary-care centers to track patient outcomes and prove to insurers that alternative treatments work as well as or better than conventional treatments in managing disease and keeping costs down.
