Chinese herbal medicines are now selling 10 to 15 billion U.S. dollars worth, two to three times the 1990 figure.
This trade amounts to 10 to 15 percent of the world's total, according to Prof. Zhang Boli, director of a traditional medicine institute in Tianjin.
Prof. Zhang told a national medical symposium today that one of the reasons for the increasing popularity is that people are becoming more concerned about the side-effects of other medicines and are looking for alternatives.
Another reason is that new medicines need a lot of time and money to develop.
There are at least 170 companies and many research institutes developing herbal medicines world-wide.
Zhang said that some European and North American countries now account for about a quarter of the natural medicine use, and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe account for 32 percent, while China consumes nearly half.
The WHO has also put traditional medicine development on its agenda and has built 26 traditional medicine centers.
In 1980, it announced 43 diseases that it considered suitable for treatment by acupuncture and moxibustion, and one branch has published a guidebook on herbal medicines.
