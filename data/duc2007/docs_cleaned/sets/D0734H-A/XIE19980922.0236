Almost 70 percent of Americans now turn to alternative forms of medicine to cure their illness when regular medicine has failed, according to a recent nationwide survey.
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted by the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, found that 56 percent of those surveyed believe their health plans should cover alternative care.
They are also willing to pay for it in their medical insurance premiums.
The label "alternative medicine" covers a range of products and treatment, some derived from centuries-old spiritual and healing traditions of non-Western societies, others as new and high-tech as pressurized oxygen chambers.
In common is that they all fall outside the list of "standard" therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical authorities.
While the Stanford survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.
On average, participants in the study made four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
On average, the survey respondents said they would be willing to spend an additional 15 U.S. dollars a month in health insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or acupuncture.
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School revealed that one in three Americans used non-traditional or non-Western medicine, spending 14 billion dollars a year in treatment.
Earlier this year, a Los Angeles Times report said that alternative medicine is now an 18-billion-dollar industry edging into the U.S. mainstream.
Americans will spend 3.65 billion dollars on herbal remedies this year, a 100 percent increase since 1994.
California takes the lead in this trend.
Six major health insurance firms in California alone decided this year to cover acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.
And the Stanford University Medical Center opened a similar patient-care program in April.
What attracts consumers, medical centers and insurance companies is the hope that alternative medical practices may provide health plans with a relatively low-cost feature.
Moreover, doctors say, there is a negative feeling toward Western medicine's ability to deal with certain health problems, particularly chronic diseases.
Western medicine has made considerably less progress against lingering health problems such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and chronic pain.
