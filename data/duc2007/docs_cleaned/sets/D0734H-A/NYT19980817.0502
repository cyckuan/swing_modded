The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said it all.
Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected to, and then he had taken even more.
Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet.
Then came abandonment on the beaches of Brooklyn.
Mercy arrived in the form of a new owner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but when he was 8, Al's back gave out.
Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he still wasn't the dog he used to be.
His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a pilgrimage of stubborn hope.
There, in a back yard in Murray Hill, Al dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water that might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower essences had not: heal him.
With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding tight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his gimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise they sorely needed.
His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he left the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn chair.
That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has ushered in a whole new era in animal care.
Ms. Richard's business, Bonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is but one example.
Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking dogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with homeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets beneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with lavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.
All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture blissed out on St. John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil.
It is also the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many Americans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances, from summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of their families.
Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of cross-species psychological transference.
``We project our character flaws on our pets,'' he said.
``We project our behavior on them.
I've even had clients project their religion on them.
This is very much in the same fashion.''
Could your cat benefit from an adjustment?
There are a growing number of veterinary chiropractors on hand.
Is there knotting in your dog's muscles?
You can take him to a canine massage therapist.
If it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not just on the most common species.
Dr. Gerald Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has performed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones.
Dr. Marcie Fallek, who has offices in New York and Fairfield, Conn., has administered homeopathic treatments solutions with minuscule traces of special plant or mineral ingredients to a pet raccoon that was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and had stopped using its litter box.
The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities would learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be interviewed for this article, even anonymously, Fallek said.
``Her psychic told her there might be trouble,'' Fallek explained.
``Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know.''
Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure quackery?
As it turns out, less than one might think.
Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at least on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was beyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably effective.
But Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower essences and the like.
``That's really getting on the fringe,'' he said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians and their clients.
``The world is made up of a lot of very vulnerable and gullible people,'' he cautioned.
It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes to the vim and vigor of their hirsute or, for that matter, feathered loved ones.
According to the association, expenditures by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied, from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for inflation).
During that period, the pet population grew only modestly.
The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not cheap.
In New York City where, granted, prices for most things tend to be highest half an hour of acupuncture generally costs $50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing waters costs $75.
Because treatments are usually repeated over the course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high hundreds.
Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than just random experimentation more than two decades ago.
Racehorses were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes surrounding the health of these animals were highest.
But in the last five years, the field has really taken off, drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.
The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians.
The International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974, reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is still a small fraction of all veterinarians.
Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats, dogs and parrots.
There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product catalogs, many with their own Internet sites.
CAN END HERE.
Although pets being given alternative treatments are often following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the other way.
It was a busy, busy day.
While Lola, who was bouncing back from a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.
But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a particularly intimate, thorough petting.
``Feel for the bony landmarks,'' Ms. Cooper instructed O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in Chinatown.
``Push away from the spine.''
Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with kidney problems.
For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn; then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin cushion.
Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.
Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about 35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for running.
Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu recovering from surgery for a ruptured disc.
The operation had left Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully regain.
This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked as far as these things can be determined appalled and terrified about taking the plunge.
``He's a good boy,'' Lauran Walk, his owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the surface.
``He's a good, good boy.''
Ms.
Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village, said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.
But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.
``He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a chance,'' Ms.
Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a shivering knot of fur with limited mobility.
