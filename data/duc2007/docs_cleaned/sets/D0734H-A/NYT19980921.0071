Nearly 70 percent of Americans now turn to alternative forms of medicine from acupuncture to tai chi and guided imagery to cure their ills when regular medicine has failed, according to a nationwide survey released at Stanford University.
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people also showed that 56 percent of those interviewed believe their health plans should cover alternative care.
They are also willing to pay for it in their medical insurance premiums.
``What we see from this survey and many other indicators is that people generally want to take control of their own health, using those services they find most effective,'' said William Haskell, a Stanford professor of medicine.
``This places responsibility on both traditional care providers and health educators to ensure that responsible information and advice are available to patients,'' he added.
While the survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, it said roughly half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.
On average, participants in the study made four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
Significantly, those surveyed said that their decision whether to consult a conventional physician or a practitioner of alternative medicine, was guided principally by the practitioner's ``technical skills at diagnosis and treatment.''
The findings were released at a conference on alternative and complementary medicine held last week at Stanford Medical Center and attended by more than 500 physicians and other health care professionals from across the nation.
The survey was conducted by the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
Haskell is the principal investigator for Stanford in a major federally funded study of the effectiveness of complementary and/or alternative medicine.
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School revealed that 1 in 3 Americans used nontraditional medicine, spending $14 billion a year in treatments.
The Stanford findings did not include patient expenditures for alternative medicine.
But, on average, survey respondents said they would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 a month in health insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or acupuncture.
While many physicians are still skeptical of alternative medicine, a growing number of patient care organizations offer complementary services in clinics alongside traditional medicine or reimburse patients for alternative treatments.
Public interest in alternative medicine presents some challenges and obligations for traditional physicians, said Wes Alles of the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
``Whether we are talking about vitamins, yoga, acupuncture, massage or a variety of other practices, physicians should be candid with their patients about which techniques they feel are most appropriate for each patient,'' he said.
