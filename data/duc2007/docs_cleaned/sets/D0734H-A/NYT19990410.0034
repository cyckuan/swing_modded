Acupuncture, therapeutic massage, herbal therapies and yoga: Have these alternative therapies earned their place in mainstream American medicine?
Dr. Andrew Weil, arguing for their acceptance, and Dr. Arnold Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate Friday night at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
Weil, who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative medicine, sparred on most points with Relman, editor and chief emeritus at the New England School of Medicine, who is squarely from the mainstream medical community.
The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote in the ``New'' ``Republic,'' in which he referred to Weil's methods as preposterous.
At the debate, he said Weil's therapies are ``based on wildly implausible theories.''
The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring alternative medicine.
With 42 percent of the public now using some sort of alternative medical therapies, Weil and others have been pushing the nation's medical schools to start requiring more medical students to learn more about such things as acupuncture, herbal therapies and hundreds of other therapies.
Relman was appalled by that idea that medical students should be taught alternative therapies.
Teaching medical students how to do alternative therapies would overthrow what medical schools teach, Relman said.
``You believe first,'' he said to Weil.
``Then you try it.
Maybe it will work.
We tell medical students to look for the data.
To look for objective evidence is how you train doctors to be trustworthy or reliable.
``Why should we bring it into the medical mainstream when evidence is scant?
It is based on unproven therapies, contrary to all that 20th-century medicine .
``We're in a time of breakthroughs and this won't help us make those advances.''
But Weil disagreed, saying that powerful social and economic forces moving now are going to make alternative medicine even more widely used and it would be better to have doctors trained than to just let it happen haphazardly.
Otherwise, he said, we may have HMOs deciding what type of massage therapy is good.
More corporations are also interested in health plans that include alternative therapies but don't know how to sort out what works and what is cost-effective, Weil said.
This is the future not only because patients want it, but practitioners do, too, he added.
``Medical students want to know why they aren't learning about herbal therapies,'' Weil said.
Relman replied that the reason more doctors and medical students are interested in it is that medical care is being delivered like a business.
They are unhappy spending less time with patients and may be looking for a different livelihood themselves.
It was the first of what may be many discussions in the future that could affect every person's health, and the two participants hope to take the debate to other college campuses.
In response to Relman's comment that sorting out what to teach from all the various alternative therapies would be impossible, Weil said he found his answer on a button that someone sent him: ``Those who say it can't be done should get of the way of people doing it.''
Both spoke strongly Friday on their positions, said Dr. Chris Shearer, residency director at Phoenix Baptist Hospital and president of the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.
``One winner in this debate that there needs to be more research about alternative therapies,'' he said.
And there is, although many say not enough considering the huge growing interest in alternative medicines.
The National Institutes of Health is spending $40 million to $50 million on research on alternative therapies this year.
``Dr. Relman's responses were defined by traditional medicine,'' said Carol Feingold, faculty member of the UA College of Nursing.
``But I think people want more than that, they don't just want treatment of disease.
They want health care, but they want the whole picture.''
Richard L. Bourke, chairman of National Integrative Medicine, a health care business in the Valley, said, ``Patients today are looking to physicians for answers and aren't getting them.
Doctors don't have the training or the time.''
There are a lot of different terms used when people describe alternative therapies.
Studies have shown that most of those using alternative medicine are women, and about 86 percent have at least some college, said Rena Gordon, a medical geographer affiliated with both the University of Arizona and Arizona State University.
They are middle-age and socially established.
Many of them live in the West.
They use alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional medicine, she said.
Only 4 percent use alternative medicine exclusively but disclosure is low.
No one knows how many people go to alternative healers because they don't talk about it, especially with their family physician.
Because Weil's clinic at UA is a teaching clinic, it is unable to accommodate large numbers of patients.
There is a waiting list of several hundred and at least several months to be seen.
The clinic is set up as a self-pay program because most HMOs don't reimburse.
Nevertheless, individuals interested in a place on the waiting list may call 1-(520)-694-6555.
