Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport Beach, Calif. ``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety of conditions this way.''
Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West keep expanding.
Inserting needles into pressure points throughout the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents a whole new concept in cosmetics.
``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles underneath the skin,'' says Woo.
``Stimulating energy centers restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body.''
``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach, California.
I'm most pleased about that.''
Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture treatments.
But inviting as the treatment seems, not many acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain, adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility.
``It opens the channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's cells.
The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate wrinkles.''
Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease their anxiety.
They don't hurt.''
Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed atmosphere.
The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from patient to patient.
Some require as few as nine, and others need 16 or so placed strategically around their face.
``The needles bring more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo, ``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells.
The needles activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more elasticity.''
After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape to put pressure on the muscles.
Anesthesia cream is applied to the sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort.
Then he inserts the needles at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top of the head.
This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in place for about a half hour.
Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate circulation to the face.
``It's the same pressure point used to stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes.
Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin.
Ten treatments usually do the job.
Then, maintenance visits once or twice a month renew the benefits.
Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment.
Woo explains that restoring the essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and increases a sense of well being.
This shows in the face.
``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says.
``That is then followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease.''
Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to achieving beauty than a surgical facelift.
The focus on the whole person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that.
But if I can put it off, that's a good idea, I think.
Acupuncture seems like a better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to keep up.
And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
Since the field still remains relatively new to the public, issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need further clarification.
The majority of states offer licensure or registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the same credentialing exam.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes.
This ensures good manufacturing practices and high standards of sterility.
The FDA recommends that the needles be used only once.
The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia.
The consensus panel concluded that further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be helpful.
Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all encompassing way for some patients.
``It gives me a better feeling just to know I don't have wrinkles.
``I'm a preventive type person, and my appearance and my mood are important to me.
