National Institutes of Health sponsored panel has concluded that acupuncture merits inclusion in the comprehensive treatment for certain common conditions, and called for further research in its application.
The Los Angles-based American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (AAMA) announced this today and said in a press release that it is pleased about the conclusions made by the NIH Consensus Development Conference.
"The NIH-sponsored panel pointed out that when incorporated into a comprehensive medical teatment program, acupuncture may be as effective as many accepted conventional medical therapies," AAMA said.
"The panel particularly cited the low incidence of side effects of acupuncture when compared to many accepted Western medical therapies such as medications and invasive procedures," it added.
"These conclusions support AAMA's mission to offer the highest quality health care to patients by combining the best of both worlds into safe and effective medical care," it said.
Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the American healthcare system.
