The number of Americans who are using alternative treatments such as herbal supplements, massage therapy and megavitamins is increasing dramatically, said the Washington Post Wednesday by quoting studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
"It is the beginning of the beginning of acceptance of some forms of 1998 alternative medicine into mainstream medicine in the United States," said George Lundberg, editor of the JAMA.
An estimated 83 million American adults, more than four out of 10, used some form of alternative medical treatment last year, said a new survey by a Harvard research team.
They said that visits to practitioners of alternative therapies, from herbal medicines to "energy healing," have increased 47 percent since 1990.
In addition to herbal medicine and "energy healing," the alternative therapies included in the survey were relaxation techniques, massage therapy, chiropractic, spiritual healing, megavitamins, self-help, imagery, homeopathy, hypnosis, biofeedback, acupuncture, folk remedies and various diets.
Among the fastest growing therapies were herbal remedies, massage, megavitamins, relaxation techniques and "spiritual healing."
One study found that moxibustion, a traditional Chinese therapy in which a herb, Artemisia vulgaris, was burned next to an acupuncture point on the toe, proved safe and effective for stimulating fetuses in the wombs of pregnant women to turn over from a breech position to a head-first position, which is safer for delivery.
However, some medical experts have expressed concern that herbal products, which do not have to meet any official government purity or manufacturing standards, may carry dangerous impurities.
