Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
His decision will provide the basis for further court hearings and possibly settlement negotiations to determine what remedies to impose on Microsoft.
The company said it would appeal.
At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company.
``While no final decision has been made,'' Klein said, ``the department is committed to finding a remedy that will protect consumers, innovation and competition by putting an end to Microsoft's widespread and persistent abuse of its monopoly power and to rectifying its unlawful attempt to monopolize the Internet browser market.''
At the news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed satisfaction over the ruling.
``We are pleased that the court agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed consumers,'' she said.
``Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law.''
The decision culminated the Clinton administration's most ambitious antitrust effort.
Gore received an icy reception when he visited the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., last November.
Gore did not explicitly embrace the antitrust action, but said then that ``the values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that are sound.''
