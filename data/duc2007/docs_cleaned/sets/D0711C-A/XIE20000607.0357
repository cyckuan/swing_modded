federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that the software giant be split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since ATT agreed to spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said, citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the 1990s that preceded the antitrust case.
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling that, as expected, the company would appeal.
"We have a very strong appeal," Gates said.
Since its 1975 founding, Microsoft has grown to become the world's most valuable software company with annual revenues of over 20 billion U.S. dollars a year.
With 60 foreign offices and its software used around the world, a breakup would eventually affect computer users worldwide.
The U.S. Justice Department and 17 of the states that sued Microsoft proposed the split after Jackson concluded on April 3 that the firm violated U.S. antitrust law.
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
Breakup of the company could also encourage development of alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
Microsoft, which expects to win on appeal, says a breakup would harm consumers by preventing it from developing integrated products.
The company's appeal could bypass the normal appeals court process and go straight to the Supreme Court under a mechanism available in major antitrust cases.
But several legal experts said they believed the high court would decline to receive the case on an expedited basis.
