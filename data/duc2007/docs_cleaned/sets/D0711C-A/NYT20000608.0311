They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want.''
The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.''
Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft.
The company's chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into ``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America.''
Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company, said Charles J. Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Virginia School of Law.
Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style.
``There has been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field.''
``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from those products.''
Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him'' on his factual findings.
If those findings are accepted, Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely sensible'' under legal precedents.
Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.
Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.
Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.
But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal.
It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal.
But even on that subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.
``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.
Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.
They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products.
But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.
Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense.
``Every industry, as it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law applies to it.''
