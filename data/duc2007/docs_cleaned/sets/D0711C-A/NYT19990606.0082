The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business, is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the government.
In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement to drop OS/2 from its machines.
He specifically mentioned the proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's relationship with IBM's P.C.
But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2 from its PC's.
In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in 1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between the two companies.
That effort, he said, included drafting a document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal.''
That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other divisions of IBM.''
Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in court during the cross-examination of Norris.
But Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2.
Yes, we have documents that we believe show that.''
The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according to Baber.
The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 states that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.
Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
He also testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying $9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45 for Windows 95.
Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in software, IBM had shared in the development costs.
Compaq's price for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several dollars lower than IBM's price.
But that, he insisted, was mainly because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which included providing customer support for Windows and writing software to make printers and other hardware work well with Windows.
