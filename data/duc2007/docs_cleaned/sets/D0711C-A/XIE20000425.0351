Antitrust lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department were summoned to the White House Tuesday to brief President Bill Clinton's legal and economic advisers about a range of options for dealing with Microsoft Corp., including splitting up the software giant.
Local press reports said that attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways to break up the company as a method to curb anticompetitive practices.
One reported option would be to split the company into two or three parts, each selling separate products, such as the Windows operating system and Internet content.
Another alternative would be for Microsoft to divest its popular Office software.
The government and the states have the option of filing separate recommendations, but both sides hope to turn in a single proposal.
Each has until Friday to submit proposed remedies to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled on April 3 that Microsoft illegally used its dominance in the operating systems market to hurt competition.
The ruling came after a 78-day trial that began in October 1998.
Microsoft officials have said they will appeal Judge Jackson's ruling and expect to prevail.
They have rejected a breakup, saying that such a remedy reaches far beyond the evidence presented in the trail.
"There is nothing in the trial record or in this case that would justify such an extreme and radical remedy," Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said Monday.
"This would be bad for Microsoft, consumers and the entire industry."
Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the government's proposal, but it may ask for an extension depending on the remedies requested.
If the Justice Department calls for breaking up Microsoft, it would be the agency's first such action since the 1974 antitrust suit against ATT Corp. that led to the breakup of the telephone giant.
Microsoft has already made clear that it will appeal the ruling against it.
The case is considered likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
