The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, Thursday or Friday.
But the Justice Department asked him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on the government's remedy proposal.
Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the proposed decree prior to its entry.''
Lawyers interpreted that to mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the government proposal gutting it, in the view of some government officials.
The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed to break Microsoft into two companies.
One would hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
The proposal would also put in place almost immediately a wide range of remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct while the breakup is being carried out.
Microsoft's comments would delay all of the remedies and heavily modify most of them.
