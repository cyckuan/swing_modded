Microsoft Corp. has agreed to hold back on the shipment of Windows 98 while settlement talks with the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys generals are still under way.
Sources who reached the public Thursday morning said that the parties held the 11th negotiations earlier Thursday concerning a major Sherman Antitrust case that was about to be launched against the software giant.
Microsoft Corp. is making a last minute offer to settle the charges.
However, it is said, that a suit could still be filed unless Microsoft is willing to make "serious concessions" and changes in its business practices.
News reported Wednesday that the Justice Department and at least 19 states plan to file historic antitrust cases Thursday against Microsoft.
If they proceed, the suits could be among the biggest corporate challenges in history, according to analysts.
Microsoft originally planned to ship its new Windows 98 operating system in PC to retailers Friday, and put it on shelves of computer stores on June 25.
Its critics would like to see a court block the planned public release.
To them, the company purposely embedded a Web brower into the new software which they claim is designed to enslave the entire Internet-using public to Microsoft's will.
