The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp., U.S. newspapers reported today.
Justice Department spokesman confirmed Thursday that "we have an ongoing investigation and it's continuing."
Netscape Communication Corp., Microsoft's major rival in the U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software.
It said that Microsoft was unfairly offering computer makers financial "inducements" for giving Microsoft's Internet software an exclusive place on their computers, or for making Netscape's product "far less accessible to users."
But Microsoft dismissed those claims as "wide and untrue."
Microsoft Senior Vice President William H. Neukom said Thursday that "the facts will show that Microsoft is competing vigorously and legally."
Microsoft, based in Redmond of Washington, has been the focus of antitrust investigations in the past years.
Last year, the Justice Department opposed Microsoft's planned 2-billion-dollar purchase of Intuit Inc., maker of Quicken personal finance software, and Microsoft had to pay Intuit 46.2 million dollars for the trouble.
The U.S. government has strengthened its antitrust efforts in recent years as the market competitions are more and more fierce and complicated.
