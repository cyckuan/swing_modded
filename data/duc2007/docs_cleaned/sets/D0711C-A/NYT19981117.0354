The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private law suit in California, will have on the government's case is uncertain.
But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit do include the practices that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market for personal computer software.
If Sun's Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could pose a serious challenge to Microsoft.
And in the California case, Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language, Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S. District Court in San Jose ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement with Sun.
The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult to determine.
``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
``It helps the atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond that what the effect will be.''
The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.
``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs Co. ``Microsoft does not have to pull products out of distribution.''
But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the antitrust case.''
