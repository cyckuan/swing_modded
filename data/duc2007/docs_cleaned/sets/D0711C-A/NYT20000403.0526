Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled Monday.
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the Netscape browser.
Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in November, overwhelmingly supported that view.
Several experts said that Monday's ruling, applying the antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a powerful remedy.
That will be decided in a separate proceeding to begin within a few weeks.
Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct to breaking up the company.
Senior government officials familiar with the views of the state and federal officers who are pursuing the case said that many were interested in requesting a breakup, though no decision had been made.
The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed.
On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained unbridgeable.
Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged Monday, losing almost 14 percent of its value.
That helped fuel a broad decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent.
In his 43-page conclusions of law, Jackson's final judgment on the evidence, the judge wrote that ``the court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as ``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' all in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the law.
Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that point.
Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that Microsoft would appeal.
``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more affordable to millions,'' Gates said.
``We believe we have a strong case on appeal.''
