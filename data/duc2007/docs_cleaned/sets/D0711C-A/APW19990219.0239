The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. has been postponed from June until next January.
District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial until Jan. 17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, D.C.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has used illegal marketing and licensing tactics.
Caldera, a small firm based in Orem, contends Microsoft deliberately destroyed the public's demand for DR-DOS, a program that enables computers to perform basic functions.
One of Caldera's expert witnesses calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion.
New Microsoft filings allege internal memos show DR-DOS's own developers knew they had a flawed product and poor technical support for frustrated consumers.
``Right now we are Microsoft's biggest endorser,'' a DR-DOS adviser wrote in 1992.
``(The) majority of all the irate individuals I speak with say that they are going back to Microsoft because at least they provide support.''
The filings are aimed at sharply limiting Caldera's claims at trial.
Caldera President Bryan Sparks said Caldera's response to Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month.
``We feel we have evidence to refute every one of them,'' he said.
In court Thursday, Caldera attorney Stephen J. Hill asked Benson to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until August.
For Caldera to sue Microsoft is ``a David vs. Goliath situation,'' Hill said.
``The longer (the litigation) goes, the more it costs.''
Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal antitrust case concludes.
Rulings on Microsoft's new filings likely will require written opinions and will determine the scope of the trial, Benson said.
Those decisions will not be completed until May, only weeks before the scheduled trial, he noted.
Caldera acquired DR-DOS in 1996, along with the right to sue over Microsoft's alleged efforts to quash it.
