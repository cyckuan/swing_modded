The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because the company believed that the software trade association had become totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away.''
Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked directly against Microsoft on competition issues.''
But, he said, ``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of disagreement.''
Herbold, a member of the association's board, added that Microsoft had come to believe that was no longer true.
In a fiery reply, Ken Wasch, the group's president, said that by quitting, ``Microsoft has again proven that their tactics resemble that of a schoolyard bully.''
Since the trade group's board voted two years ago to support the government in the antitrust case, Wasch said its relationship with Microsoft had been ``a difficult one, much like the U.S. relationship with China.''
In his letter of resignation, Herbold said the group was increasingly ineffective and that its membership was ``sagging.''
Wasch replied that the Software and Information Industry Association was ``thriving.''
Microsoft paid membership fees of $125,000 a year.
The trade group's annual budget is about $8 million.
Microsoft's stock jumped more than 5 percent at one point Tuesday after a Goldman, Sachs Co. analyst, Rick Sherlund, released a research memo suggesting that settlement talks with the government in the antitrust case ``may be heating up.''
The stock price fell back to $92.875, an increase of 2.48 percent, by the close of the regular trading day.
The shadow of the antitrust suit has pushed Microsoft's share price down 25 percent from its 52-week high in recent weeks despite the introduction of its Windows 2000 operating system in February.
