His litany of accusations was lengthy and specific threats and enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp. delivered at meeting after meeting.
His charges were fleshed out with the dates, places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first representative of a PC maker to testify for the government.
David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called ``some of the most important evidence in the case.''
Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the representative witness for PC makers.
Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.
The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions.
For months, the Justice Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc., who ultimately decided against it.
Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to ``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.
On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were rejected.
But the legal standard in such cases, established in a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be ``uniquely unequivocal'' in the airline case, the evidence was a tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence.
The contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows.
No Microsoft contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must ``drop or eliminate'' OS/2.
But he insisted that the overall effect of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace.''
Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for Microsoft to offer a distributor as the IBM PC business was incentives to aggressively distribute its product.
If accepting those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 made by another unit of IBM that is mainly a business decision for IBM to make, they say.
``It will be very difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.
The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher price for Windows than its competitors.
The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp., which received a significantly lower price, Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing Windows 95 a straightforward business rationale for different terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on Microsoft's statement.
The document, an internal memo, said IBM believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.
If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.
``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.
