After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a week to settle the case before he issued a verdict.
The two sides had been talking for almost four months.
As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general who are suing Microsoft.
It included so much technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it.
But in the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough.''
If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals there.
But two officials said no new talks had been scheduled.
It remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified proposal in the next two days.
But short of that, the ongoing settlement talks, which started Nov. 30, are likely to collapse.
None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to comment.
If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy hearings.
In those hearings, the federal and state governments will propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose.
Between now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.
