Microsoft won a court appeal Tuesday today in part of the U.S. government l monopoly case against the computer giant, winning the right to tie its Internet software to its popular computer operating system.
The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed that a lower court's injunction against Microsoft was improper, and sent the matter back to the federal trial judge overseeing the antitrust case.
