Business seemed as usual at Microsoft headquarters on the first day of the U.S. government's antitrust trial against this software giant.
On Monday in Washington D.C., the federal government and 20 states kicked off the trial that accused Microsoft of illegal activities, including bullying competitors.
Back in Seattle, Washington state, where Microsoft is based, the company fired off five upbeat, product-oriented press releases and other announcements.
Its Web site on Monday carried two articles in favor of Microsoft.
One of them is entitled "Economist experts challenge underlying assumptions in government's case," quoting them as saying that the government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft is depending on theories that are not supported by the realities of the marketplace or current economic research.
The other which was carried by Los Angeles Times said that Microsoft is wrongly targeted and consumers would be losers if the government wins.
On Tuesday, Microsoft is scheduled to release its quarterly financial results, as analysts predicted another solid, high-profit quarter.
Computer Reseller News on Monday quoted a Microsoft employee as saying that "we are all concentrating on our individual jobs and only a small number of attorneys and executives are focused on the trial."
