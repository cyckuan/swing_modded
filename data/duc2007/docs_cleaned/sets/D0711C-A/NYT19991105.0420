Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth.
``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had agreed with the government.
``This case is about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the products they want,'' Reno said.
``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for the government on virtually every important point.
Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial.
Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most highly regarded litigators in the country.
At first, Boies shied away from the microphone.
But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say something.
``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said.
``Go ahead.''
Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less to do with strategy and more to do with facts.
``In some senses, this is not a surprise,'' he said.
``In a lot of ways, this is exactly what the evidence showed.''
Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision, Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is above the law.''
Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft, asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic power.''
Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly determined to remain a monopoly.
Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications.
``Today, we have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry.
But Klein deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the nationwide telephone system.
Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta of consumer protection.''
Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an example.
Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the case to Friday's decision lightning speed for such a complex case, by the usual standards of the law.
California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said he expected the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation and consumer benefit.''
``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' Lockyer said.
There was good reason for his use of ``cautiously.''
Appeals lie ahead.
Microsoft is a powerful adversary with deep pockets not as deep as the government's, but deep enough to wage a long fight, if it chooses.
And Microsoft didn't get to be Microsoft by shrinking from the battlefield.
