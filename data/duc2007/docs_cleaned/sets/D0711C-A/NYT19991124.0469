The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret deliberations.
Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company.
Posner, regarded as both an antitrust expert and a brilliant jurist, is expected to quickly assess the chances of any settlement between the two sharply divided sides.
In a meeting last Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge for the Microsoft case, told lawyers for the two sides that he had asked Posner to mediate.
At the time, Jackson noted, ``I don't think he is going to be prepared to waste a whole lot of time if it looks from the outset that it's not promising.''
If a settlement is reached, it will most likely happen in the next two months or not at all, according to another person close to the case.
``By the end of January, or it won't happen,'' he said.
Posner is serving as a mediator, not an arbiter, for the settlement talks.
There have been sporadic settlement talks between Microsoft and the government stretching back to before the suit was filed in May 1998.
Yet the previous efforts stalled.
Antitrust experts expect that Posner will try to deliver a sobering helping of reality to both sides.
They predict he will tell the government and states that their hand is as strong as it will ever be, while telling Microsoft to settle before it is hit with a final ruling that it violated the law, which could sharply increase its vulnerability to class-action lawsuits.
Final oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22 before Jackson at U.S. District Court in Washington.
