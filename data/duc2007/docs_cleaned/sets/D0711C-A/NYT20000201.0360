But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law.
The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case.
The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government, Microsoft and antitrust experts.
Unlike other filings, it is not an advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief.
Instead, he stated that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply and he raises doubts that it does Microsoft might well have violated the law.
The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system.
Microsoft asserts that the browser is not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law.''
At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty.''
Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.
If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine.''
``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products.''
Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling.''
``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its interlinkage through contract or software.''
Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.
``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible rationale for finding there were two products and a tying violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court will buy it.''
