In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp., antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that supported the government's version of the case in nearly every respect.
Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are expected sometime in the next few months.
Tuesday's presentations were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's thinking.
Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides remain divided.
Tuesday's courtroom statements uncompromising attacks from each side only seemed to underline the gap between the government and Microsoft.
At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to ``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry.
His counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong.''
The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have elements of a loss-limitation strategy.
Warden began by saying that Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the judge's findings of fact.
He then went on to tell Jackson that his ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the high-tech economy.
The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's ``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving industry.''
And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals.
``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the subject with such arguments.
Fierce competition is one thing, the government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based cases.''
And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses and documents show.''
And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly.''
