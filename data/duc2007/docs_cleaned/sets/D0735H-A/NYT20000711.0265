The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one killed.
By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there were only a few hundred left.
But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the federal Endangered Species Act.
``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all federal protection in 30 states.
Endangered species get more legal protection than threatened species.
Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
However, some federal officials believe reduced protections for wolves may actually improve prospects for reintroducing them here by easing private land owners' fears that the wolf's arrival would trigger serious limits on the use of their land.
But activists who have been pushing to bring the wolf back to the Northeast rejected that logic.
They called Babbitt's plan to ``downlist'' protections for wolves a concession to the ranchers, sheep farmers and land owners who see wolves as a hazard to their businesses.
Changing the wolves from endangered to threatened ``is a purely political move with no biological basis whatsoever,'' said Michael Kellett, executive director of Restore the North Woods, which supports reintroduction of wolves in the Northeast.
``We're going to urge people to support the strongest recovery plan possible, and to oppose the downlisting.''
Currently, wolves are considered endangered in all of the lower 48 states except Minnesota.
They would remain so in the Southwest under Babbitt's proposal, which would be final a year from now after public hearings.
Even if wolves are downlisted to threatened, it would still be illegal to shoot them.
If the proposal survives the public debate ahead, it would signify an extraordinary compromise between critics and supporters of wolf recovery.
Critics have included private property groups and many states, including New Hampshire where the legislature approved a bill last year banning wolf reintroduction there.
On the other side, environmental groups have played on the wolf's charisma to build support for reintroducing the animal.
The compromise is evident in the Service's plan to involve critics and supporters in writing the recovery plan, the document that will guide efforts to build up wolf populations.
And, under a special rule included in the proposal for the Northeast, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise threaten people and property could be shot or relocated.
Such concessions are intended to appease landowners and legislators alike, who may fear the federal government even more than the wolves.
``This would give us quite a bit more flexibility,'' said Paul Nickerson, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast regional endangered species office.
``Unlike other areas of the country, where there is a great deal of public land, whatever recovery we do here will occur on private land, with the full cooperation of private landowners.''
To the timber industry, which owns millions of acres in the four states and has been uneasy about wolf recovery, such overtures are welcome.
They are nervous that wolves may wander into Maine from Canada, potentially triggering all sorts of efforts to protect the animals at their expense.
So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a current population.
Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
``Because of the many restrictions that often follow Endangered Species Act listings, it'd be a stretch to say our members would be thankful if wolves actually do show up in Maine,'' said Andrew Kekacs, a spokesman for the Maine Forest Products Council.
