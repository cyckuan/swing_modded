federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
The 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
They also claim that the program is unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only a few lone native wolves.
The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock.
The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering threatened animals.
The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision sets an important precedent.
``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision has ``enormous significance nationwide.''
Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf reintroduction program.''
Jon Robinett, who says his livestock has been attacked repeatedly by wolves at his ranch in Dubois, Wyo., about 40 miles from Yellowstone, was disappointed with the ruling.
``Maybe they weren't well-versed in the Endangered Species Act.''
In 1997, U.S. District Judge William Downes ordered the reintroduced wolves removed but stayed his ruling pending the decision by the federal appeals court.
