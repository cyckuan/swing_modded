Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year.
The latest killing has environmentalists calling for FBI and National Guard intervention.
Also, new evidence says a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the wolves' slaughter.
Ironically, that is the same amount the federal government and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers.

Pretty soon, the University of Arizona is going to get it over with, and just rename the place Rogers University.
Alumnus James Rogers on Tuesday became one of the largest benefactors in the history of higher education, donating $100 million to the UA law school, with the possibility that the gift will climb to $130 million.
If that occurs, it will be one of the five largest gifts in American academic history.
Rogers had the law school named after him last week, and will sit on the board of the foundation that will administer his gift.
Is he perhaps getting too influential?

The promise of sunny skies, a casual lifestyle and friendly people lured Barbara Griffin from Pittsburgh to Arizona this year, nudging the state closer to overcoming a shortage of up to 10,000 nurses.
But not nearly close enough.
So hospitals in Phoenix and Tucson are offering free trips to Hawaii, signing bonuses of up to $6,000 and other incentives to attract nurses willing to work long hours under stressful conditions.
Some who already have jobs in Phoenix say they're so worn out that they welcome all the help they can get.

Thirteen-year-old Andy wore two or three pairs of underwear under his jeans and slept fully dressed in the months after he got home from spending half a year in foster care.
Now 14, Andy averts his eyes when he talks about what happened to him in that shelter in Mesa in late 1996 and 1997.
Andy was taken from his mother because child welfare officials said their house was too filthy.
`Basically,'' the boy says, sinking down in a cushioned chair in his mother's office, ``I was raped.''
As many as 250 Arizona children were sexually abused while in foster care over a decade, according to a lawsuit filed in Tucson in 1994.
Pima County Presiding Judge Michael Brown is considering whether to grant class action status to the lawsuit.

In a back alley off Main Street in Mesa, Ariz., hundreds of teenagers and young adults converge in a kaleidoscopic tangle, dressed like sci-fi conventiongoers on their way to an all-night slumber party.
They're jittery with a can't-wait feeling, knowing they'll soon be psychicly free-falling through a rave, a form of all-night, semi-clandestine partying that has re-invented itself again and again over the past 10 years.
It has becomes more slick, commercial and global in its reach.
There's a rave every weekend in the Phoenix area, drawing at least 1,000 young people, who find their way to the site by dialing up a recorded message or clicking on a Web site.
Drugs are part of the scene to some degree.
But more important are the opportunities a rave offers for losing yourself in pulsating music, escaping your frustrations, feeling free enough to fly.
