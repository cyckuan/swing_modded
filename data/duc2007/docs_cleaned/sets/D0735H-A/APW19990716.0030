pack of Mexican gray wolves that repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being relocated.
The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate the pack to an area free of livestock.
Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, instead of deer, elk and other wildlife.
``They tried an experiment in that location and it didn't work and they're responding,'' said C.B.
Lane, director of natural resources for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, which opposes the reintroduction program.
``It gives us a good feeling that the government does understand that there's more to life than just where the wildlife are.''
On Thursday, federal wildlife officials said they have confirmed two attacks on calves, including a death Sunday.
Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not participated, in the calf killing.
Federal officials said there have been other instances where wolves chased cattle but were driven off by people.
Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near extinction by the 1970s.
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
Five captive-born wolves released last year were killed and others were re-captured.
