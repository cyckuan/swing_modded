Act on millions of acres of private lands has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing species protected by the Act.
The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal government.
They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log or otherwise use their property.
In return, the landowners agree to make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered plants or animals.
The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and they're spreading rapidly.
The areas covered by the habitat conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as ``innovative'' and ``helpful.''
He said it is spurring his agency to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk species.
Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species' survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the species actually fare, the study says.
The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close to a guess.''
The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat, to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.
And large landowners, especially timber companies in the Northwest, have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans.
They have negotiated or are working on agreements that would effect about 11 million acres in Washington, Oregon California, Idaho and Montana.
That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial timberland in the region.
In recent years, the plans have drawn mounting criticism from environmental groups and some conservation biologists.
It found: No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about two-thirds of the species covered.
Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the species' survival was ``especially common.''
Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring programs that were sufficient for evaluating success.''
About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100 years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked, without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide adequate species protection.
Laverne Smith, chief of Interior's Division of Endangered Species, declined to respond to any of the draft's specific criticisms.
She said a formal response is being drafted.
The study, which eclipses previous habitat planning reviews in both depth and scope, was coordinated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara with financial assistance from the National Science Foundation and the American Institute for Biological Sciences.
The scientists from eight universities evaluated 208 of 227 habitat plans, with an in-depth look at 43 of them.
Though still subject to revisions, the draft study expands on findings reported in December.
At that time, Peter Kareiva, the University of Washington ecologist who supervised the study, said, ``There are a huge number of Habitat Conservatin Plans (HCPs) that probably should not have been written.''
Kareiva could not be reached for comment on the latest version of the report.
The White House announced in February it intends to improve HCP guidelines.
Interior Department officials have been working on language to require plans to have clear monitoring programs, measurable biological goals and more public review.
And, where information is lacking, the government is seeking shorter duration and more clauses that would force landowners to tighten safeguards if new species problems developed.
In a recent interview, Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as necessary growing pains for a new program.
``Obviously, this stuff is all new and we're cutting it out of whole cloth,'' Babbitt said.
``We've got a couple hundred HCPs.
Now, what we have to do is go back and look at all of them and see if there are lessons we can learn.''
Federal officials noted that the plans cannot be delayed for perfect data and are negotiated compromises, not pure science.
The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters.
In 1996, 167 scientists complained about the plans' lack of independent scientific review and warned they ``have the potential to become habitat giveaways that contribute to, rather than alleviate, threats to listed species and their habitats.''
Several environmental groups and members of congress have also raised concerns.
``Giving it all away'' is what a coalition of Northwest environmental groups last year called a review of the plans.
One notable exception to the environmental group critics is Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund, a highly regarded expert on on U.S. wildlife law.
Bean agrees that some of the plans are ``lousy,'' but says they can produce net gains.
``HCPs have the potential to produce results that are far better than we could otherwise expect,'' he said, especially where human intervention is needed to restore habitat or combat an invasive exotic species.
