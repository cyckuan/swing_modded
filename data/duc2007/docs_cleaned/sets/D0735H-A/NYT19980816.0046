The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf.
Unfortunately, this small female was the mother of the only pup born in the wild that still was there.
Biologists may try to provide food for the motherless pup and attempt to keep it in the wild.
An alternative would be to capture it and raise it in captivity.
Another wolf was shot by a camper, who said he killed the animal after it attacked his dog.
The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service won't prosecute the camper.
But the death of the female wolf seems more compelling because it apparently happened during a conflict with another predator namely a mountain lion, perhaps the most formidable killer in the state.
But before the confrontation could be figured out completely, federal agents had to determine whether a crime had been committed.
Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death was treated as a crime scene.
It's against the law to kill a member of an endangered species.
The wolf's remains were sent to experts for examination.
``That was the first thought.''
When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and was challenged by the wolf.
Perhaps it should have been, but taking out this wolf was no easy task for the lion, according to Phelps.
``The whole hillside was torn up,'' he said.
``There apparently was a pretty good fight.
Usually, a lion will grab the back of the neck and break it or grab the throat and suffocate when it attacks.
This was a small wolf, but it put up a good fight.
This was not typical of a lion kill.''
Some of the wolves have shown signs of their inexperience in the wild.
There have been reports that some have shown little fear of humans.
There was speculation that the dead wolf, probably having never encountered a lion, didn't know how formidable this foe would be.
But she obviously was aggressive.
``That's the kind of wolf you'd like out there (if the species is going to re-establish itself),'' Phelps said.
``It's too bad she had to die.
``She was just too aggressive.''
Information growing In the next few weeks, Game and Fish should have available on its Internet site a unit-by-unit breakdown of hunting information on both small and big game, according to Bob Miles, a public information officer for the department who is organizing the service.
Only bison will be excluded.
The information will be compiled from the reports of wildlife managers in the various units, who work the field in those areas.
There will be reports on quail and other small game plus reports on big-game populations.
``This isn't an attempt to tell hunters which rocks to hunt under,'' Miles said.
``But it will be an overview with specific information on each unit.
It will give them a general place to start.
``It should be a tremendous help to hunters especially for small-game stuff.
It will be more basic for big game.
But it will give good access information.''
Miles, who once worked in the Tucson region, said a similar Internet page was developed there and became the most popular part of the region's Web site.
The information also will be available in hard copy at Game and Fish's regional offices free of charge.
Target date is about Sept. 1.
