The government proposed Tuesday to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change.
That means authorities would have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into account concerns from private landowners.
Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S.
But she said the increase in the number of wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people.''
While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as ''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.
Those include vast areas of the West and even parts of New England, they said.
But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
''We made the right choice to ... bring these animals back from the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant reclassification.
The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's range.
''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of Defenders of Wildlife.
He said he wasn't opposed to the reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could lose federal protection entirely.
The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal ''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
Under the proposal, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service would establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
