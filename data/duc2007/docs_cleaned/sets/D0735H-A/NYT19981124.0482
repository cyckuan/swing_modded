The latest wolf death has environmentalists calling for FBI intervention, while some ranchers say now is a good time to abandon the experiment.
Meanwhile, there are allegations that a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the wolves' slaughter.
Coincidentally, that is the same amount the federal government and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers.
For now, there are only four wolves remaining in the wild, and none is running free.
The two surviving males from the original group of 11 brought to the wilds of Arizona in January the first wild wolves in the Southwest in 28 years were recaptured this week.
There were placed in pens with two new females Babbitt delivered last week from the New Mexico ranch of cable-TV mogul Ted Turner.
Those four wolves will be released in about two months, and four more wolf packs will arrive this winter.
The latest wolf killing occurred near Hawley Lake, on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, between Show Low and Springerville.
Like four others, the wolf appeared to have been shot, said Tom Bauer, spokesman for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque.
Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
Barbara Marks, a rancher and spokeswoman for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, said now is a good time to end the program, since all the wolves have been rounded up and none is running wild.
``How much money do they have to spend before they admit that it's a failure, for the wolves and for the community?
It's been a cruel experiment,'' said Marks, who lives in the isolated Blue Primitive Area, which has been the primary wolf release area.
In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the wolf killers to $50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all three areas; the government should close unneeded roads in the Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range; and ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf releases.
``They may not have pulled the actual trigger.
But by creating this anti-wolf climate up there, they have encouraged whoever did it,'' Suckling said.
Two leaders of Santa Fe environmental groups Pat Wolff of New West Research, and Sam Hitt of Forest Guardians said the federal government has failed to fully investigate information they have collected that they say points to wolf bounties of up to $35,000 being offered by an as yet unidentified man from Catron County, N.M.
They said a tape recording they obtained of a federal prison inmate in Tucson indicates a wolf bounty was being offered by someone affiliated with the New Mexico ranching groups.
``That's laughable,'' said Caren Cowen, executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
``Patricia Wolff has really gone off the deep end this time.
``We are pursuing our case through the courts.
There is no reason to go out and senselessly and needlessly kill an animal.''
Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered Species Act of $100,000 and a year in prison, but they also would risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands.
Hitt, of Forest Guardians, also has called on Babbitt to bring in the FBI, saying the law enforcement officers of the Fish and Wildlife Service are prone to intimidation by ranchers and not backed up by their superiors.
Babbitt said more federal officers are already assigned to the case and there is no need to involve the FBI, but if the help of other federal agencies is needed, he will call for it.
Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot, three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and presumed dead, and four remain.
In addition, the pup of one of the wolves killed the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century also is missing and presumed dead.
Bobbie Holaday of Phoenix, the 76-year-old retired computer systems analyst that led the decadelong charge to return the wolves, called the wolf killings ``beyond comprehension.''
``It's so .
