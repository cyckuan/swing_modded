Maybe it's just the ``w'' word wolves.
The reintroduction of the nearly extinct Mexican wolf into the American Southwest has initiated an emotional argument that seems to go way beyond the paltry numbers involved.
The wolf is a creature able to stir passion; the species has such a dark hold of human imagination that rational debate may be impossible.
Rick Bass has entered the circle with the credentials to be fair.
The Texas native from deep in the heart of often-militant opposition to wolves is a conservationist and a hunter.
The author has set the ambitious goal of being both journalistic and literary in ``The New Wolves'' (Lyons; $18.95).
He has made his 166-page book readable and enlightening, though a few lapses weaken the vivid picture he has painted.
Bass does a good job of setting up the situation before the return of Mexican wolves to Eastern Arizona's Blue Range: The slaughter of the wolf and other predators paralleled the killing of bison and Indians.
Bass introduces biologists and volunteers inspired by the idea of reintroduction, interviews a ranching couple who favor holistic management, making no attempt to kill predators, and a gadfly who believes the program is doomed to failure, another example of questionable government planning.
Yet nowhere does Bass interview the ranchers who would just as soon kill the wolves on sight because they pose a threat to livestock on the parched and often overgrazed land.
Bass does note that each rancher losing any of his herd will be compensated and that the losses would surely be minimal.
He is sympathetic to the wolves' plight; however, the views of detractors whose voices must be heard in an open-minded forum are nowhere in these pages.
Regardless, the author shows a delicate touch.
Describing the release of the wolves into the wild, he writes, ``Their eyes carry more than ours do.''
He provides fine profiles of the beasts and their territories.
But he falls into the role of a mystic, and it can be grating.
He gets so carried away that he resorts to extravagant metaphors that are unnecessarily intrusive: ``Do the increases in rumors reflect that the wolves are already there, or do the increases in rumor compress to a point of saturation, a density of desire in the air, that is finally sufficient to lure and welcome wolves back into that land, as a weather system rolls from a high-pressure area into a low, or as the tides follow the moon and the Earth?''
Come on.
To his credit, Bass has sketched the basic details of the story and there's a lot of good writing.
But readers will find the book not a meal but an appetizer.
Our rating: HH { If ever there were a true recreational mecca, Colorado's Rocky Mountains fit the bill.
For a memorable trip to the ``backbone of the world'' without many on-trail Sig Alerts, two titles could steer you in the right direction: Different problems limit the appeal of Gerry Roach's ``Colorado's Indian Peaks: Classic Hikes and Climbs'' (Fulcrum; $16.95).
Triathlon types will be the main audience.
Weekend warriors better stay at home; there are no hikes for beginners.
The Boulder, Colo., author is a world-class mountaineer who has climbed Mount Everest and was only the second climber to scale the highest peak on every continent.
He has climbed all of Colorado's 14,000-plus-feet pinnacles and displays an expert knowledge of the region described in the 180-page no-nonsense guidebook.
The topographic maps are good and directions concise for the 21 trailheads, 29 hikes, 49 peaks and 127 routes.
But there's another number one, as in (begin ital)the(end ital) big question: What is special about this region?
The mediocre black-and-white photos certainly don't show it.
Every area is unique in some way; if not, why travel so far to get there?
Our rating: HH Maurizio Valerio has compiled a list of the best outdoor businesses in ``Top Rated Rocky Mountain Adventures'' (Picked-By-You Guides; $18.95).
Ratings are based on service, knowledge and performance.
Categories include big-game and bird hunting, fly-fishing and other angling, wilderness adventures and whitewater trips.
But there are some major gaps in the 278 pages.
The author has failed to include any price information; these kinds of trips could be fabulous, and fabulously expensive.
Maps are also inadequate.
