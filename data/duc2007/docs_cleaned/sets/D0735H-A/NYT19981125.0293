The rapid beeping of a radio collar on the yearling male wolf a few weeks ago signaled the end of Mexican gray wolves in the wild for now, at least.
The transmission from the collar indicated that the wolf had stopped moving, and trackers found it dead several days later near the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona.
It was the fifth rare Mexican gray wolf found dead, apparently from a gunshot, since 11 of the animals were released into the wild in a recovery program last spring.
``There are no Mexican wolves free in the wild today,'' said Tom Bauer, assistant regional director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife's Southwest Office in Albuquerque, N.M. Of the 11 wolves released in this inaugural year of the recovery program, five have been killed, one is missing and presumed dead, and five have been returned to captivity for breeding in acclimation pens near Alpine, Ariz. One pup born in the wild is missing and presumed dead since his mother was shot in August.
One shooting in April was accounted for when a camper said he mistook the wolf for a coyote that was endangering his family.
Necropsy reports are expected to determine the cause of death of the other animals.
Since the latest killing was reported, there has been talk of a conspiracy to eliminate the wolves.
But Nancy Kaufman, regional director of the wildlife office, said, ``We really don't have, despite what people want to think, evidence of a conspiracy to kill the wolves.
These killings have sabotaged the program, they have set the program back substantially.
However, we are going forward with the program, and reviewing our techniques and adding law enforcement.''
The Albuquerque Journal reported that a wildlife activist had met with an Arizona prisoner who said he had been offered $35,000 by a New Mexico rancher to kill all wolves reintroduced into the wild.
Wildlife activists say it has not been uncommon in the Southwest for ranchers to offer a bounty for predators such as mountain lions.
We in no way condone the needless and senseless shooting of animals for any reason, and no, we don't know who's doing this.''
Ms. Cowan said her organization is one a handful that has pursued legal avenues to stop the reintroduction of the wolves, and admitted the wolves had not been as problematic as anticipated.
``This is not the big, bad wolf the ranchers make them out to be,'' said Shane Jimerfield, assistant director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz. ``The wolves have exceeded all expectations of recovery, the only problem they are having is with humans, not the natural environment.''
Jimerfield said a reward of $35,000 has been offered by wildlife organizations and the government for information leading to the arrest of whoever is killing the wolves.
Because the Mexican gray wolf, or ``lobo,'' as it is regionally known, is an endangered species, the punishment for killing one is a $100,000 fine and up to six months in prison.
Ranchers brought the animals to extinction around the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century.
In the past decade, two sub-species of gray wolf have been reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park and wilderness areas of Idaho.
