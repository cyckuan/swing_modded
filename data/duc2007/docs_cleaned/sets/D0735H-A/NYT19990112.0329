Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today (WED. JAN 13) in the Apache National Forest.
Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter perhaps as many as 17.
Some wolves may even arrive by helicopter as researchers attempt to keep the captive-bred wolves as wild as possible by releasing them in the most inaccessible parts of the forest.
``My goal is to make these wolves as wild as possible, and keep them wild,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, Mexican wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
All the wolves released this winter sport bright orange, pink or yellow markings on their fur and their radio-location collars, an attempt to prevent hunters from mistaking them for coyotes.
Meanwhile, environmentalists continue to post a $50,000 reward for the arrest of those responsible for last year's wolf killings, while ranchers continue their opposition to the reintroductions with a new federal court petition.
``You have a government program that can destroy an individual and his private property,'' said Sam Luce, a rancher along the isolated Blue River whose trained cow dog, Pepi, was killed by a wolf last year.
Despite fears expressed by ranchers and others, no cattle, sheep or people have been killed or injured by the wolves, which generally feed on overpopulated herds of wild elk.
Federal biologists plan to re-establish a self-supporting population of at least 100 wolves in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico by 2005.
At that point, the wolves might be removed from the federal Endangered Species List.
The lobos of the Southwest are the rarest subspecies of wolf in North America, and their recovery is the No.
