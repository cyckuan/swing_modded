In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program.
The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.
Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.
In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots.
Most of the latter killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated, making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a single Rockies population.
And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last year.
One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary.
The Jackson pack has adopted the National Elk Refuge as its winter hunting ground.
One could sit in Jackson this winter, ``sipping your latte and watching nature at work'' as the wolves hunted down elk, Bangs said.
In another ecological milestone, he said, one Yellowstone pack has learned to attack and kill bison in the park and is now something of a bison specialist.
The Yellowstone wolves generally have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves.
Nearly $70,000 in compensation was paid to the affected owners from a fund maintained by the Defenders of Wildlife, according to a report by Bangs and others in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin.
Forty-seven wolves were moved after depredations, and 43 marauding wolves have been killed.
By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle, valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
The case is now on appeal.
As a practical matter, Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established that removing them would be a problem.
``You could remove all the wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive.''
Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find.
``To recapture all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
``We are dad-gum close to the countdown'' to that day, said Bangs.
