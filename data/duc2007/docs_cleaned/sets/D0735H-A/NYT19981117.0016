Under crystal skies, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt carried two burdens Monday into the pine-studded forests of eastern Arizona.
One was a heavy steel cage.
Inside was one of two endangered Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and Gila national forests.
The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of the Southwest in nearly three decades.
``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,'' he said.
Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are kept in check.
Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the killer or killers to justice.
And he promised to return again this winter, when four additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first wolf in April a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of self-defense.
He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents.
But when pressed for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just rather not comment on it.''
The interior secretary, who heads the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of his family was under attack.
And he said it remains true that there is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this century ever attacking a human being.
``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News.''
Sagi said he closed shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for Humphrey.
Still, Sagi said whoever killed the wolves recently should consult an attorney and turn themselves in to the authorities.
``Whether a series of accidents or deliberate sabotage, one thing is for sure: The recent killings are a monolithic catastrophe in the effort to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf, and speak volumes about the need for coalition building in this and any federal effort that potentially impacts recreation and property rights,'' Sagi said.
Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with the local community.
