Robert Smith led the leashed gray wolf Tatonka toward 50 nervous students Thursday at Van Nuys High School, where the mascot is a wolf.
The yellow-eyed, 125-pound canine can exert three times more jaw pressure than a German shepherd, enough to rip a human arm off, warned Smith, ranch manager for Wolves -N- Wildlife, a Fillmore educational group.
For a few tense moments, the teen-agers sat silently, not knowing what to expect next.
``Oh, how cute,'' 17-year-old junior Anush Artenyan said finally, breaking the silence and bringing smiles to her classmates.
Smith brought the 1{-year-old wolf to school to show the students wolves are one of the world's most misunderstood animal.
``We teach kids the wolf is not the evil animal in `Little Red Riding Hood,''' Smith said.
`It's actually a gentle animal that will not hunt you down.
It's not the devil.''
Actually, Tatonka was raised in captivity and is used to being around humans.
Helen Champion, executive director of Mercy Crusade, Inc., a Thousand Oaks-based animal humane organization that sponsored the event, said she hopes the students understand the importance of protecting endangered wildlife like wolves.
``Being the school is the home of the Wolves, this was perfect.
The school is now interested in adopting this wolf as its mascot.''
For student 17-year-old student Alisa Akilyan, the experience with the wolf was a memorable one, but she wanted to get closer.
``The eyes attracted me from far away,'' she said.
``When I saw the wolf, I noticed he wouldn't attack people.
Wolves -N- Wildlife is an educational wildlife group located on a 120-acre ranch in Fillmore, also home to nine other wolves, a Siberian tiger and a black bear.
At one time, wolves ranged all over the United States in large numbers, but traps and poison made them virtually extinct by 1930, he said.
In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species list.
Since then, wolves have been reintroduced in some western states and now number about 5,000, Smith said.
