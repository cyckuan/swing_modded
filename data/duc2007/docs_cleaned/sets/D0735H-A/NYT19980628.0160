The Interior Department will announce on Monday that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes, because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from extinction.
Department officials said they believed it was time to remove about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their numbers increase.
The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers increase.
Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted almost to extinction.
The rugged canines with the haunting howl have loped through primeval forests just as they prowl the human psyche in myth, folk tale and nursery rhyme.
Today, they have recaptured a revered status among conservation groups, reflecting their important ecological role as a top predator.
In interviews, Babbitt and Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said the changes would not lessen the likelihood that wolf packs would continue to thrive and to extend into new territories.
Babbitt plans to explain the policies on Monday while visiting a wildlife science center in Minnesota where the animals are held captive to help rebuild their numbers.
The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, reproducing successfully, even though these populations might be reclassified from endangered to threatened.
Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast.
Gray wolves in Alaska have never been listed as endangered or threatened.
Formal proposals will be published in a few months.
The changes in the wolves' legal status are not likely to occur before 1999, but officials said the department's intentions were unlikely to change.
``One reason the Endangered Species Act was in question was the opponents were saying it did not work.''
The department's proposals for managing wolves have long been contentious, but this time some conservation groups are willing to support easing the protection.
``We think it is the right thing for the wolves, at the right time,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Foundation.
``It is the way the Endangered Species Act was designed to work.''
Proponents of relaxing the protections for wolves say that the change will make it easier to convince farmers and ranchers that the wolves can expand into new areas without threatening their livelihoods.
The wolves eat anything from small animals like mice and rabbits to larger species like sheep and cattle.
When the population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction.
The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed.
No wolf recovery plan has been drafted for the Northeast, but proponents believe that the Adirondacks and Maine provide suitable conditions, and planning may now begin.
Although it might be possible for wolves to move naturally back into the Northeast from Canada, little migration has been detected.
The government is far from committing to a reintroduction of the wolves, but the legal doors have cracked open.
``Do we have immediate plans for reintroduction?
No,'' Ms. Clark of the Fish and Wildlife Service said.
``But there is suitable habitat, there is a potential opportunity, there are suitable prey species.''
In the Northeast, moose and white-tail deer would be among the gray wolf's prey.
``Part of the vision for the grand Laurentian forest from the Adirondacks up to Maine is to bring back the wolves,'' Van Putten said.
``We think the proposal Secretary Babbitt is going to announce will make it more likely that that will happen.''
