the end of another successful day of elk hunting in the heart of eastern Arizona wolf country.
``There's nothing wrong with wolves,'' said Collins, a hunter, miner and coppersmith who lives in the hills near Silver City, N.M. ``(But) I will shoot a wolf on sight, and I'd like the FBI tagging along.
You are not going to tell me what to do.''
If Collins' view seems contradictory, it reflects a deep-rooted conflict many folks along the Arizona-New Mexico line have about the federal government's program this year to repopulate the Apache and Gila national forests with endangered Mexican gray wolves.
Many here say they are not so much against the wolves, as they are against what the wolf represents: the steady erosion of a Western lifestyle dependent on mining, ranching and logging.
Five of the wolves have been shot to death, a federal crime that carries a potential fine of $100,000 and a year in prison.
The mystery surrounding the killings has led to claims of death threats received by ranchers and environmentalists.
But no one has been harmed, and no sheep or cattle have been eaten by wolves.
Between conflicting theories of intentional sabotage and random accidents, Collins shares another theory that the wolves were intentionally shot by different people in opportunistic moments of frustration.
``What's the big deal?
You see a wolf, you shoot a wolf,'' said Max Schowengerdt, a former Las Vegas, Nev., construction contractor who recently retired to the mountains of western New Mexico.
To these hunters, the potential suspects in the wolf shootings could include anyone in the economically depressed region, which has an unemployment rate three times the states' averages.
``Every truck that goes down this street has a gun in it.
Does that mean they're militia?
No.
