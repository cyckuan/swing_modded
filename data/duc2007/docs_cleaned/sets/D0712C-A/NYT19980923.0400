The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
``We're working to achieve a resolution to the problem that is going to be acceptable to both sides,'' said a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
``We've always taken the opportunity to press for assurances of Salman Rushdie's safety, and that is what Robin Cook will be doing when he meets Kamal Kharazi tomorrow.''
Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York that ``we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely finished.''
But Britain has always insisted that nothing short of a complete lifting of the death sentence, as well as the revocation of the $2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head pledged by a revolutionary foundation in Tehran, would be an acceptable solution.
After he wrote the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Rushdie was accused of blasphemy against Islam and condemned to death in a religious decree by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989.
Since then, he has lived in safe houses around London, guarded around the clock by British agents.
Rushdie and several representatives from the International Rushdie Defense Committee met with members of the Foreign Office on Wednesday and the committee issued a statement saying that it remained ``cautiously optimistic'' about Thursday's meeting.
Although the Iranian government has said in the past that it would not actively encourage anyone to kill Rushdie, it has never explicitly revoked the death sentence, nor canceled the bounty.
