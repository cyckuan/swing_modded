Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological students have pledged a month's salary toward a bounty for the killing of British author Salman Rushdie, an Iranian newspaper reported Saturday.
The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous.
In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with Iran after Tehran distanced itself from the bounty.
But the move has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of the government of President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict against Salman Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
``Thousands have also signed up to give a month's wages to any person who carries out the historical edict against Salman Rushdie,'' the Farsi-language newspaper added.
Seminary students in Qom receive monthly stipends of about 200,000 rials (dlrs 66) and teachers earn about 300,000 rials (dlrs 100).
Last month a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
The move followed the government's distancing itself from the reward.
Last month residents of a north Iranian village offered land and carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.
