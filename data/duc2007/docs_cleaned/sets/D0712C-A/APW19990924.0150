Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him.
``It is not 100 percent normal, but compared to what the last 10 years have been like, it is better,'' the ``Satanic Verses'' author said at a news conference Friday.
He said the lifting of the death sentence would allow him to focus on being a novelist rather than the center of a political debate.
The writer was in Liege to receive an honorary doctorate in literature from Liege University.
