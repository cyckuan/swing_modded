The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini ... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
Last week, more half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament signed a letter saying the death edict against Rushdie still stands.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.
