private Iranian foundation has raised its reward for killing British author Salman Rushdie from 2 million U.S. dollars to 2.5 million dollars.
However, President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared in a press conference held here today that the reward has nothing to do with the government, claiming, "The government policy still remains the same."
The Persian Daily Jumhuri Islami reported today that Ayatollah Sheikh Jassan Sanai'e, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and head of the Khordad Foundation, has announced the decision for raising the reward.
The report said that the clergyman made the announcement on the occasion of the 8th anniversary of the issuance of the decree on the Indian-born author of the book of "Satanic Verses."
Muslim fundamentalists, who consider the book blasphemous for its irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, reacted very strongly after the book was published in 1989.
Sanai'e said that the interests on the reward money would also be paid to the executor of the decree right from the beginning, adding, "There is nothing more to the foundation than seeing Imam Khomeini's decree executed."
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
However, Iran, given tremendous pressures from the European Union (EU) after the death of Khomeini, has promised not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
Iranian authorities reportedly face tremendous pressure and opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the issue.
