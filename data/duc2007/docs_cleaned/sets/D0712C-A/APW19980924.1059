British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said.
``It means everything.''
Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the development that came out British talks with Iran in New York, Rushdie said: ``It seems that this has been done in Iran with consensus.''
Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream opposition within Iran.
``An extraordinary thing has been achieved,'' Rushdie said.
Publication of Salman Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988 caused an uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that it insulted Islam.
The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty on the Indian-born British writer's head.
At the United Nations in New York, Iran's foreign minister said his government was distancing itself from the reward for killing Rushdie, and was ready to exchange ambassadors with Britain.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's decision.
``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our relations,'' Cook said after the meeting.
