hard-line Iranian student group has offered 1 billion riyals (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
The move came just weeks after the relatively moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from the death edict and an earlier reward of dlrs 2.5 million.
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook, had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333 to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday.
It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini ... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
Last week, more than half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.
