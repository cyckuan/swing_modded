Iran declared here today that it will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference here that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie affairs.
"We think there is room for such an action at different international forums including the U.N.," he said.
Speaking through an interpreter to an international corps of reporters here to report on March 8th parliamentary elections, he stressed that the concept of freedom in the West led to violations of the rights of others.
While answering the question by Xinhua, Mirsalim said "Iran is planning to take the issue of insulting religious sanctities, which has resulted in the Rushdie issue, to the international bodies, including to the U.N.." "We believe that there is a deviation inherent in the concept of freedom in some of the Western societies that tramples the rights of the most people in the world," he said.
"If the cultural community and the authors in the West had been committed to respecting the religious beliefs of the people, a problem such as Salman Rushdie would have never emerged," he added.
He added that his ministry was committed to defend Islamic culture and rejected allegations by critics that his ministry took sides with the religious conservatives.
"Being neutral does not mean anything.
We have to defend the Islamic culture," he said.
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said during his recent trip to central Asian states that Iran will resume talks with the European Union (EU) on the Rushdie issue.
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Liberal weekly Bahman reported in February that former deputy guidance minister, Ahmad Masjed Jame'ie, resigned over differences pertaining the new restrictions imposed on authors.
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance came under heavy attacks in 1995 by the religious conservatives that took the ministry for allowing the publication of romantic novels.
In a sudden about-face in its publication policy, the ministry declared that authors have to receive permission prior to publication of their books.
