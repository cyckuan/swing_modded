Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that his government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, paving the way for upgrading strained ties with the United Kingdom.
The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,'' Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart, Robin Cook.
