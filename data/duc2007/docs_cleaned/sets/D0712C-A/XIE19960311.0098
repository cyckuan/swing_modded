Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries.
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference this morning that "the death sentence was never meant to be carried out."
Rafsanjani attacked Europe, especially Britain, for their lack of resolve to solve the issue.
He said: "The Europeans, especially the British, made hue and cry over it.
Even now they do not allow it to be solved."
"The fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini can be found in all the books on Islamic law for the past 1,000 years.
He only said something which existed in these books," Rafsanjani added.
"We really do not think it is prudent that we would dwell on this issue so much," he added.
Observers here said that the indirect Tehran-EU talks on Salman Rushdie is producing some understanding.
The two sides have agreed that the case should be regarded merely as a religious and theoretical issue.
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
In 1993, Rafsanjani told prominent Egyptian journalist Muhammad Hassanein Haykal that there was a difference between a fatwa and hokm .
He said that Khomeini did not mean the death sentence to be a command.
An observer here said that with U.S. pressure mounting on Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to gain cooperation of the European Union.
"The Iranians no longer want any of the troubles they went through over the Rushdie issue," one observer said.
"The question is not whether but how to withdraw from previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home and abroad," he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as the Rushdie affair.
