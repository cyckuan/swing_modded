Iran warned on Sunday it's ties with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues support for Salman Rushdie, a British writer condemned to death by Iran for his "blasphemous" novel.
"The continuation of the offensive policies by Norway might force Iran to further limit its ties with the country," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Iran's late Spiritual Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei for his novel "the Satanic Verses," which was regarded as an insult to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.
Reacting to a recent meeting between Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and Rushdie, Mohammadi said "the meeting constituted a support for Rushdie's desecration of Islamic sanctities."
He said Norway's move defied the new international consensus which views understanding among nations and dialogue among cultures and civilizations necessary for peaceful coexistence in the world.
Iran and Norway recalled their ambassadors in December 1994 over Norway's support for Rushdie and their ties have since been kept at the level of charge d'affaires.
Mohammadi said the restrictions Iran imposed on its commercial and political relations with Norway would continue "unabatedly."
