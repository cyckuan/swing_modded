About 1,000 hard-liners, many of them militia volunteers, demonstrated outside Tehran University on Tuesday, shouting that the religious edict against writer Salman Rushdie remained in force.
The demonstration occurred as Abdollah Nouri, a deputy to moderate President Mohammad Khatami, delivered a speech at the university on civil liberties.
One of the hard-liners tried to hit Nouri as he was leaving the campus, but four body guards protected him and whisked him away in his car.
Nouri, who is a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was attacked along with Ataollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, on Sept. 4 by militants.
The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie.
``The edict is irrevocable, and we emphasize the implementation of this edict against apostate Salman Rushdie independent of any diplomatic negotiations conducted by Iran's government,'' said a statement distributed by the Basij Resistance Forces, a militia that assists the army in wartime.
``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous.
Khatami's government has tried to distance itself from offers by Iranian groups to pay money to anyone implementing the fatwa.
On Monday, a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward of dlrs 333,000.
The edict has strained ties between Iran and the West, especially Britain.
Britain restored diplomatic relations last month after Khatami's government distanced itself from the reward offering.
Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding after Khomeini issued the edict, expressed relief that the ordeal was over.
