Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will start his two-day official visit Tuesday to Italy in a bid improve the bilateral relations.
However, the Iranian foreign minister today declined to comment on whether the thorny issue of the Salman Rushdie affairs will be dealt with during his forthcoming trip to Italy.
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
Velayati said "the main purpose of this trip is to pay an official visit to Rome and talk to the high-ranking officials of that country about bilateral, regional and international cooperation between Iran and Italy."
An Iranian source from the Foreign Ministry said that Velayati will also call on Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
Ludovico Ortona, Italian Ambassador to Iran, has already left for Rome to make preparations for the high-level bilateral talks.
The source said that Iran-Italian economic relations will be on the top of agenda between Velayati and his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini.
Italy and Iran signed an agreement in November for several industrial projects totalling 561 million U.S. dollars, which will be financed by the Italian Bank Medtocredito along with a number of other banks from England, France, Japan, Netherlands and Germany.
