Controversial British author Salman Rushdie says he has been hurt and humiliated by the country of his birth, India, which treated him as a persona non grata and his next novel is about saying good-bye to the country, Press Trust of India reported Saturday.
"The biggest loss to me is that my relationship with India has been thoroughly damaged.
India prevented me from going to India," Rushdie said in a recent interview published in the latest issue of Sunday, a weekly magazine.
Bocker prize winner Rushdie had been living a furtive life since 1989 under police protection in Britain following a death sentence issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for blaspheming Islam in his book the Satanic Verses.
Iran announced a lifting of the death sentence on September 24 this year.
"They (India) won't give me a visa, despite the fact that I have a right to go there, that I have a status of non-resident Indians by virtue of being born there, and despite the fact that I have my property there," Rushdie said.
