British Airways said Friday that it would not permit the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against Rushdie.
``While we have every sympathy with Rushdie's difficulties with overseas travel,'' said Bruce Tobin, a spokesman for the airline, ``our ultimate responsibility is the safety of our passengers and staff.''
Rushdie has made many overseas trips since 1989, when the death sentence, in the form of a religious edict, was issued against him.
But not once has he flown on British Airways.
``We maintain close contact with the relevant authorities in all matters that might affect the safety and security of our passengers,'' Tobin said.
``Mr. Rushdie is not a British Airways customer.''
