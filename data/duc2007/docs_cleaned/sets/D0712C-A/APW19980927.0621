British writer Salman Rushdie sees new safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether anything has really changed.
On Sunday, both newspapers and ordinary Iranians debated the announcement made in New York Thursday by Iran's foreign minister distancing his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic.
There is no room for optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
The Iran News, a moderate daily close to the foreign ministry, said there was nothing new in Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's statement that his ``government disassociates itself from any reward ... and does not support it.''
It pointed out that the government's position has for several years been not to seek Rushdie's death.
