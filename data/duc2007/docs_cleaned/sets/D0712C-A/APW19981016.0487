Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met Salman Rushdie for private discussions Friday.
The Foreign Office declined to say anything about the meeting, stressing that it was private.
Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed that the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' should be killed.
Last month, Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself from rewards offered for Rushdie's death.
However, on Monday a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward of dlrs 333,000.
