Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at presidential office said here today.
"The decree [death sentence] has not been cancelled.
No one, except for Ayatollah Khamenei, can revise the decree," the official at presidential office told Xinhua today.
The official at presidential office who spoke on condition of anonymity said that since the decree was issued by a religious scholar of the high stature of Khomeini it could not be changed by officials.
"Only Ayatollah Khamenei, as the Supreme Jurisprudent, can revise decrees issued by the late Imam," he stressed.
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses", and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
However, Iranian authorities have given into tremendous pressures from the European Union after the death of Khomeini, promising not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill Rushdie.
Similar assurances have been given to European Union by President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue of Islamic law and that "it was not essentially an Executive issue."
The official at presidential office said that Rafsanjani wanted to draw the attention to the religious importance of the decree.
"The president wanted to make a distinction between a religious, jurisprudential decree and an executive, administrative one," the official said.
"The British with their hue and cry wanted to make it sound that the decree was an executive one," he added.
"In fact it was the British themselves who did not want to have this issue resolved and even now their actions show they do not seek an end to it," he said.
Rafsanjani's Monday statement on Rushdie has drawn criticism from a national newspaper Jomhuri Eslami.
The paper issued an editorial Tuesday, saying that Rushdie still has to face death sentence because "no one has the right to change the divine command."
"It is the responsibility of all Moslems to kill anyone who would insult the Blessed Progeny of Prophet Muhammad, the Holy Koran and Islamic sanctities," the daily said.
"This punishment has to be done regardless of time, place and individuals involved.
The decree is not a governmental or personal decree and hence cannot be changed to adjust to new political conditions," it warned.
Observers here said that the indirect talks on Salman Rushdie between EU and Tehran is producing some understanding.
The two sides have agreed the case be regarded merely as a religious and theoretical issue.
They said that with U.S. pressures mounting on Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to gain the cooperation of the European Union.
"The question is not whether, but how, to withdraw from previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home and abroad," a political analyst here said.
Iranian authorities also face tremendous pressure and opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the issue of Rushdie.
Iranian officials have stated recently that they want to adopt a protective stance with regard to issues such as Rushdie affair.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie affairs.
