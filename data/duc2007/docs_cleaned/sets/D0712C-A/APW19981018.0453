Residents of a village in northern Iran have offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
The people of Kiapey will give 10 carpets, 4,500 sq.
The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker Prize-winning author.
The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, condemned Rushdie to death in 1989, ruling that his book, ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
The villagers have also invited the parents of Mustapha Mazeh, who blew himself up while working on a home-made bomb in a London hotel in 1989, to live in Kiapey, which has a population of 2,000 and is near Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province.
Iranians believe Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, intended to kill Rushdie, but British police have dismissed this theory.
Last week, a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
And hard-liners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of the death sentence.
The government said last month it did not support the bounty and, after a meeting between their foreign ministers in New York on Sept. 24, Britain and Iran decided to upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level.
