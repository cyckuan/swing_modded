The European Union on Monday welcomed a move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
In a statement issued here, the EU said the Iranian decision opens the way for closer cooperation between Europe and the Tehran government.
The statement was issued here because Austria holds the rotating EU presidency.
The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties with the European Union.
Britain also has sought better ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran, which have gone to France and other European countries.
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
He did not, however, say that the government was rescinding the edict.
Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989, claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
