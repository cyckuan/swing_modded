The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said.
"They've got the fuselage and John Kennedy's in it," said a government source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.
There was no immediate information about the bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on board the plane when it crashed on July 16.
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee, who was overseeing the search, canceled a round of morning TV appearances and went to the USS Grasp, the ship where the wreckage was to be deposited after being raised from the ocean floor.
The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration spent Tuesday night scouring a site 11 kilometers southwest of the Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated was the likely splash point for the plane.
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34.
Kennedy, the pilot, planned to drop off his sister-in-law on the island and continue to his cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port.
