Between a beach he loved and the site where his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
In a private, closely guarded ceremony aboard a US Navy destroyer, the remains of Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, her 34-year-old sister, were laid in the choppy Atlantic Ocean.
The ceremony occurred in view of the shorefront estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and near where his small plane plunged into the sea last Friday night.
Invoking the mercies of God, a Roman Catholic priest and two Navy chaplains presided over a brief, solemn ceremony on the deck of the USS Briscoe.
Meanwhile, three miles away, the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship continued retrieving the wreckage of Kennedy's shattered aircraft.
One to three members at a time, the grieving family members cast the ashes to the ocean.
Navy brass quintet played, but the familiar strains of Taps was not heard at this non-military ceremony rarely allowed on a Navy ship for a civilian.
All along the shoreline of southwestern Martha's Vineyard, vacationers and Vineyarders, gripped for days by news of Kennedy's disappearance and the grim discovery of his remains, watched with the drama from afar.
No family deserves this.''
The service, which concluded nearly a week of intense emotions after JFK Jr.'s plane was reported missing last Friday, began at 9:30 a.m. as the funeral party, led by Kennedy's uncle, US Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, left the family compound at Hyannis Port for Woods Hole.
There, the Briscoe, a guided-missile destroyer transported them to the burial site.
The warship moved at a processional pace past the jagged Gay Head cliffs and the beaches where bits of Kennedy's airplane were found.
The service, which began shortly before noon, was witnessed by about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters' mother, stepfather and sister.
The party listened as the clergymen conducted the moving ritual of committing human remains to the sea.
Kennedy's sister and uncle spoke at the somber service, which fulfilled John Kennedy Jr.'s wishes to be buried at sea and away from the public spotlight.
Shielded by Coast Guard vessels, the crew of the Briscoe ensured that privacy in a strictly enforced security zone that kept the news media, in chartered boats and TV helicopters, far away.
Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the use of the Briscoe, which was diverted from maneuvers in the North Atlantic to become the platform for a nationally riveting funeral.
The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and their ashes scattered less than 24 hours after Navy divers lifted the bodies feet from the ocean floor.
Despite the rapid turn of events, hundreds of mourners and the curious lined the southwest shoreline of Martha's Vineyard from Gay Head to the wild beaches along Moshup Trail, near the estate that Kennedy and his sister had inherited from their mother.
Cami Stephens of Hyannis, watching the Briscoe return to Woods Hole, said she wanted to bid farewell to Kennedy, someone she knew and admired.
``He was down-to-earth someone who'd get coffee up the street, someone who'd say `Hi,' '' explained Stephens, who said she has been part of many get-togethers at the compound in Hyannis Port.
Kennedy and his family ``would make you feel like you were someone,'' she said.
``This, to me, it's like a nightmare.''
The mourners arrived in Woods Hole about 9:30 a.m. and were quickly transported to the Briscoe by the Coast Guard vessel Sanibel.
Close to 10 a.m., the Briscoe pulled up anchor and began its journey around Gay Head in choppy seas.
At 11:20 a.m., four miles off the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard, the ship stopped.
The crew then completed preparations for a ceremony that lasted roughly 30 minutes.
The service was attended by dozens of Briscoe crew members outfitted in dress-white uniforms.
After the service, the mourners returned to Woods Hole at 3:30 p.m. Sen. Kennedy and the funeral party then proceeded to Hyannis Port for a private reception.
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck.
Kennedy, a fledgling pilot, was at the controls of a newly-purchased, high-performance airplane from Fairfield, N.J. to Martha's Vineyard last Friday just after sunset, en route to a cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight and less than 20 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport Kennedy's plane vanished from air-traffic control radar screens.
Though the exact cause of the crash is not yet known, authorities believe Kennedy lost control of the single-engine airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the murky night sky.
The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision, aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to the crash.
After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras, Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have been sheared away.
By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette.
At 7:15 p.m. that night, the remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne, where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard J. Evans and Dr. James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims' families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies, fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid press or on the Internet.
President and Hillary Clinton plan to attend.
