When John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife died, many people wondered what had happened to the couple's dog, Friday, who was frequently seen around the city with them.
The Daily News first reported on Thursday that the dog was alive and living in Massachusetts with the couple's relatives.
It was not immediately known if the Kennedys' cat was also in Massachusetts.
