The plane was small but powerful, the conditions tough for navigation.
The disappearance of Kennedy's plane has raised familiar questions about the rules regarding flights, the safety of flying small aircraft, and the weather conditions that might have made Kennedy's flight especially difficult.
Here are some of the issues that may have come in to play when Kennedy's six-seater plane took off from New Jersey: Q.
What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m. Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38 p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard.
What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
According to the National Weather Service, visibility at Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at about the time Kennedy took off.
Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you.
If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which Kennedy did not have.
Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all times?
The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m.
Lights are turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can turn them on by radio.
The airport operates 24 hours a day.
Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
Probably not.
Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan for his trip to Martha's Vineyard.
If a plane has not filed a flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any deviation would not cause alarm.
It is unclear whether Kennedy communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard.
Airport officials Saturday declined to comment.
What kind of flight certification did John F. Kennedy, Jr. have?
Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182.
In April, he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
What are the requirements for flight certification?
To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner.
Most students log 60 or 70 hours before seeking certification.
To fly a plane with complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor.
It is not known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or after buying a more powerful plane.
Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was flying, and what is its safety record?
The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are topped off.
Manufactured by The New Piper Aircraft Inc. of Vero Beach, Fla., it is described in company literature as the ``SUV of single-engine planes.''
More than 7,500 are in use worldwide, flying 500,000 hours annually.
The plane is equipped with an Emergency Locating Transmitter, which can be triggered manually by the pilot, or is automatically activated by impact with the ground or water.
The transmitter emits a radio signal but does not work underwater.
There is no flight data recorder as with large commercial jets.
Since 1996, the Saratoga has been involved in 118 accidents or incidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, and 26 crashes in which a fatality occured.
