small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
Officials said the debris included part of the plane's landing gear and a prescription bottle with Carolyn Kennedy's name on it.
Also recovered was a black suitcase with a business card bearing the name of Lauren G. Bessette, 34, an investment banker for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Kennedy's sister-in-law.
The suitcase and other debris were found on a beach about two miles from the Martha's Vineyard estate once owned by Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass.
Ms. Kennedy was to be married yesterday before 275 guests.
The wedding was postponed indefinitely.
Coast Guard cutters and an Air National Guard helicopter equipped with an infrared scanning device continued through the night to search for any survivors from the single-engine plane the Kennedys were in.
``We're not ready to give up on this yet,'' said Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
The plane, a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on Friday and was scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard about 10 p.m.
The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family notified the FAA.
At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Saturday, a white tent stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
Mass was said on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying ``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president.
He was born on Nov. 25, 1960, weeks after his father's election, and was known to the nation as ``John-John.''
After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington.
It was his third birthday.
Given his celebrity and pedigree, word of Kennedy's disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the corridors of the White House to the major networks, which broke into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, was told about the plane's disappearance shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday, the White House said.
The president called several members of the Kennedy family, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
The cause of the plane's disappearance remained a mystery Saturday.
Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air controllers during the flight, officials said.
For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod.
About 3:30 a.m. Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the Kennedy airplane.
Later Saturday morning, two boaters found some debris floating off the Connecticut coast.
That, too, was a false alert.
Other agencies joined the search.
The Air National Guard dispatched a C-130 cargo plane.
Fifteen planes from the Civil Air Patrol were searching, too.
New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment to make sure he was not there.
The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early Saturday afternoon.
That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard.
Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday.
The man, a lawyer whom Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low, perhaps 40 feet over the water.
On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope.
But as the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors were fading with each passing hour.
Navy salvage experts were consulted.
An oceanographic survey ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in the search area.
Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken airplanes.
Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an investigation of the plane's disappearance.
The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's Vineyard.
Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years, said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m. Friday as they walked toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight checks.
One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking area, he said.
But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking space.
``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with the plane,'' Bailey said.
``It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this here?'''
He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard.
Bailey, who flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be hazardous, especially at night.
Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use to piece together the details of jet crashes.
The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide the plane.
Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in the area was poor, pilots said.
``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard to see the horizon,'' said Michael C. Bard, a private pilot, who left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to his home in Danbury, Conn. ``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult maintaining the airplane in an upright condition,'' he said.
Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.
While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age personally and professionally in New York City.
He grew up with his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.
After graduating from New York University Law School in 1989, he went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
Through it all, Kennedy was the constant object of media attention.
He was crowned ``The Sexiest Man Alive,'' and ``America's Most Eligible Bachelor.''
The rise and fall of his romance with the actress Daryl Hannah spilled across the front pages of the tabloids.
When he twice failed his bar examination, that, too, was front-page news.
It seemed a minor miracle, then, that Kennedy managed to marry Ms. Bessette in 1996 in near secrecy on a secluded island off Georgia.
Ms. Bessette Kennedy, who had worked in public relations for Calvin Klein, was immediately anointed a ``symbol of American style,'' by Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar.
There seemed no limit to the public appetite for gossip about the couple.
Even a quarrel with his wife videotaped by a stranger was broadcast on television.
In recent years, Kennedy seemed to have settled into his work as editor of George, a flashy monthly magazine about politics that he started in 1995.
Ms. Bessette Kennedy, 33, is a year younger than her sister, Lauren Bessette, who is a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
She has an identical twin, Lisa.
Their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator, and their stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, live in Connecticut.
Their father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, did not return a telephone call.
In Hyannis Port, a Kennedy wedding became a vigil.
Christina Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal party before attending the wedding as a guest.
``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,'' Ms. Rivers said.
``It's just not fair.''
