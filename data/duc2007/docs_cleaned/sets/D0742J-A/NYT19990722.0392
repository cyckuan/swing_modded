John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said Thursday.
Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation continues.
One source close to the probe said that all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up, including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it hit the water.
All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Richard J. Evans.
After an examination that occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries.''
But investigators would not comment further on the condition of the bodies or the details of coroner's report.
And they would not say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July 16.
The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in forensic pathology said Thursday.
The cause of death is generally known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the cause of the wreck.
Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed especially quickly, pathologists said.
The remains were taken to a Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical examiner's office and the Cape Islands District Attorney's office.
Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, Ill.
The haste in this case, he said, could lead to questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so are the risks of carelessness.
He pointed to other ``autopsies associated with the Kennedy family'' the botched investigation that followed President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago, in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as Chappaquiddick.
``You can't let .
.those kinds of pressures alter your routines,'' he said.
``If you alter your procedure and do things differently, then you're always going to run into problems.''
Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the death.
In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign of what the pilot was doing.
Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said.
After every plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to collect a series of specimens.
Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine the victims' injuries.
Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a victim's family sues for damages related to the crash.
The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he said.
Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case the local district attorney and the state coroner indicate an unusual intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the burial.
Officials were especially reluctant to give out information on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical and reasonable, Kirschner said.
``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he said.
``Because when you're too deferential, you're not thinking of the things you should be thinking of.''
