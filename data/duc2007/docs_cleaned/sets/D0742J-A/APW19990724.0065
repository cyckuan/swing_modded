The U.S. Coast Guard incurred costs totaling $287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday.
The search and rescue effort began early Saturday morning and ended when it became clear that Kennedy's plane had crashed into the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
That initial search involved patrol boats, helicopters and other aircraft stationed along the East Coast, including bases in Cape Cod, Mass.
Montauk, N.Y; Newport, R.I.; and Woods Hole, Mass., according to Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski.
The costs include fuel, maintenance and salaries and were covered by the Coast Guard's annual congressional appropriation for operating expenses, Lapinski said.
