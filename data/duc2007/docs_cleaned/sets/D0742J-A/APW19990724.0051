Two flatbed trucks under police escort transported wreckage from the John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash to the Coast Guard hangar where it will be examined in detail by federal investigators.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga, described as ``twisted metal,'' arrived late Friday night, a Coast Guard official said.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, hopes to learn what happened July 16 that caused the plane to dive into the sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
However authorities have acknowledged they may never find the reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law.
Reports have emerged that there was no mechanical failure in the engine or with the craft's propellers.
Ordinarily, only one regional investigator would be assigned to examine the cause of a small plane crash, NTSB spokesman Paul Schlamm told the Boston Herald.
In the Kennedy crash, a team of eight or nine people will investigate, Schlamm said, including specialists such as metallurgists, meteorologists and structures experts.
``Was it an impact break?
Was there a crack?
Was there something pre-existing?''
Schlamm said.
Officials are also examining radar data from five states to create a more accurate picture of the plane's path before it crashed about 7 miles off the coast of Aquinnah.
They will analyze the plane's history and maintenance records as well as Kennedy's pilot experience for more clues to the flight's final records.
No more of the plane's debris is expected to be recovered, Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Victor Beck said.
About 90 percent of the wreckage has been removed from the ocean floor, he said.
``Everything's aboard that's coming aboard,'' Beck said.
``The Navy's work here is done.''
