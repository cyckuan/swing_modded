The U.S. Coast Guard and the Air National Guard are conducting a massive search off the coast of Long Island, N.Y. for a small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the 35th U.S. President, U.S. media reported Saturday.
The search began Saturday morning in an area covering some 1,000 square miles, presumably the flight path of Kennedy's plane, searchers said.
The plane carrying also Kennedy's wife and his sister-in-law reportedly took off from Caldwell, N.J. at 8:40 pm Friday and was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, Mass.. a little more than one hour later, but it did not.
The first report about the missing of the single-engine plane came from members of Kennedy family, airport sources said.
John F.Kennedy Jr., 38 and living in New York, is the founder of George magazine.
Before going to publishing, he was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan of New York.
