John F. Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga II HP out of such a freefall.
``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
``The normal rate of descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per minute for passenger comfort.''
Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators, but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the plane's rapid descent as being out of control.
Searchers recovered other small pieces of debris from the crash, but failed to pinpoint the plane's underwater location.
Although investigators believe they have several promising sites within the 24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable to find the main portion of the wreckage.
Police divers will be joined this morning by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage and recovery vessel based in Little Creek, Va.
The Grasp, with a crew of 100 including 22 Navy divers arrived at the scene Monday afternoon, but dive preparations were not concluded in time to send divers into the 68-degree waters.
Those divers are expected to search the area this morning, weather permitting.
Capt.
Jack Gallant, a public information officer with the Navy, said the divers would make tethered dives, meaning they would not be as limited in time and depth as divers with oxygen tanks might be.
Should the wreckage be located, Gallant said, the Grasp would be able to bring it to the surface, using a 40-foot crane with a 200-foot depth capacity.
Ocean depths in the search area are generally between 60 and 80 feet.
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said that, while Monday had been primarily ``a day of preparation,'' today's operations would be ``extensive.''
Several other ships from the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will join in the operation.
Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a reported $300,000 only three months ago.
Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours since its manufacture.
Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11, topping off the tank with 62 gallons.
Pearce said there were no indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling and Friday's fatal crash.
Pearce also noted that the plane's magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m. EDT, investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy may have had.
Pearce said the recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB, said Monday that, when operating, the system is automatically activated every time the microphone key is depressed.
In the meantime, as the reality of the tragedy of the three deaths finally became obvious Monday, the families of the victims briefly broke their silence.
After Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., traveled to Bridgehampton, N.Y., to meet with and console John Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the Kennedy family released a statement.
``We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss of John and Carolyn and of Lauren Bessette.
John was a shining light in all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a little boy.''
And in Connecticut, another grieving family came to grips with the loss of two of its members.
``Each of these three young people ... was the embodiment of love, accomplishment and passion for life,'' said a statement from Carolyn and Lauren Bessette's parents.
``John and Carolyn were true soul mates, and we hope to honor them in death in the simple manner in which they chose to live their lives.''
The statement was read in the Bessette family hometown of Greenwich, Conn., by family friend Grant Stinchfield.
Condolences also poured in from other quarters, with both President Clinton and GOP presidential hopeful Gov.
