Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998, according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who did not have a more precise date Saturday.
Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997.
He apparently did not have an instrument rating, meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said, because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed.
Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April.
The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year, said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport.
About 350 planes are registered there, he said.
The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another woman was wearing a beige dress, he said.
(Other reports said that Ms. Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them.)
Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot.''
He had what appeared from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other pilot said.
The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals.
It was not clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have affected his ability to control the plane.
The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their mutual instructor.
``He always said he had an instructor fly with him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot.
``He may have been getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his skills, even though he had the license.''
Aviation experts said he might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good time'' flying with Kennedy.
An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under no obligation to check in.
Private planes commonly do not fly under air traffic control.
The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity and altitude.
But for private flights like this one, the transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity.
Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
The Saratoga can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front, each of whom has flight controls.
The plane has a single, 300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine in a large car.
It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people, baggage and fuel.
It carries about 100 gallons of fuel.
List price on new Saratogas is $419,000 for the base model, with various options available.
Small private airplanes typically do not carry cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders, but accident investigators can usually determine from the wreckage such questions as whether the propeller was intact and rotating at impact, and whether the plane broke up in flight.
Radar can also give useful information, including the path of the descent.
