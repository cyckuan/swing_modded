Members of the Kennedy family gathered at their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law.
The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who like his brother the president was assassinated in the 1960s.
The wedding was postponed.
The mood inside the Kennedy compound here was somber but hopeful, said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman.
He said three Catholic priests were present and that a mass was held for family members Saturday morning on the porch of the home of Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's widow.
Guards and barricades kept hordes of tourists and reporters about a block away from the white houses topped with weathered gray shingles that have served as a resort and a refuge for the extended Kennedy family for more than half a century.
Inside the compound, an American flag flew at full mast as an expression of hope.
The compound had served as a family's and a nation's focal point for tragedy in the past, and fears grew that yet more sadness awaited the country's most prominent political clan.
As darkness moved over the relatively calm waters west and south of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard kept up what it insisted was a search for survivors from John Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga airplane.
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said his service and the Federal Aviation Administration began searching for the aircraft shortly after midnight when members of the Kennedy family said the plane had not arrived at an expected landing on Martha's Vineyard Friday night.
However, actual visual search of the area could not begin until shortly after daylight Saturday and did not focus on the waters near Martha's Vineyard until after the luggage and debris conformed to be from the plane were spotted.
``We have a debris field that really is the center of our search, but we're searching an area probably from Woods Hole (on the coast of the Massachusetts mainland) south about 10 to 15 miles south of Martha's Vineyard,'' Larrabee told a news conference in Boston.
Larrabee said a National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration research vessel equipped with sonar was to arrive in the search area early Saturday night and begin scanning the ocean floor for the missing aircraft.
Kennedy, who recently obtained his private pilot's license, was flying under conditions that other pilots said could be treacherous haze that made it hard to distinguish land from water.
Kennedy was not trained in instrument-assisted flying procedures and would have been forced to rely on his visual perception of the terrain as he approached Martha's Vineyard in the 300-horsepower, six-passenger aircraft.
The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30 p.m. EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30, according to the Coast Guard.
Kennedy had not filed a flight plan, and none was expected for that kind of trip, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Larrabee said FAA records indicated radar had tracked Kennedy's plane as far as Martha's Vineyard.
He reportedly had planned to drop off Miss Bessette at Martha's Vineyard before proceeding on with his wife to Hyannis Port.
Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr. had been in the nation's limelight for most of his life.
He became an enduring symbol of national grief when, as a 3-year-old toddler known as ``John-John,'' he was caught by television cameras saluting the flag-draped coffin of his father, the slain president.
When he failed the New York bar examination, dated movie stars, worked in a New York district attorney's office and got married, it was always in front of the news media.
In 1988, People Magazine proclaimed him the ``sexiest man alive.''
Only his Sept. 21, 1996 wedding, in the seclusion of Georgia's Cumberland Island, was private.
Although often mentioned as a potential political candidate who might carry on the legacy of his father and uncles, Robert and Edward, he chose journalism instead and founded George magazine, which blended politics and celebrity.
President Clinton was receiving reports on the search at his weekend retreat at Camp David, according to the White House press office.
``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on board,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
