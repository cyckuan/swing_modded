Kennedy family and friends paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr, son of the former U.S. president, his wife and her sister in a private memorial service in a New York church.
Some 350 people attended the memorial service including U.S. President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea.
The service was held well out of the gaze of the public, which has followed every detail since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane crash a week ago.
Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and her sister, 34, were killed when the small private plane Kennedy was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off the Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States on July 16.
The bodies were recovered Wednesday, and the ashes of the three were committed to the sea, near the spot where they died, in a simple and private ceremony on a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday.
