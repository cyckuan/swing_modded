a tribute to founder John F. Kennedy Jr. -- is without a celebrity cover for the first time.
The October issue, which comes two months after Kennedy's death, has a blurry image of the American flag.
The issue contains several interviews Kennedy did, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrahkan, Fidel Castro and President Clinton.
The magazine quotes Kennedy as saying: ``In the most challenging of times, men and women of courage and conviction make a difference.''
Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane he was piloting crashed off the shore of Martha's Vineyard.
