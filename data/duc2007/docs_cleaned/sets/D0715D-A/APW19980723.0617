Namibia has become the 24th country to ratify the Ottawa Convention banning land mines.
The ban on use, production and stockpiling of the anti-personnel weapon has been signed by 127 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 40 countries to become official.
The National Assembly ratified the treaty on Wednesday.
The treaty also requires member states to destroy existing mines.
Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said Namibia, located on Africa's southwest Atlantic coast, would keep a small number of mines for training in destruction and research.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its former leader Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for their work in bringing world attention to the issue.
