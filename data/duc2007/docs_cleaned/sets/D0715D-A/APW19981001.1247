Nobel Peace Prize winner, a queen, a billionaire financier, a foreign minister and the U.N. deputy secretary-general joined forces Thursday to fight the next battles in the campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines.
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
And they launched a new fund, which already has contributions and pledges of over dlrs 1.3 million.
``We have never thought that the treaty itself was victory,'' said Jody Williams, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her six year crusade with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa in December.
The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for action on a range of international humanitarian issues including curbing small arms.
The news conference in the U.N. Trusteeship Chamber launching the land mine campaign's next battlegrounds reflected the new alliance: Williams was flanked by Axworthy, Queen Noor of Jordan, billionaire financier George Soros, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette and Norway's U.N.
Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby.
The queen recalled that she and her husband, King Hussein, were driving in Minnesota, where he is receiving cancer treatment, when they received a call on Sept. 16 that Burkina Faso had become the 40th nation to ratify the land mine treaty which meant it would go into effect in March 1999.
``There was a huge `whoopie' that emanated from this car ... throughout the Minnesota countryside that I know was just a faint echo of jubilation that would have been spreading around the world at that time,'' she said.
Since mid-September, five more nations have ratified the treaty, most recently Japan.
Axworthy said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was ``so enthusiastic'' that he woke him at 6 a.m. to tell him about the ratification.
``It just continues to demonstrate the momentum in the world to make this thing real,'' Williams said.
Noor said it was encouraging that major producers and exporters including France, Germany, Britain and Hungary had already ratified the treaty.
But the United States has refused to sign the convention, maintaining that land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
Russia and China are also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
While the United States has pledged money for demining efforts and assisting victims, Soros said to enthusiastic applause: ``I think the greatest contribution they could make actually is signing the treaty.''
President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative weapon by then.
Williams, an American, urged governments and private institutions to contribute to a fund set up with the dlrs 500,000 which the International Campaign received as co-winner of the Nobel prize to continue the campaign's activities ``until we truly eradicate this weapon and aid all the victims.''
Soros pledged dlrs 300,000 and urged the private sector to contribute.
``This has to be a long-range commitment.
While we are celebrating, land mines are being used in Kosovo, for instance.''
Axworthy announced a 300,000 Canadian dollar contribution (U.S. dlrs 196,000).
Kolby announced a Norwegian contribution of dlrs 200,000.
And Williams said Ireland last week donated dlrs 150,000.
