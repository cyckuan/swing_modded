It has been two years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly negotiated in Oslo.
Many say her efforts to draw attention to the fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her greatest legacies.
But what kind of legacy is it?
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of civil war in Kosovo.
So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were fighting.
Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan (and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
Among those were three that signed the treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United States, Russia and China, mostof the nations in the Middle East and many in Asia.
``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the coordinator of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to write off the treaty as a failure.
On the contrary, they point to progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide production of mines and their availability in the international arms market, according to arms control monitors.
Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the treaty was written two years ago.
Even countries that have so far refused to sign the treaty including the United States and Russia have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain kinds altogether.
Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public perception.
Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans, of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a minefield in Angola.
``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one thought about it,'' Ms. Fowler said.
``Everybody is aware that mines were used in Kosovo.
The treaty is setting a new international standard.''
Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the eradication of mines another.
Mines are cheap and durable and deadly.
In Yugoslavia, which has not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav fire.
Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked Albanian homes to keeP refugees from returning home.
(Many returned anyway, and died as a result.)
Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty itself.
The treaty the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction went into effect March 1, 1999, six months after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
There is no governing organization to oversee it and no mechanism to punish those who violate it.
It essentially relies on member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy them.
Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force nations to comply.
``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in.''
There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States won't sign it.
Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's restrictions.
They insist they need the most common type of land mines those left buried in the ground to protect South Korea from North Korea.
They also want to keep using ``smart'' anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough to trigger them.
The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a process critics say has moved slowly.
Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land mines?'''
