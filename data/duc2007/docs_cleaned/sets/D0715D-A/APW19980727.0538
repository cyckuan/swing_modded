Spain began destroying its stockpile of over 800,000 anti-personal landmines Monday, in compliance with last December's Ottawa treaty.
The first three mines were symbolically incinerated at an explosives factory near this western Spanish city by Defense Minister Eduardo Serra, ministry spokesman Antonio Castro said.
About 1,000 mines are due to pass through the factory's incinerators every day for over two years at a total cost of over 500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.3 million).
An international draft treaty banning the production, export and use of landmines was signed by 121 nations in Ottawa, Canada last December.
The treaty allowed four years for the destruction of all stockpiled land mines, and 10 years for the deactivation of minefields.
Serra told reporters that Spain was at ``the vanguard'' of landmine destruction.
The ministry is destroying Spanish landmines, leaving a question mark over what will happen to mines belonging to United States military bases in Spanish territory, Castro said.
The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their borders.
An estimated 100 million antipersonnel mines are deployed in about 60 countries worldwide, often killing or crippling people decades after a conflict has ended.
