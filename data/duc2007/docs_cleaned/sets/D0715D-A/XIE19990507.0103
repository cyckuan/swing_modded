Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister, Toko Serrao said here Thursday that Angola, which is still locked in a civil war, will continue to use anti-personnel land mines.
Serrao made the remarks at the on-going meeting of the signatory states of the convention on the prohibition of the use, storage, production and transference of anti-personnel land mines being held in Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
Serrao is the first Angolan senior official to make a speech at the meeting which started on May 3.
Angolan government has been criticized these days for not observing the land mine prohibition convention, which the Angolan government signed on December 4, 1997.
An investigator with an international mines prohibition campaign even said new land mine zones had cropped up in eastern Angola's Luena district, and that the local government prevented any move of clearing land mines in the area.
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries.
It is said that one out of 415 Angolans has been a victim of land mine in this southern African country with a population of 12 million.
Angola, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia are the four countries which suffer most from land mines in the southern African region.
About 250,000 people were killed by land mines and another 500,000 injured by them in this region in the past 20 years.
The land mine prohibition meeting, which has attracted about 1,000 representatives from 72 countries and organizations including the United Nations, will come to a close Friday.
