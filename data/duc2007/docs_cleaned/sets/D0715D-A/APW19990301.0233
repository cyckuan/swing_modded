An international treaty to ban land mines that kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace.
The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133 countries and ratified by 65 of them.
About 12 countries have destroyed their entire stocks of land mines.
And even with the treaty, it will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines scattered in more than 60 countries.
``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not just in law but also in implementation,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony in Geneva.
``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle but in practice,'' he said.
Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today.
The treaty, agreed to after a campaign by charities working with victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, stocks and exports of land mines.
Seats for the U.S. delegation were conspicuously empty at the start of a ceremony marking the land mines accord at U.N. headquarters in Geneva.
The sounds of a ``peace bell'' and a children's choir floated through U.N. offices in Vienna, Austria, to mark the accord coming into force.
The cause also was supported by Princess Diana.
Diana drew attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk through a minefield in Angola in February 1997.
She died in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31 of that year.
