among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain, anti-mine campaigners said Thursday.
Angola continues to use the weapons although it has signed the treaty, while Burundi and Sudan ''likely'' do so, according to the Landmine Monitor 2000 report.
Sudan has denied the allegation.
The study said Yugoslav forces laid some 50,000 land mines during the Kosovo conflict and that Chechnya also saw heavy laying of mines.
The report, produced by the Nobel laureate International Campaign to Ban Landmines, will be presented next week to a Geneva meeting of countries that have ratified a 1997 treaty outlawing the weapons.
''We have turned the tide in the battle against mines,'' the 1,121-page report said.
It found that trade in the weapons has almost completely halted, with no shipments recorded this year or last.
Since the treaty came into force on March 1 last year, some 10 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed, bringing the total so far to 22 million, it said.
The study estimated that more than 250 million mines remain stockpiled in 105 nations.
China leads the list with some 110 million mines, followed by Russia with 60-70 million, Belarus with 10-15 million and the United States with 11 million, it said.
Ukraine, Pakistan and India each were estimated to have stocks of more than 4 million mines.
Estimates of deaths and injuries were ''sketchy and incomplete,'' the study conceded.
But it found marked decreases in countries including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Mozambique.
Still, new land mine victims have been recorded in 71 countries, more than half of them at peace, it said.
In Kosovo, 492 deaths and injuries were recorded in the year to May; in Chechnya, ''hundreds'' were suspected.
Since the treaty came into effect the weapons likely have been used in 20 conflicts, by 11 governments and 30 rebel groups.
The treaty has been signed by 138 governments and ratified by 101.
Among those who have not signed are the United States, Russia and China.
Washington maintains land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
President Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative.
Russia and China say they need land mines for defensive purposes.
Antipersonnel mines have been used in eight conflicts in Africa over the past year, more than any other continent, Landmine Monitor said.
They killed or maimed more than 1,000 people in Angola.
The report said Colombia, where the two biggest rebel factions have used land mines, is the only country in the Americas where they are now being used.
