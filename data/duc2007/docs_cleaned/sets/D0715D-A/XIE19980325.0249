The South African Campaign Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
The call coincides with Clinton's 11-day tour of six African countries, namely Ghana, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Botswana and Rwanda.
In a statement issued here Wednesday, the group said it is ironic the American leader is visiting Africa to discuss economic recovery support.
But it said one of the most critical impending recovery on the continent is the millions of hectares of land that cannot be developed as a result of millions of explosive devices.
The group said Africa is a continent solidly behind a treaty prohibiting production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.
But the U.S. government refuses to approve it.
However, the anti-landmine campaign said all the countries Clinton is touring have played major roles in global efforts to create a mine-free world.
The South African lobby group said while Clinton travels through Africa, it is collecting signatures protesting against U.S. policy on the explosive devices.
South Africa, a former producer,destroyed more than three million of its anti-personnel landmine stockpiles before it signed the international convention last year.
