Military representatives of 33 countries as well as non-governmental organizations opened a four-day conference Tuesday aimed eliminating land mines throughout Europe.
The conference, organized by the Austrian defense ministry, the Italian armed forces and the West European Union, is to improve cooperation in mine detection and destruction.
``The seminar is a sign of a new era in cooperation in the fields of disarmament and humanitarian assistance,'' Austrian Gen. Karl Majecen told the conference during opening ceremonies.
Austrian mine clearing experts are working with their counterparts from other countries in detecting and destroying landmines in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel.
The conference is expected to include discussions on ways to compile information and databanks on non-standard landmines, making them easier to disarm safely.
Majecen said it was time for European countries to coordinate their activities and share information in landmine technology and ways to detect and disarm them During his speech, Italian Defense Minister Massimo Brutti praised efforts by Europe and international organizations to remove ``these instruments of death.''
Brutti said Italy had already taken steps to comply with the 1997 Ottawa Treaty which bans the production, storage and use of such weapons.
The United States refused to sign the treaty because it wants to maintain landmines in the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.
The Pentagon also wants to exempt anti-personnel mines designed to deter tampering with larger anti-tank mines not covered by the treaty.
Washington is also lobbying NATO countries to allow the stockpiling of anti-personnel mines until the year 2003.
Critics accuse the Americans of trying to undermine the treaty among their European allies.
