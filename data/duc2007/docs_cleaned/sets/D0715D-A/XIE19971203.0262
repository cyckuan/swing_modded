Ukraine will not be among the first batch to sign the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced today.
The spokesman did not rule out a possible signing in the future.
Under the pact, signatories will be required to destroy their reserves of land mines within four years.
The spokesman said Ukraine stopped manufacturing mines and had suspended mine exports since 1995.
