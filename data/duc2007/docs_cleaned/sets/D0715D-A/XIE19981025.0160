Thailand is poised to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 after the army submitted the letter of affirmation to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, The Nation reported Sunday.
After several months of vetting and delay, the Permanent Secretary's Office of Defense informed the Foreign Ministry, which is coordinating preparations for the ratification process of the treaty, that it is agreeable to the original text and the Thai translation.
The air force and navy have both submitted their letters of affirmation to the ministry.
The Interior Ministry and the National Security Council have yet to reply.
The treaty, which will become an international law in March next year, imposes a comprehensive ban on using, stockpiling, producing and transporting anti-personnel mines.
Thailand would need at least 800 million baht (21 million U.S. dollars) to clear mines and rehabilitate the victims of land mines.
