South Africa is to join more than 100 countries in Canada this week to sign a treaty banning the use or possession of anti-personnel mines.
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo is expected to sign the treaty on Wednesday in Ottawa, according to an official statement issued in Pretoria today.
Richard Sherman, spokesman for the South African campaign to ban landmines, said his organization welcomed his country's involvement in a treaty against the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines.
He said the organization also wanted to extend programs for mine clearance and victim assistance.
