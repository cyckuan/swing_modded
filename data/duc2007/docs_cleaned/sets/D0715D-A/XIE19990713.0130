The Mozambican Anti-landmine Campaign has called upon the parliaments of the Community of Portuguese-speaking States to approve the Ottawa Convention, which bans production, use and stock of lethal land mines, as soon as possible.
The anti-landmine group said in a statement carried by the Noticias newspaper that the use of lethal land mines is violation of basic human rights.
The statement urged the heads of parliament of Mozambique, Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe to rethink of the issue of land mines and to support the Ottawa Convention so as to make the whole world free from such mines by the year 2010.
The seven members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking States have signed and approved the anti-landmine convention, but more than 50 countries have not approved the treaty.
The statement expressed regret that the Angolan government and the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), against the convention, are still using lethal land mines, killing and maiming innocent people, and women and children in particular.
It called upon Portugal, the only member of the Community of Portuguese- speaking States which is able to produce lethal land mines, to stop the mine production and destroy the land mines in stock.
It further asked the Portuguese-speaking countries to exert influence upon the governments concerned in a bid to help the victims of land mines and accelerate the demining process around the world.
