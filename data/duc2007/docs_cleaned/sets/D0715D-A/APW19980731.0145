Britain's ban on land mines will become total with the elimination of an exemption for ``exceptional circumstances,'' the government said Friday.
On July 10, under pressure to show support for Princess Diana's final campaign against land mines before the anniversary of her death Aug. 31, the House of Commons rushed through a bill ratifying the international treaty banning their use.
But it will not come into effect for some months, until at least 40 of the more than 120 signatories have ratified it.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had imposed a moratorium on the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by British forces in May.
An exemption was allowed for the weapons' use in exceptional circumstances, such as to defend an occupied zone.
Defense Secretary George Robertson said Friday that a total ban was being implemented to send a ``clear signal'' to the rest of the world.
Robertson, speaking to BBC radio before making a formal announcement to Parliament, said a concerted effort must be made to get countries that have not signed the convention to do so.
Removing the exemption would reinforce Britain's position, he said.
``We will wipe that away now to make sure that a very clear signal goes out to the rest of the world,'' he told BBC.
``We must now go out there and use Britain's moral authority to make sure that our position becomes the international standard,'' he said.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but would not come into force for at least another nine months.
It has to be ratified by a minimum of 40 countries.
Half of Britain's one million landmines have already been destroyed.
