The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community (SADC) to join the mine ban treaty, report reached here said on Friday.
In a message to SADC acting Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy, the campaigners said they are concerned that SADC members Tanzania, Angola and Zambia have not ratified the treaty and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not even signed it.
Forty-five of the 53 nations in Africa have signed the treaty, which prohibits use, production, trade in or stockpiling of antipersonnel mines.
