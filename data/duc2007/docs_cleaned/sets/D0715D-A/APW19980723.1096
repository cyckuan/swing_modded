France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N. officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines.
French Ambassador Alain Dejammet and the deputy German representative, Gerhard Walter Henze, turned in the so-called instruments of ratification, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect.
So far 25 countries have ratified it.
``Nevertheless, the goal remains to ban anti-personnel mines at a global level,'' the German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel said in a statement.
In a related matter, Malaysia became the 150th country to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Eckhard said.
