Kenya will next year ratify the Ottawa Treaty banning the use of land mines, according to a senior Kenyan government official.
There is need for protection of human rights as provided for in the international humanitarian law, the Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted Attorney-General Amos Wako as saying.
Some 133 states have signed the treaty and Kenya was the 122nd country to sign in December 1997.
About 42 countries out of the 53 member states of the Organization of African Unity have endorsed the treaty.
