The First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP) to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (the "Ottawa Treaty") opened here Monday with over 1,000 participants from 72 countries and international organizations.
Opening the meeting here in Maputo, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said the meeting offered a good opportunity for mapping out strategies to eliminate anti-personnel land mines to rid peoples of the world of their danger.
He expressed the hope that all parties will coordinate and reach consensus at the meeting to achieve the goal of rooting out land mines in ten years time.
Surveys showed that a total of two million mines have been planted all over Mozambique during the country's civil war.
Therefore, said the president, it will take about 160 years to clear all the mines at the current rate of removing 11,000 mines per year.
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries, 74 of which have ratified it.
Its ambitious goal is to clear all the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million, before the year 2009.
Chissano called on joint efforts by all countries and the international community to implement the Treaty, which was effective in September, 1998.
The issue of anti-personnel mines has topped the political itinerary of southern Africa.
The 1997 Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in Malawi issued a declaration asking all SADC members to prohibit anti-personnel mines, treating it as a national policy.
The president revealed that a SADC de-mining committee has been set up to coordinate efforts in this regard.
He appealed to all signatories to the Treaty to ratify it as soon as possible, and those who have not signed the Treaty to do it.
Present at the opening were also Louise Frechette, assistant secretary- general of the United Nations, and Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary -general of the Organization of African Unity.
The meeting is scheduled to end on May 7.
