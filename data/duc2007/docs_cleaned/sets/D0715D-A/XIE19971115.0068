Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy today failed to take Lebanon into signing the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines during meetings with Lebanese leaders.
When meeting with Axworthy, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz said if Israel signs the treaty, it will become easier for Lebanon to sign it.
Lebanon is concerned about the issue, but it is impossible for Lebanon to sign it while Israel is outside it, he added.
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry expressed the same idea at the meeting.
Lebanon rejected the signing to the ban because the Islamic resistance in the south uses anti-personnel weapons in its fight against Israeli occupation.
Axworthy explained to reporters at a joint news conference with Boueiz that the aim of signing the treaty is to help the countries concerned remove the mines and provide victims with financial assistance.
Axworthy arrived in Beirut Thursday night on his ongoing tour of the region aimed at drumming up support for the treaty that prohibits the manufacture, trade and use of anti-personnel land mines.
In addition to talks with Lebanese leaders, including President Elias Hrawi, Axworthy went to the country's southern port city of Saida Friday afternoon to meet with a group of children victims of land mines.
Canada signed the treaty several months ago and destroyed its last land mine last week.
Canada hoped Lebanon can be among the first batch to sign.
The Mideast tour has taken the Canadian foreign minister to Egypt, Israel and Jordan, and will take him to Syria Friday night.
