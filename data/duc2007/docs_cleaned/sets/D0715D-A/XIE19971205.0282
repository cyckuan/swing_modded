The treaty-signing conference on a global ban on landmines concluded here today, with 121 countries put their signatures onto the document.
The treaty goes into effect six months after 40 countries ratify it.
Those who have signed then have four years to destroy their stockpiles of landmines and 10 years to clear minefields.
The signing here is "just a beginning", Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told the 500-plus delegates from government, non-government organizations and international agencies.
"We must act now and seize the moment," he said, waving a thick document titled An Agenda for Mine Action.
The document was a "framework of a blueprint" and it "sets out directions," he said.
The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines.
