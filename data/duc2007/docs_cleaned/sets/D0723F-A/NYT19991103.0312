The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions, a Washington advocacy group.
Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs. access to AIDS drugs began in 1997.
That's when South Africa passed legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms by granting small local companies permission to produce their own AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make cheaper generic versions.
However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual property rights.
But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., persuaded Republican leaders to accept an amendment to the trade bill that would allow those African countries to continue to produce their copycat AIDS drugs.
Feinstein said banning these generic AIDS drugs in Africa would have caused needless suffering and death in countries where AIDS is so widespread it is a public health emergency.
``If you don't have generic drugs, you effectively say that people in Africa are not going to get the treatment that can sustain life,'' Feinstein said in an interview.
Speaking on the Senate floor, Feinstein said about 34 million people in Africa about the size of the population of California are infected with HIV or AIDS.
About one-third, or 11.5 million these people, have died from the disease, she said.
She said those deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV and AIDS-related deaths worldwide.
``The impact of AIDS in Africa is huge,'' Feinstein said.
``It continues to be a major threat to the well being of the entire African continent.
It is clearly in the national interest to prevent the further spread of HIV\AIDS in Africa,'' she said.
