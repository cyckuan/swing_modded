Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming election as a result of Republicans scuttling her party's proposals to boost patients' rights.
And, she said, ``I think it will be part of the presidential campaign.''
Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular Democratic amendments that would have let women in health maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery for breast cancer.
Another Democratic initiative would have guaranteed patients insured access to emergency rooms.
Republicans are expected to approve their own narrower bill on Thursday on how to regulate managed care providers.
But aides to President Clinton have said they will recommend that he veto the GOP version.
Republicans say the Democratic proposals would lead to escalating medical costs, increased insurance premiums and more uninsured people.
Feinstein told reporters that the issue of reining in managed care organizations is especially important in California.
There, she said, doctors are filing for bankruptcy and hospitals are closing at alarming rates, but managed care providers continue to take in large profits.
``In California, there are real problems,'' she said.
On Wednesday Republicans offered their own managed care proposals, including one designed to help women who are recovering from breast cancer surgery.
Her plan is similar to the Democratic proposal, but Republicans said that measure was too vague.
Republicans also planned to offer their own measure regarding access to emergency rooms.
Feinstein predicted that Democrats will win at the polls next year by blaming Republicans, not only for rejecting Democratic patients' rights proposals, but also for killing legislation that would have regulated tobacco companies and tightened rules on gun purchases.
She accused the Republicans of having a ``pro-tobacco and anti-health care reform kind of vision'' and said, ``I think the dominant share of Americans are on the other side of these issues.''
She said gun control will loom large in the campaign because of evidence that juveniles are able to get firearms easily and bring them into schools.
There is a clear need, she said, for ``targeted, prudent regulation of firearms.''
Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for 2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the ticket.
But she said the speculation about her ``makes me uncomfortable,'' because ``it builds up an expectation.''
The probability is very strong that I will be a U.S.
