Sen. Dianne Feinstein detoured from the Democratic leadership Thursday, vowing to vote this fall for a Republican-led constitutional amendment that would empower Congress to ban flag desecration.
California's senior senator said she has believed since childhood that the American flag is a ``unique representation of our Democratic union'' and ``much more than a piece of cloth.''
In 1995, Feinstein joined 49 Republicans and 13 other Democrats in voting for a flag-protection amendment, but it fell three votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority.
She likened the flag to the Constitution, and said burning and desecrating it goes well beyond the free speech protections provided in the Constitution's First Amendment.
``To me that isn't speech it's conduct,'' she said in an interview.
``In the form of shorts or a T-shirt, it's a piece of cloth,'' Feinstein said.
``But in the form of the flag, it's very special ...
There are two things that unify us, language and our flag.''
``The flag is the overwhelming symbol of our nation,'' Feinstein said.
``People die for it ...
The American flag holds a unique position in our society as the most important and widely recognized representation of our freedom and unity.''
Feinstein, 65, said she recalls seeing a newspaper photo of Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima in the final months of World War II.
``It was one of the most graphic images I have ever seen,'' Feinstein said.
``At the same time that those soldiers raised the flag, they raised the hopes and the spirits of the entire nation.''
Veterans groups have lobbied for the amendment this year and in the past.
``This is a very big issue for them,'' Feinstein said, adding that many soldiers ``carried the flag into battle and died for it.''
The flag amendment has wide support from Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., whose support is crucial for moving the issue to the floor for a vote.
Spearheading the amendment is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah.
Feinstein's position runs counter to that of many Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., who has said the flag is important, ``but freedom of speech is more important.''
Other foes of the amendment say flag burnings or other methods of flag desecration are extremely rare and don't warrant altering the Constitution.
The Citizens Flag Alliance, a group pushing the amendment, says it can count 64 senators for the amendment, which needs 67 votes or two-thirds of the senators present to pass.
The proposed amendment, which would carve out an exception to the First Amendment by giving Congress the power to enact laws against flag desecration, has already won House approval.
If it passes the Senate, the amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states.
Polls indicate a majority of voters favor the flag amendment and 49 states have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve it.
The flag amendment would overturn U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 1989 and 1990 that struck down state and federal flag desecration laws as unconstitutional violations of freedom of speech.
In June 1997, the House voted 310-114 House vote in favor of the amendment.
The 1995 flag amendment passed the House by a 312-120 vote before failing in the Senate.
That amendment would have allowed state legislatures as well as Congress to enact flag-protection laws.
