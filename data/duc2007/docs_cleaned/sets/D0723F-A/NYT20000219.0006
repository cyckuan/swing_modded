And she has been biding her time during the primary campaign, confidently preparing to take on Rep. Tom Campbell, the presumptive Republican nominee, in November.
This may not be as good as it gets in politics, but this is as good as it has ever been for Feinstein.
``People know me,'' she told the Chronicle during an interview last weekend.
``We take the public trust very seriously, and I think people believe, by and large, that I've honored my commitments.''
It's a long way from 10 years ago, when Feinstein, now 67, was running for governor and was booed at a state Democratic convention for declaring her support for the death penalty.
Feinstein was the outsider then, running for the nomination against Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who had the support of virtually every major state Democrat.
She won the primary and lost narrowly to Republican Pete Wilson.
Two years later, she ran for the Senate.
She defeated John Seymour, Wilson's hand-picked successor, and got more votes than any Senate candidate in American history.
In 1994, because she was finishing Wilson's incomplete term, Feinstein was on the ballot again, running for re-election against Republican Rep. Michael Huffington.
Huffington spent $30 million attacking Feinstein and came within 163,000 votes of defeating her.
But today she holds a commanding lead in the polls: 5 to 1 over Campbell in the most recent Field Poll, more than 2 to 1 over all Republican opponents combined.
Her support cuts across party lines, cuts across ethnic and gender lines and runs the gamut of the political spectrum.
``She's perceived as carrying herself with dignity and grace, as a senator who's knowledgeable, on the job, paying attention to what's going on,'' said pollster Mervin Field.
In fact, Feinstein even seized the middle ground during the impeachment controversy, expressing outrage at President Clinton's personal conduct while maintaining support for his policies.
It was ``the perfect position,'' said Field.
``Dianne has always appealed to the same middle everybody talked about Clinton appealing to,'' said veteran Democratic strategist Darry Sragow.
``It took people a long time to figure that out because she was the mayor of San Francisco, and they assumed she had to be a liberal.
She's always been a centrist.''
As such, she has benefited from the public perception that Clinton's centrist policies have been effective in spurring the nation's economic boom, and that she has been a consistent supporter of legislation to drive down the federal budget deficit.
She also has benefited from one major centrist move by Clinton turning gun control into a tough-on-crime position, which Feinstein has embraced as a central issue to her legislative career.
She is at her most passionate when decrying the ``trickle-down of guns to children'' and the ``nation awash in guns,'' and vowing to push through yet more legislation that will regulate the sale and distribution of handguns and assault rifles.
Her popularity in California is one reason she is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore, should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.
She would be permitted to run for both vice president and senator on the same ballot.
Feinstein has endorsed Gore, but she declined to comment on the possibility of running with him.
If it were to happen, I'd certainly think about it,'' she said.
Feinstein also recalled that she was mentioned in the same way in 1984, when then-Democratic nominee Walter Mondale selected New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate.
Meanwhile, Feinstein is sitting on a campaign treasury of more than $2.6 million.
She also has in place a veteran team of campaign advisers, many of whom have been with her through all her campaigns of the past decade.
Her only opposition in the Democratic primary is Emeryville attorney Michael Schmier, who admits he has no money with which to mount a challenge against Feinstein.
He is running largely to protest the dwindling number of appellate cases that are published for public review.
Feinstein's time has been spent preparing for the general election.
Last year, her campaign spent nearly $900,000 on an intense telemarketing campaign, signing up small donors in the $5 to $10 range who also will commit to doing volunteer work when it comes time to turn out voters at the end of the campaign.
Campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the telemarketing effort has raised more than $1.1 million in small donations and has generated a list of more than 125,000 people who will serve as a grassroots army.
``We're still trying to figure out if we're going to go on TV in the primary.
We haven't made that decision,'' said Kuwata.
Feinstein campaign officials say they want to see what kind of advertising Campbell airs.
He is expected to begin a statewide TV advertising effort late this week or early next week.
Campbell began his campaign with a call for replacing the income tax with a national sales tax and allowing local governments to initiate programs to provide free drugs to drug addicts.
His unconventional proposals mystified Feinstein and her top advisers.
``He's sort of a strange candidate,'' said Feinstein media consultant Bill Carrick.
That would be much to the evident relief of Feinstein, who still has unpleasant memories of the the race against Huffington, who ran ads on television all but two weeks of the 11-month campaign.
Huffington's blitz began in January, when he bought a full minute of TV prime time during the telecast of the Winter Olympics and attacked Feinstein for her vote supporting the Clinton administration's budget deficit reduction package.
Feinstein was watching at home, and ``my gut went, `Oooohhh,' '' she said.
Asked how her gut reacted when she saw that Campbell began this campaign with a call for a national sales tax and a drug giveaway, Feinstein said, ``My gut relaxed.''
