Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell, conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
Feinstein said Mexican drug cartels must be targeted ``like a laser beam.''
``The cartels of Mexico today are stronger than Mafia organized crime ever was and I believe they represent a threat to the U.S.,'' Feinstein told a news conference.
``Our enemies should be the cartels, not Mexico vs. the U.S.'' Feinstein stressed that she doesn't want to hurt trade or friendship with Mexico and that she believes top Mexican government officials are ``doing their level best'' to fight drug trafficking.
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Coverdell, R-Ga., have led past unsuccessful Senate efforts to override administration certifications of Mexico.
Coverdell said the bill would focus on ``bad actors'' in Mexico, as opposed to seeking to override the administration's decision to certify Mexico.
``While we're not decertifying Mexico, we're decertifying the cartels,'' he said.
Coverdell said he and Feinstein ``adamantly oppose'' efforts to repeal the law that requires the administration to give annual certifications to Congress that Mexico or other nations with drug-trafficking histories are cooperating in the U.S. war against drugs.
If a foreign country loses an annual certification, it could risk losing U.S. aid.
Coverdell acknowledged that Congress won't repeal the certification of Mexico this year.
The Feinstein-Coverdell proposal targets foreign narcotics dealers considered a threat to U.S. national security.
It would freeze the assets of drug traffickers and ban their related businesses either front businesses or those run from drug profits from trading with American companies.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would draw up a list of narcotics traffickers and impose criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation or $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for American companies that do business with them.
In Colombia, the U.S. government has targeted and financially crippled a drug store chain, a poultry business and pharmaceutical laboratories connected to drug cartels.
Meanwhile, efforts were continuing in the House to strip Mexico of its certification.
President Clinton on Feb. 26 certified to Congress that Mexico is a fully cooperating drug-fighting ally.
Congress has 30 days from that date to overturn the president's decision, a prospect that seems highly unlikely.
Mexico's certification has been renewed 13 times since 1986 when the annual process went into effect.
Reps. John Mica, R-Fla., Clay E. Shaw Jr., R-Fla., and Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., introduced a resolution Tuesday to decertify Mexico in what they said was a first step toward overturning the certification.
Mica said America is ``on the verge of having a state to the south of us that is an ally become a narco-terrorist.''
Bachus called Clinton's decision to certify Mexico ``a sham.''
``To certify Mexico is to make a mockery out of the certification system,'' he said.
Bachus acknowledged he faced ``an uphill battle,'' and said he has no assurances that the House will actually vote on the resolution.
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said this year's recertification ``cheapens and degrades'' the work and sacrifices that other countries are making to fight drug trafficking.
The following countries are subject to the re-certification process: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and Vietnam.
