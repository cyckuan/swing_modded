Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday that the ``time is right'' for a woman to be on the Democratic ticket but she bristled at the notion that she is the most likely candidate.
Gauging Feinstein's chances of being the Democratic vice presidential nominee is a popular though vexing pastime for many Washington pundits.
The former San Francisco mayor has long been regarded an attractive running mate for whoever wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and the speculation has intensified in light of polls indicating that Vice President Al Gore is struggling to maintain his advantage among women and Californians.
Feinstein provides little guidance, showing little interest or patience with the topic Displaying a coyness that has become a trademark during her 30-plus years in politics, Feinstein sipped orange juice and brushed aside questions attempting to assess her interest, acknowledging that such talk a year before the election ``makes me uncomfortable.''
``It builds up an expectation that I really don't see there,'' Feinstein said.
The probability is very strong that I will be United States senator.''
Feinstein told reporters that she is focused on the issues she believes will form the core of her re-election bid: Improving health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns, eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together opposing sides in California's long-running water wars.
Feinstein is an overwhelming favorite to win re-election.
The only announced Republican challenger is Bill Horn, a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors who is almost completely unknown elsewhere in the state.
Although technically she can run for both senator and vice president at the same time, it would be awkward at best and could threaten what now appears to be an easy re-election, several aides said.
Then there is the indelicate matter of her age.
The only reason Feinstein would accept No.
