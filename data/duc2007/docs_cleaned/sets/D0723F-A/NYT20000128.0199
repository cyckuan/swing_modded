With one arm around each of the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday reassured them that American law is on their side and predicted their grandson will be returned to his father in Cuba.
After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, Feinstein described them as ``heartbroken'' and ``sobbing'' and said she would do ``whatever I can'' to protect their rights.
``Grandmothers should not have to go through this and politics should not enter into it,'' she said.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the American relatives of Elian Gonzalez, 6, to return the boy to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba.
Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the time, was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
Meanwhile Friday, the Florida nun whose Miami Beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers abruptly threw off her impartiality and came out in favor of keeping the boy in the United States.
Following a meeting with members of Congress in Washington, Dominican Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said: ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of political agendas.
Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least for a while.''
O'Laughlin also met with Attorney General Jane Reno in hopes of persuading her to withdraw the INS order to send the boy back to Cuba.
But Reno, who oversees the immigration agency, refused to budge.
Besides Feinstein, the women met with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and George R. Nethercutt Jr., R-Wash. Feinstein said she told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and immigration policies are on their side.
``Elian has a father who loves him and has a home for him in Cuba.
In our society there are basic rights that includes the right of a father to have a son back.''
Feinstein called congressional efforts to grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship so he can remain with his Florida relatives are ``terrible.''
Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are fighting to prevent his return to Cuba, arguing that it was the wish of his mother for the boy to live in the United States.
Feinstein, however, said ``a gold chain, a baseball cap, a trip to Disney Land and American razzle-dazzle'' are confusing the 6-year-old boy.
She added that if the Cuban boy returns home and the father decides to bring Elian back to the United States ``on his own volition, that's another story.''
