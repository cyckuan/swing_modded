For the first time since reading the special prosecutor's report on President Clinton's affair with a onetime intern, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the president about it.
But Feinstein, D-Calif., said talk about whether Clinton should resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed to play out.
In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the 1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only increases animosity'' from Republicans.
``This was an intern,'' Feinstein said, referring to Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
``This was something while he was president.
That's its pertinence.
The fact that it was in the White House, in the Oval Office.''
Hyde, R-Ill., has acknowledged the affair occurred.
It took place in the 1960s, before Hyde ran for Congress.
Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton's aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair.
Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president but has consulted on other matters with members of his administration.
``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein, who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has assiduously courted throughout his presidency.
``This is the kind of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me.''
However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and disappointment from what I have to do as a senator.'
Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct.
But most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from office because of an extramarital relationship.
Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a videotape of the president's Aug. 17 testimony before the federal grand jury investigating his conduct.
After the testimony, Clinton went on national television and admitted having an extramarital relationship with Lewinsky.
``If there's something that adds light to the situation and is pertinent to the situation, it might be a wise thing to do,'' Feinstein said.
``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I don't think that's what it should be about.''
She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses.
The Starr report accused the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.
Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he had ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed that for seven months.
Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more certain.
But then she was shattered.
``On August 17, when I heard the statement, my world came crashing down,'' Feinstein said.
At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the president's credibility was badly ``shattered.''
Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.
``Some people are in tears, some are irate and some are extraordinarily supportive of the president,'' she said.
``This has a long, long tail on it.
It's not just the president.
It's the future of the American presidency too.''
If Clinton is to survive the scandal, ``he will need to show he will continue to be a strong president,'' Feinstein said.
``That's where the jury's out.''
