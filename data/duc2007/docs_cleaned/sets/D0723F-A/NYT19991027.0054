Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is over.
Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep. Tom Campbell's entry Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national significance.
Campbell's experience, fund-raising ability and moderate positions instantly make him the front-runner in a crowded field of largely unknown GOP candidates.
Feinstein must now engage in a far more aggressive campaign, while Democratic Party leaders no longer will be able to ignore the California contest in favor of headline grabbers such as Hillary Rodham Clinton's quest for a New York Senate seat.
And the sudden intensity diminishes the likelihood that Feinstein will be named to the Democratic ticket as either Al Gore or Bill Bradley's running mate.
``Tom Campbell has won elections,'' said Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.
``He's a serious person and not a joke.''
Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at her level, must now gird for another tough contest, her fourth statewide battle of the decade.
``Campbell is a much smarter, more experienced and much more adroit candidate'' than Feinstein's previous Senate opponents, said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who served as former Gov.
