Sen. Barbara Boxer is fighting to re-establish what some analysts say could be her greatest asset in her race for re-election: incumbency.
In a campaign swing through California's fertile Central Valley, the Democratic incumbent reminded voters of her service in Washington over the past six years.
``We did a lot together,'' Boxer told 50 supporters Thursday at an event in Stockton highlighting her support for the 1994 crime bill, which provided funding for 173 new police officers in that city.
The trip comes as a new poll by the Los Angeles Times shows Boxer pulling slightly ahead of her Republican opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong, by 5 percentage points, 49 percent to 44 percent, among those likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election.
That is seen as less a sign of a newfound popularity for Boxer than proof the negative commercials she has begun running against Fong on issues like abortion and the environment are cutting into his support.
Some political observers have criticized Boxer for doing little in her race against Fong to remind voters that she is a sitting senator at a time when the economy is solid, crime is down and voters are generally content.
``She needs to focus on what she has delivered for California,'' said Barbara O'Connor, communications professor at California State University in Sacramento.
``She needs to highlight what she's been able to bring home.''
With just days before the election, both Boxer and Fong are crisscrossing the state.
Each is still furiously raising money in order to plaster voters with expensive, last-minute television commercials.
For Fong, the campaign has become nearly all fund-raising, with rarely more than one public event a day.
He explains that he has held public events throughout the campaign, but must now focus on securing cash.
``As a challenger, I need to raise the dollars to compete,'' Fong said after a $125,000 fund-raiser in San Francisco Wednesday night.
Citing the new barrage of negative ads against him, ``I have to answer those charges, and that's what we're doing.''
Fong, who adeptly used the President Clinton's affair with a former White House intern to bash Boxer early in the race, is now seeking to weaken her by linking her to labor unions and trial lawyers, who have been among the largest contributors to her campaign.
At a luncheon Wednesday at the San Jose Rotary Club, he accused Boxer of siding with the trial lawyers who supported Proposition 211, a failed measure to allow shareholder lawsuits against companies if their stock price plummeted.
Many Silicon Valley companies fought the initiative.
He also said Boxer sided with labor union bosses in opposing broader trade-negotiating powers for the president.
Fong is counting on supporters like Helen Buckholtz, a Portola Valley Republican, who said she supports Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, but won't vote for Boxer because she's ``too negative, too partisan.''
Boxer's Central Valley campaign tour Thursday took her through some areas where she has had little support in the past.
In her 1992 election, her opponent, conservative television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, out-polled her in several key Central Valley counties: Fresno (55 percent to 37 percent), Merced (49 percent to 39 percent) and Madera (60 percent to 32 percent).
Public Policy Institute of California poll last week showed Boxer trailing Fong in the more conservative Central Valley, but had her in a dead heat with her Republican challenger statewide.
