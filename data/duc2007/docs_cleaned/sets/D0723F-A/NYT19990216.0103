This scandal that was, to many, all about sex and the married man closes with an unexpected twist: Women come out winners.
Meager winnings, maybe, for the female leads in the yearlong soap opera.
Paula Jones got her money and a makeover.
Monica S. Lewinsky has a big book deal and bragging rights for a boffo performance before the House impeachment managers.
Even the vilified Linda R. Tripp has embarked on a network TV image-enhancement tour.
But just as ``the year of the woman candidate'' followed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's sexually charged confirmation hearings in 1991, many think women will benefit politically from Washington's toxic mix of sex, machismo, and partisanship that ended Friday with President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial.
It's no coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Dianne Feinstein suddenly are being touted as women who can win high office in 2000 even though none has said she will be running for office.
``For heaven's sake, look what we have been put through because of the foibles of Washington's failed old-boy network,'' said Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
``People think they can clean things up by electing a woman who is more honest, more compassionate, more authentic, and, true or not, not as prone to the kinds of sexual peccadillos that men are.''
This week, Dole, a two-time Republican Cabinet secretary and the recently retired head of the American Red Cross, debuted on the political stage with a speech in New Hampshire that included several references to her gender and repeated calls for restoring integrity and moral leadership in the White House.
``There's been a little speculation that I might run for president,'' said Dole, who is expected to formally announce her intention to do that this week.
``If I run, this will be an important reason why: The United States deserves a government that is worthy of her people.''
Polls show Dole, who is married to former senator Bob Dole, the 1996 presidential candidate, not only has a shot at the top of the GOP White House field but also would defeat Vice President Al Gore in a head-to-head matchup today.
But her dignified handling of a public embarrassment, a political crisis, and certainly, a personal ordeal, won Mrs. Clinton a combination of respect and sympathy that sent her once-sagging popularity through the ceiling.
Mrs. Clinton also dived into last fall's elections, campaigning where her beleaguered husband couldn't and proving that she could pump up huge crowds and make the difference for Democrats in tight races.
Now she is being wooed by New York Democrats to run for an open Senate seat in 2000 ``It's wait and see, give her time,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
``She has not ruled it in or out.''
Berry said the first lady is ``gracious and listens'' to New Yorkers who are promoting her candidacy, but she refuses to discuss it, or even think about it, until the impeachment issue is gone.
President Clinton, however, brought it up at a recent fund-raising dinner in Manhattan, quipping that he might be remembered as ``the person who comes with Hillary to New York.''
``Hillary's political standing has vastly improved, but isn't it a terrible irony that people who didn't like her because of her independence, intelligence, and ambition, found her a much more sympathetic character after she was taken down and humanized as a humiliated wife?''
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, said she thinks Mrs. Clinton ``has an agenda, and she is out there stirring things up.''
Its political action committee met this week to plan ways to promote Feinstein, California's senior senator, as vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2000.
One idea is to have NOW members show up at campaign events featuring Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley with placards that say ``Democrats Deserve Dianne,'' and ``Countdown to D (Dianne)-Day.''
Ireland said NOW officials had not spoken to Feinstein, a proven money-raiser from a state rich with electoral votes, but she did not expect her to ``run from the room and slam the door'' on a vice presidential draft.
Feinstein has gotten attention as a tough and persistent critic of the president's behavior.
``The lesson we learned in the last year is that it is entirely possible to have an administration that is good on the issues and on appointing women and still have a streak of sexism a mile wide,'' said Ireland, in an effort to justify NOW's push to get the second woman on the Democratic ticket.
Former representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York was the first, in 1984.
Unquestionably, President Clinton put women who shared his politics his wife, Democratic lawmakers, and feminist activists on the spot by his relationship with Lewinsky.
The president became a campaign issue last fall for Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, who defended Clinton's record but said they deplored his conduct.
Boxer and Murray were reelected; Moseley-Braun was not.
Feminist leaders were accused of hypocrisy for loudly championing sexual-harassment laws but staying silent when such charges were brought against a president who advocated for women's rights.
``If Democratic women in the House or Senate had turned against him, if feminist groups had abandoned him, or if his wife had indicated at any point that she did not stand by him, it could have been a turning point and tipped the public scales against the president,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the Advancement of Public Policy, a liberal advocacy group for women.
Now, Burk said, ``it's definitely pay-back time.''
Women's groups want the White House to act quickly on their issues: legislation guaranteeing women equal pay for equal but not identical work, improved child care, and recognition of the special needs of older women in any Social Security overhaul plan.
``If that doesn't happen, women who stood by the president are going to be supremely disgusted and look beyond the Democratic Party, particularly if Republicans put forward a good female candidate next year,'' Burk said.
Dole has said she is not interested in the No.
