Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California has gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing that one third of state voters still don't recognize his name.
Campbell campaign officials said they planned to unleash ads this summer that will help the moderate congressman turn the numbers around.
``We have not yet begun to fight,'' said Campbell senior strategist Sean Walsh.
The poll, conducted by Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., showed Feinstein with a formidable 57 percent to 34 percent lead among those who had picked their choice for U.S. Senate if the election were held today.
The poll also showed that 26 percent of Republicans said they preferred Feinstein.
The Silicon Valley congressman is ``the kind of Republican who could win a statewide election, but I don't see a scenario where Campbell could pull off an upset,'' said Ali, whose firm conducted the poll July 17 through 19.
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
The questions were posed to 827 registered voters who vote regularly in state elections.
Republicans and Democrats were divided equally.
Add to Campbell's weak name recognition a bustling economy and voter approval for Feinstein, and the congressman appears to face even more of an uphill battle.
``Incumbents get too much credit when things go well and too much blame when things go bad.
It's a good election cycle to be an incumbent,'' said Ali.
``It always starts with the economic times.
You've got a job, money in the bank, and people feel secure.
They're not going to rock the boat by throwing out the status quo.''
Feinstein, he added, ``would almost have to go out and try to lose the election.''
Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to fulfill the last two years of a six-year term.
When she stood for re-election in 1994, she narrowly beat back a challenge from Republican Michael Huffington.
This is Campbell's second stint in Congress.
He served as a U.S. representative between 1988 and 1992.
He returned to Congress in a special election in 1995 after a brief term in the state Legislature.
He narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. Senate primary in 1992 to ultra-conservative Bruce Herschenson, who in turn was defeated in the general election by liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer a race many observers believed Campbell would have won had he faced her.
The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks before California's March primary, when Feinstein had 54 percent to Campbell's 36 percent.
Last week's poll shows Feinstein doing slightly better than Campbell among men 48 to 44 percent and far better 65 to 24 percent among women.
The poll also shows the senator from San Francisco ahead in every region of the state except for the Central Valley, where each received 44 percent of the vote.
Feinstein was far ahead of Campbell among ethnic groups and Caucasians alike.
Campbell is a pro-abortion rights Republican who sells himself as fiscally conservative but socially more liberal.
Feinstein scored a 57 percent favorable rating, compared to a 23 percent rating for Campbell.
Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the School of Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate University said Feinstein probably earned points among Democrats and Republicans alike by coming out early in her criticisms of President Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
``It showed her independence and values and toughness.
Voters appreciate that even if the people who work with her do not,'' said Jeffe.
``She doesn't toe an ideological partisan line and that's where voters are these days.''
Walsh said the Campbell campaign was gearing up for an aggressive race, and planned to start defining the soft-spoken congressman long before Labor Day, the unofficial kickoff day for the November election.
Walsh said Campbell has been called ``the smartest man in Congress'' by Roll Call magazine.
But he acknowledged: ``We have to raise his name ID and profile.''
