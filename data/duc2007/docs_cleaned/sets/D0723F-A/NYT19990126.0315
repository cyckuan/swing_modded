Some Senate Democrats said Tuesday they will seriously consider a resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D.-Calif., condemning President Clinton's conduct in trying to cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate, lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
Feinstein's resolution would censure him for both having the affair and then concealing it from his cabinet, other government officials and the nation.
The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but instead focuses on presidential misconduct.
The resolution neither clears the president of criminal behavior nor implicates him.
Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two articles of impeachment now being tried.
Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Feinstein's resolution is the first of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the resolution.
He added that lawmakers need to find the exact, appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional muster.
``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was appropriate,'' Reed said.
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said many senators feel that if Clinton is acquitted, ``something needs to be on the record'' that condemns him for his actions.
Some conservative Republicans have said they won't back such a measure.
For instance, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, has argued that the Senate cannot censure a president because it would violate the separation-of-powers clause in the Constitution.
But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of impeachment.
Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have 45 seats.
Feinstein's measure would be considered as a non-binding resolution that does not require a House vote or Clinton's signature.
Both the House and Senate often approve non-binding resolutions on various subjects such as supporting U.S. troops in Iraq.
Democrats maintain that if a censure resolution is non-binding, it will not pose any constitutional problems.
There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.
Asked about Feinstein's proposal, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. said it now appears that witnesses will be called and that there's no way to tell if censure will come up.
``Once you start a trial process, you don't know where and how it's going to end,'' Schumer said.
He added that the atmosphere is likely to get highly partisan and ``that could damage the Senate not just now but later on.''
