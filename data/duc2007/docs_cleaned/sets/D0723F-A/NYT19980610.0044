In an effort to resolve bitter differences over data encryption, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., brokered a meeting Tuesday between several prominent high-tech executives and top law enforcement officials.
The closed-door discussion brought together for the first time FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and such high-tech leaders as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to review the data-scrambling technology, which keeps computer communications private.
Freeh wants the FBI to be able to access encryption codes for wire-tapping and other criminal investigations.
The computer industry contends that such efforts threaten privacy and free speech.
The Clinton administration also wants to maintain controls over exports of U.S. encryption technology.
The industry argues that the controls put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, hamper innovation and ultimately undermine their lead in technology.
Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology, terrorism and government information.
Feinstein said in a statement that she has ``developed a strong interest'' in encryption, and that when she learned that Freeh ``had not had the opportunity to talk directly with the CEOs of American high-tech companies regarding his concerns,'' she offered to organize a meeting.
The meeting allied Gates with some computer executives who have frequently been his harshest critics Jim Barksdale, president of Netscape; Scott McNealy, chief executive officer of Sun Microsystems; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell as well as Steve Case, chief executive officer of America Online.
Other law enforcement officials included Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bobby Moody, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and William Murphy, president of the National District Attorneys Association.
All declined to divulge details about the meeting.
