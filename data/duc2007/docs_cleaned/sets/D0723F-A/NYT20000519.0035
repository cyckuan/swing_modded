Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Republican opponent charged Thursday that her support of normalizing trade with China could financially benefit her billionaire husband, Richard Blum.
Rep. Tom Campbell said Feinstein left blanks on her 1999 federal statement of economic interests that could mask substantial investment in China by Blum.
In 1997, Blum said he had invested as much as $2 million in various Chinese ventures.
Feinstein said Thursday that she and her husband dumped all their investments in China after the May 1999 economic statement was filed.
In the past, she insisted she maintained a ``fire wall'' between her senatorial duties and Blum's far-flung financial dealings.
``Neither Dianne nor her husband have any holdings in mainland China,'' said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager.
``We fill out these forms very carefully.
If Dianne Feinstein had done something that's not complete, wouldn't we have heard about it?''
The issue of her husband's investments has dogged Feinstein since she was elected to the Senate in 1992.
The possibility of a conflict of interest was raised in 1996 by her last GOP opponent, Mike Huffington.
Campbell, who has vowed not to make Blum's far-flung business dealings an issue, said Thursday he was criticizing Feinstein, not Blum, for failing to disclose the scope of the couple's holdings.
``Failure to disclose is the senator's responsibility,'' Campbell said.
``You go to the pages.
You see empty columns.
That's her responsibility.''
But Kuwata said Campbell was wrong when he said Feinstein had left the value of 14 investments blank.
The value is listed later, Kuwata said, under each investment's assets, not after its title.
Campbell said Feinstein could settle the issue by releasing her 2000 economic statement, which was filed earlier this month with the Senate Ethics Committee.
Under its normal policy, the committee will make the document public next month.
That will be after the Senate vote on granting China permanent normal trade status.
In 1997, when Feinstein's opposition to stripping China of most favored nation trading status led to questions of the benefit to Blum's investments, Blum promised that any future profits from China would be donated to the American Himalayan Foundation.
Blum founded the charity in 1979 to help Tibetans oppressed by the Chinese government.
``This should remove any perception that I, in any way ... benefit from or influence my wife's position on China,'' Blum told The Chronicle at the time.
Kuwata said none of Blum's Chinese investments turned a profit.
The 1999 statement does show Blum maintaining a $100,000 to $250,000 investment in Newbridge Capital Ltd., a Hong Kong-based joint venture that coordinates Blum's investments in China.
One of Blum's limited partnerships that holds an interest in Newbridge is Golden China, L.P., whose assets were listed at between $500,000 to $1 million.
Golden China was valued at between $250,000 and $500,000 in Feinstein's 1996 financial disclosure statement.
Feinstein's 1999 statement also included another limited partnership called Shanghai Pacific Partners.
It was valued at less than $1,000.
On her 1996 form, Shanghai Pacific Partners was valued between $500,000 and $1 million.
