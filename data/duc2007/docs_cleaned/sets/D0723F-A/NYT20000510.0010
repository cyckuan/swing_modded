Declaring that the power of a million moms can defeat the gun lobby, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation Tuesday to require that gun owners obtain licenses and register their firearms.
Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National Mall in support of gun control.
Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential campaign.''
The Democratic senator's legislation would impose requirements on gun owners similar to those that exist for drivers.
Owners of handguns, and semiautomatic firearms that use detachable magazines, would need licenses, which would cost $25.
All sales of such weapons would be recorded and the information transmitted to the Treasury Department.
``The time has come to say enough is enough and demand of Congress the passage of commonsense gun laws,'' Feinstein said in a Capitol Hill news conference.

``In this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license.
But when you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary,'' Feinstein said.
``That makes no sense.''
Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun forces in Congress.
Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group, its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and said licensing and registration is their top priority.
Several far more modest gun control measures including legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows were passed by the Senate last year.
However, they were not approved by the House and are now languishing in a conference committee.
Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,'' she said, ``and this is the women in America.''
Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change if Democrats prevail in November's election.
Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 250,000 supporters to the National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue, a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by guns every year.
Organizers said they ``want to show the American public that not all women are pro-gun control.''
The two marches will be on opposite sides of the Washington Monument.
The Million Mom March will go east from the monument to the Capitol, while the Armed Informed Mothers' March will go west toward the Lincoln Memorial.
Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia-Hupp will be the keynote speaker at the pro-gun march.
Gratia-Hupp was in a restaurant in Killeen, Texas, in 1991 when a lone gunman killed 21 people in a shooting spree, including her parents.
She said she believes she could have saved lives, had she been armed, by shooting the gunman.
Only two politicians will speak at the gun control rally: Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed by a gunman on a Long Island commuter train, and Maryland Lt. Gov.
