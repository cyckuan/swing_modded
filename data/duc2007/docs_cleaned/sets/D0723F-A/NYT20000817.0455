Democratic women senators headlined a breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday to celebrate women in Congress.
Of course, in the U.S. Senate there are only nine of them, but the speakers, including California Sens.
Barbara Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work hard to elect more.
``Women today are the major political force in this country,'' said Feinstein to the 150 guests, many of whom quickly erupted into applause.
When the cheering quieted, Feinstein said, ``I didn't see a single man clapping.''
Of the 1,852 people who have served in the United States Senate, 27 have been women, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Of the women, 12 served for a day or two to fill in for their husbands who had just died, she said.
``We are really proud that our husbands did not have to die in order for us to serve,'' said Murray, who hosted the breakfast sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
The committee has hosted numerous events this week at exclusive locales, such as Spago.
The breakfast Thursday was one of only three events open to the press.
The effects of the seemingly endless week of socializing and political promoting were showing Thursday morning.
Guests guzzled coffee in preparation for the final day of convention activities.
``In hindsight, we should have scheduled (the breakfast) a little earlier in the week or a little later in the morning,'' said Ed Tobin, an executive at Microsoft who introduced Murray.
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said she's been so excited since she arrived in Los Angeles that she lost her voice.
But she quickly found a doctor to fix her up.
And who better than Barbra Streisand's doc?
The singer's doctor told her, ``If you follow these instructions, you'll never be able to sing like Barbra, but you'll be able to talk tomorrow.''
Though Landrieu's voice was still a little raspy, she gave a quick speech and was off to the next event.
