After three weeks of lobbying and 25 different versions of a censure resolution condemning President Clinton but not convicting him, Sen. Dianne Feinstein still couldn't find the magic language.
Every time she used tougher words to win Republican support, she would lose Democrats.
When she softened the language, she would lose Republicans.
In the end, she couldn't muster the 67 votes needed to allow a floor vote on her resolution.
Censure was as dead as the House campaign to convict the president.
``Everything caused problems, every preposition, every adjective, every adverb,'' Feinstein said Friday.
``We tried to incorporate every suggestion everybody made but it seemed we lost support on one side every time we picked it up on the other.''
After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to bring up her censure resolution.
But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposed censure because he thought it was unconstitutional, blocked her with a parliamentary tactic.
She needed 67 votes to overcome Gramm and allow a vote on the resolution.
But she only received 56 votes.
In the end, Feinstein's resolution was placed into the Congressional Record but not adopted by the Senate.
``It may or may not come up again,'' Feinstein said later, acknowledging that ``people want to get past this.''
``We made a point, because we got the resolution into the Record signed by one-third'' of the Senate, she said.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated that, as far as he was concerned, the matter was closed and the Senate would not take up censure again.
``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I think, the Senate is tired.''
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that since a vote on censure wasn't allowed Friday, ``Now is the time to stop.
Let the recriminations stop.
It's going to take a while to put some of these pieces back together.''
In its final form, her three-page censure resolution, signed by 38 senators, condemned Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' behavior in connection with his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It said Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American people,'' ``gave false or misleading testimony'' which ``had the effect of impeding discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.''
The statement said Clinton's conduct demeaned the office of the president and ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.''
Her campaign for censure was aided by Sens.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Robert Bennett, R-Utah and Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who didn't sign Feinstein's censure resolution but voted Friday to allow it to come up for debate, praised her colleague's efforts in tackling such a difficult task.
``Sen. Feinstein deserves a lot of credit,'' Boxer said.
``It shows that Sen. Feinstein is a person who really likes to work both sides of the aisle.
She did a remarkable job.''
Boxer said she signed an early version of the censure resolution but didn't support later, tougher versions.
Lieberman praised Feinstein for being ``very persistent and very principled'' in her fight to bring a censure resolution to the floor.
Although Feinstein has sided with Clinton on many issues, including the 1994 legislation that banned 19 types of assault weapons, she became the first Senate Democrat to publicly scold Clinton for lying about his relationship to the American people.
``My trust in his credibility has been badly shattered,'' she said.
She was referring to the now-famous finger-wagging denial by the president that he had ever ``had sexual relations with that woman.''
Shortly afterward, Lieberman, another influential Democrat made a floor speech harshly condemning Clinton's conduct.
That was followed by an increasing chorus of Democrats who expressed their disillusionment with Clinton's behavior.
Feinstein has since rebuffed attempts by Clinton to discuss the Lewinsky affair with her, although she has corresponded with him on other matters, such as getting federal aid for citrus crops in California's central valley that were damaged in December by a freeze.
The Clinton administration responded by approving federal aid for victims of that freeze disaster, including $1.7 million for farm workers who lost their jobs.
After the Senate vote to acquit Clinton, Feinstein scheduled a news conference at 1:30 p.m. to discuss censure.
But a bomb threat caused Capitol police to order an emergency evacuation, forcing Feinstein to cancel the news conference.
Asked about her future relations with the president, Feinstein said the ball now is in his court.
``We've just been through a year of trauma,'' Feinstein said.
``''He's been our leader he is our leader and we have to come to terms with this...
The president is speaking about reconciliation.
The president is the one who brought this on and reconciliation is up to him.''
