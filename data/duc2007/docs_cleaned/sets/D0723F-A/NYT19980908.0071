Whether President Clinton corrupted Monica Lewinsky is a subject for clergymen.
That he has corrupted the language in undeniable.
Caught having sex with the intern, he denied having ``sexual relations.''
It's the listener's fault, he insisted last month on national television, for not catching his drift.
He regretted having ``misled'' us.
The coming of September has brought a new cargo of verbal rubble.
It was not until Friday that the man who admitted to a liaison that was ``not appropriate'' could be coaxed to utter the two words that properly express an apology.
Again, the blame for the failed communication is hung on the listener.
From Moscow, a disappointed Clinton says that he has gone to the trouble of re-reading his Aug. 17 televised speech to the nation and can find no deficiency.
Again, it must be the listener's fault.
If the man in the Oval Office remains tongued-tied about his behavior during all those 18 months in the room adjoining the Oval Office and all those seven months of brazen cover-up another American leader is teaching us the power of a few words spoken with conviction.
``His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense of sadness in that my trust in his credibility had been badly shattered.''
This was Sen. Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the president's address on Aug. 17.
Feinstein, D-Calif., has issued no public statement since.
On the hottest topic in Washington, she has refused to give journalists what they desire most: words.
Yet, followed as it has been by these weeks of heavy silence, Feinstein's statement continues to echo, just as Clinton's can still be heard, thanks to the unforgiving videotape, making that dreadful, point-of-no-return denial back in January.
I'm going to say this again.
To Feinstein, those unforgettable, unretractable words were not those of a politician denying something for which he was embarrassed.
They were the words of a political contract: I'm telling you the truth.
Now, you go out and defend me.
Today Clinton must contend with the outrage of those who spent winter, spring and summer honoring their end of that contract only to learn it was all a sham.
In this twilight struggle, the senator from California has been especially eloquent, conveying the disquiet of her soul in the quiet of her bearing.
Such discretion is enviable in today's climate.
Where Feinstein has avoided the contamination of the Lewinsky Affair, others have not been so lucky.
She has learned the hard way that once a few words have been spoken on this sordid affair, the surest way to protect your honor is to keep your distance; the best way to declare your outrage is to keep an impressive silence.
