Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California In 1992, Californians made history by pulling the lever for both Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
In her eight years in Washington, Feinstein, a native Californian and the former mayor of San Francisco, has quietly pushed for anti-crime legislation and issues close to home.
One of her biggest victories was attaching an assault weapons ban to the crime bill passed by President Clinton in 1994.
Boxer is a strong abortion rights advocate who has vigorously fought the ban on partial birth abortion.
Boxer is linked to the Clinton White House by the marriage of Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, to her daughter, Nicole.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland After organizing neighbors to protest the construction of a 16-lane highway through the historic Fells Point area of Baltimore, Barbara Mikulski plunged into politics in the late 1960s.
Then a social worker, Mikulski went on to serve as City Councilwoman in her hometown of Baltimore, before serving in the House from 1976 to 1986 and being elected to the Senate in 1986.
She is also the co-author of two mystery novels with a political twist.
``Capitol Offense'' and ``Capitol Virtues'' sketch the life of a freshman female senator from Pennsylvania who Mikulski has called a ``somewhat younger, somewhat slimmer, but no less politically savvy'' version of herself.
Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996, and with Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, she forms the last of the all-Democratic Senate delegations in the South.
Landrieu grew up in New Orleans, the oldest of nine children of Moon Landrieu, the mayor of the city in the 1970s.
In 1979, after graduating from Louisiana State University, she became, at 23, the youngest woman ever elected to the state Legislature.
She was elected to the Senate in 1996, with a moderate platform.
Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas Growing up on a rice farm in Helena, Ark., Blanche Lambert Lincoln, 39, was elected to the Senate two years ago.
After serving two terms in the House, she took a two-year leave from public life because she was about to give birth to twin boys.
When she ran for the Senate in 1998, she put their pictures on her campaign posters.
Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan Elected to the House in 1996, Debbie Stabenow is involved in what is shaping up to be one of the nation's most bitterly contested Senate races.
She is challenging Sen. Spencer Abraham by highlighting her own legislative record that goes back to 1975, when she became county commissioner by fighting a proposal that would have shut down a local hospital that accepted Medicaid.
