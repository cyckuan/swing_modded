Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.
Her office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office,'' Feinstein said.
Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an alternative to conviction.
She has formed an unlikely alliance with Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, to build support for a censure resolution, though it appeared Thursday that their effort was doomed.
Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions threaten the function of government.
Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her affidavit, Feinstein said.
``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie, but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular, well-respected president has strong support must be considered.''
In the international arena, removing Clinton would be ``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for censure.
``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and indefensible,'' Feinstein said.
``It sent the wrong message to the nation and our children.''
While it does not threaten the security and stability of the nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and censure, and there should be a formal means for senators ... to express this condemnation.''
Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a ``legislative measure'' through which senators could express ``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth.''
Feinstein's California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton.
But unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other work.''
Republican opposition to censure is growing, presenting a high hurdle to Feinstein and other censure advocates.
Moving a censure resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate 67 votes to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said.
