the military dictatorship ruining Burma.
It is becoming harder and harder for ASEAN members to ignore the depredations of the Burmese junta.
No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's crimes than host Thailand.
For much of the past decade, the Thais have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military officers.
At the recent AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, rightly praised the Thai government for its success in implementing policies to reduce the spread of HIV.
But the uniformed thugs who rule Burma are undermining those hard-won triumphs.
Whereas Bangkok has achieved exemplary progress in substituting legal cash crops for the poppies used to make heroin, Burma under the junta continues to be a principal source for the heroin that destroys lives from Bangkok to Boston.
And where there is heroin addiction there is an inevitable increase in the rate of HIV infections and cases of AIDS.
Recently, a new evil has come cascading into Thailand from Burma: millions of easily smuggled tablets of the stimulant methamphetamine.
Although noninterference in the internal affairs of member states is a founding principle of ASEAN, the cross-border flow of narcotics, HIV, and refugees into Thailand demonstrates the folly of pretending that Burma's ASEAN neighbors are not affected by the junta's misrule.
``Lack of good governance is at the root of our country's troubles,'' the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Aung San Suu Kyi, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article.
They should pressure Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi, Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately denied its right to govern by the military.
