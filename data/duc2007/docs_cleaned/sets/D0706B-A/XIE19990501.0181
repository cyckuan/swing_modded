total of 26 members of various anti-government armed groups surrendered to the Myanmar government in March, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
These armed group members included those from the ethnic Lahu, All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the remnants of the former drug trafficking Mong Tai Army (MTA).
They laid down their arms in different military command areas including the Triangle Region and the Coastal Region.
In armed opposition to the Myanmar government, the Lahu, the ABSDF and the MTA reportedly operate in the Myanmar-Thai border areas.
According to official statistics, more than 500 members from various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace" with the government last year.
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as the MTA have made peace with the government.
