Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover.
Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro is scheduled to visit Myanmar, also known as Burma, from Sept. 15-18.
It will be his final trip to Thailand's western neighbor as he is scheduled to retire this year.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962.
The current military government came to power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement.
The All Burma Students Democratic Front asked Chuan in a letter on Friday to urge the army chief to reschedule his trip.
``Thailand is a democratic country and the military government in Burma killed many people in 1988.
Recently they have arrested nearly a thousand members of opposition parties,'' said Aung Naing Oo, chairman of the ABSDF.
He said Chetta's trip would create a negative image for the Thai government and the Myanmar military would use the visit for propaganda.
