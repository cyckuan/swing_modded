At least 20 more members of various anti-government armed groups in Myanmar surrendered to the government last month, the Mirror newspaper reported Thursday.
These members, who "exchanged arms for peace" in the southern, eastern and south-eastern areas in December 1997, belonged to the Kayin National Union (KNU), All Burma Students' Democratic Front and some other ethnic armed groups.
They brought in some arms and ammunition, the report said.
According to a latest official disclosure, a total of 15 anti-government ethnic armed groups have made peace with the government, leaving only one, the KNU, still in insurgency.
