Nearly 50 Burmese men, women and children demonstrated in the capital on Friday against military rule in their country.
The protesters, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh over the years, waved placards that read ``We want restoration of democracy in Burma.''
The demonstration was staged to mark the 10th anniversary of the seizure of power by military generals in Maynmar, formerly Burma.
``We want the military to hand over power to our National League for Democracy which won the elections in 1990,'' Ani Maung, a protest leader said.
In Dhaka the refugees are looked after by the United Nations.
