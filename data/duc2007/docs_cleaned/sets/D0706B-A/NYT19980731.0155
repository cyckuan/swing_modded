(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
The SLORC State Law and Order Restoration Council which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat.
She heads the country's popular opposition movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese people.
Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against British colonial rule in 1947.
He was assassinated that same year at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2.
Aung San remains a legend and a national hero in Burma.
There are statues of him, streets named for him and museums of his life.
His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill, which the SLORC yanked from circulation.
His portrait on this bill greatly resembles his daughter.
Pro-democracy protesters have adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag of freedom.
It has come to be known as the ``democracy note.''
This was soon after a bloody takeover by the SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the streets.
In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory even though was under house arrest.
The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi, whose was placed under house arrest.
In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an end.''
For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering questions the people submitted to her.
Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and listen to the lady.
But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995 has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest.
The authorities have arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from meeting with journalists and diplomats.
If they leave her house, her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of Burma's horrific prisons.
When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while again under house arrest Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades.''
The SLORC buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade and foreign investment shows no intention of turning over power peacefully.
Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the horizon.
Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997, shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters.
It was, the world press noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing to intervene.
The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a serious threat to your security.
What were your thoughts in that moment when your car was being attacked?
It was quite interesting.
(She laughs.)
There were all these faces crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big gash in my windscreen.
One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down and telling him not to be angry.
But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt to harm us badly or even kill us.
It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious than the safety and security of the people in general.
In the United States, some cities and the state of Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that deal with Burma.
Is this an effective means of supporting democratization in Burma?
Very much so.
We would like to see more of this.
It's consumer power.
It's good to know that the people of different countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help Burma.
In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called ``Visit Myanmar Year.''
Are you still calling for tourists to boycott Burma?
Yes, my mind has not changed in any way.
Burma is not going to run away.
They should come back to Burma at a time when it is a democratic society where there is justice, where there is rule of law.
They'll have a much better time.
And they can travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of heroin on college campuses.
Why is that?
The government appears to be more interested in stamping out political activity than drug addiction.
Very few university students on the campus could get away with engaging in political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with taking drugs.
We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on the campuses.
Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' the same name as your famous essay?
Perhaps it means that the only way the students can escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by taking drugs.
That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially dependent on the opium crop.
Do you think crop substitution in the areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight addiction?
Yes, it's one way.
But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.
First we would like to talk to the people concerned and discuss the problem with them.
That is what democracy is all about.
You talk over your problems with the people because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over the world.
Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find other ways of earning a living.
There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma.
Reports describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one needle.
Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.
They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.
The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.
So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.
In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds political, economic and medical.
What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
We are confident that our cause will prevail because that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want.
We all want justice and human rights.
Since what we want will benefit all the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
How much personal danger do you feel?
Have you been threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
(She laughs again.)
But we don't think about that too much.
There's no time to be thinking about such things.
