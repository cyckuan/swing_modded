Releases Annual Anti-drug Certification Report The report says Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay were not certified for cooperating but were granted a national interest waiver while Afghanistan and Burma were denied certification outright.
The two countries were not certified because they "have been world headquarters for the heroin business" for several years, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a briefing at the State Department.
"In Afghanistan, the opium harvest grew substantially, and the Taliban's full complicity in the drug trade has extended to the point where both the harvesting and trafficking of opium is taxed, " Albright told reporters.
The annual certification report has been attacked by the countries listed in the report as the interference into their domestic affairs.
Latin American countries believe the U.S. administration should focus on efforts in reducing the consumption of drugs in the United States.
