World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma.
The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.
An estimated 30 local governments across the United States have passed similar laws.
The legislation is designed to show opposition to Burma's military regime which has been accused of drug trafficking and widespread human rights violations and to encourage it to negotiate a peaceful transition to representative governments.
In a statement to a meeting in Geneva, European Union representatives said the law imposes conditions for suppliers' participation in tendering procedures that violate WTO rules.
In a separate but similar request for a panel to be established, Japanese representatives cited several aspects of the legislation it considers to be inconsistent with WTO regulations.
The United States said in a statement it is disappointed with the decision by the European Union and Japan.
``If this dispute goes to a panel, the U.S. will defend the measure,'' the statement said.
