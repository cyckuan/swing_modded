In the spirit of this philosophy, I present today in my capacity as chairman of the billion-dollar multinational Make a Buck at Any Cost Corp. my special report on American Business Sentiment Toward Burma.
Let's begin with the government's own view of life in this Southeast Asian paradise of more than 47 million people.
In the words of the ruling junta, Burma is one of the most pleasant places created by Mother Nature.
Of course, anti-business fanatics delight in squawking about the occasional tiffs between the people of Burma and their military rulers.
Yes, Rangoon cracked down on protests in 1988, killing thousands to restore order.
Yes, the government ignored results of an election in 1990 clearly indicating that 90 percent of the people rejected its rule and wanted democracy.
And, yes, it placed the elected victor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest.
Yes, many of Suu Kyi's party members have been killed, jailed, or forced into exile.
Yes, the rulers practice torture, turn a blind eye to slavery, and traffick in drugs.
Is this any concern of ours?
As long as imprisonments, torture, slavery, and political repression don't hinder business, let's not get in a huff about it.
These spats will work themselves out.
Are we in business to save the world or make a profit?
Lately, I'm pleased to report, we've seen some progress in silencing the wild-eyed whiners.
Right here in Massashusetts, we finally crushed a radical law late last year that bans state contracts with companies doing business with Burma.
We applaud the clever logic of the National Foreign Trade Council, which took the battle into the courts on behalf of its 580 corporate members.
The judge, in his wisdom, agreed with the council that the state law was unconstitutional.
Of course!
What right does Massachusetts, or any state, have to make its own foreign policy?
But no sooner did we lop off the head of this human rights demon than another beast sprung up in its place.
If only these were the few isolated attacks on us.
But more than two dozen other states and cities are discussing or have already passed laws that target trade with not only Burma but other promising markets like Nigeria, Indonesia, and Cuba.
Already some companies have retreated from Burma on moral grounds.
It breaks my heart.
If a company must withdraw, it is far better to do it proudly for manly businesslike reasons not from any moral squeamishness.
Let us all hail Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant.
It ended operations in Burma last year because of threats of a worldwide consumer boycott.
The company stated in unequivocal terms that its decision was not based on ethics it was, as it should be, purely a commercial move.
