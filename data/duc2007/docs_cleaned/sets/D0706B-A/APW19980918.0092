On the tenth anniversary of the military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.
``We are calling on the military dictators to release all political prisoners, which include elected members of parliament, students, many of whom were recently arrested,'' said Angelay, the spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic Front.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962.
The current military government came to power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement.
``Today is the tenth anniversary of the military takeover.
People in Burma have been suffering for 10 years,'' said Angelay.
The protesters were joined by ten Thai university students and one Canadian activist.
``I'm not aware of any law that prohibits me from taking part in the demonstration.
But I have been warned by the Burmese students that I face possible arrest and deportation,'' said Paul Beaulie, a resident of Quebec.
