Now, evidence is increasing that the Burmese army is using another tool of war against minority populations: rape.
The use of rape as a weapon in ethnic conflict is not uncommon; it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently, Indonesia.
But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention, in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas.
The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops ``continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers.''
According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting ``increasing numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly'' and subjecting them to rape and other abuses.
The Burmese Women's Union alleges that ``women have been raped in an organized and systematic way'' by the army.
The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government.
The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be raped are refugees, internally displaced women, and women belonging to ethnic minorities or the political opposition.
Rapes by the military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.
Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials.
Bolstering those contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's military of ``the savage domination of women outside the scope of acceptable wartime conduct.''
The report also says that ``the violent sexual abuse of ethnic Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic proportions.''
Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.
``It is hardly possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis.
Maybe on an individual basis.
But if it happens, there are laws in place, and people would be punished.''
Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the army.
According to EarthRights, they are given little food, forbidden contact with their families, and forced to beat each other for punishment.
Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have been indoctrinated to believe are ``the people's enemy'' and ``internal destructionists.''
Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the violence against women is directly related to the military's goal of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide against a particular minority.
The document says ``the easiest way to implement these ideas is to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,'' for which it offers a financial reward.
``We must deviously attack those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,'' the document states.
In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the father only.
``Regardless of the source or intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic cleansing policy of the Burmese military,'' he says.
``There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are fueled by the policies expressed in this document.''
Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications between two Burmese military commanders.
Ka Hsaw Wa, a veteran Karen human rights investigator who organizes fact-finding missions for Human Rights Watch, says he encountered the ``Burmanization'' document in the Shan, Karen, and Karenni areas, where his sources retrieved it from Burman soldiers and outposts.
In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of giving rice to the insurgents.
After the assault, they poured boiling water over her.
She died three days later.
In another village, a woman named Naing Mai was raped over five days by military personnel.
She was then burned to death, according to the account that local farmers, who watched from hiding places, later gave Amnesty International.
According to a report last month from the Shan Human Rights Foundation, Aye Nang, another young mother of three, was raped by troops on March 5 in the village of Wan Pek.
She was then stabbed four times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave, uncovered by villagers three days later.
Jennifer Green, staff lawyer with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, is convinced that the Burmese military is guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by the UN war-crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has declared rape a war crime.
``The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that these acts of violence against women are both widespread and systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a certain ethnic group,'' says Green, who is a cocounsel in the lawsuit against Unocal and Total.
``There is a growing acceptance that rape is not just a form of humiliating treatment but is an extreme form of violence and should be regarded as torture.''
