Myanmar has barred British ministers and officials from the country following British pressure on the military regime to hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter the country, also known as Burma.
Last month, Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett called for a European Union mission, including Britain, to visit Myanmar in an attempt to improve human rights in the country, which has been under military rule since 1962.
Britain also discourages companies from putting new investment into Myanmar.
``It will in no way dissuade us from continuing to work for an improvement in the human rights and the political situation in Burma and bringing pressure on the regime to enter into dialogue with democratic leaders.''
Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened.
Her National League for Democracy won the elections, but the military never allowed Parliament to meet.
The EU has already placed sanctions on the Myanmar regime including an arms embargo, putting restrictions on visas and suspending non-humanitarian aid.
``The visa ban is an acknowledgment that the U.K. is at the forefront of international action to bring pressure on the Burmese regime to improve the human rights and political situation in Burma,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said anonymously, in keeping with British practice.
