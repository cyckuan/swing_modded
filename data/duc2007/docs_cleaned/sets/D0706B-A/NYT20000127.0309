The Thai government has yet to ask the United States to accept 1,500 new Burmese student refugees, but a State Department official said Thursday that the United States ``would be willing to consider taking more refugees if there is a need.''
The United States has agreed to resettle 600 of these student refugees from Thailand this year, twice the number who were resettled here last year.
The students fled Burma after the military coup in 1988 and have been refugees in Thailand for more than a decade.
The official said the refugees had no connection to the Burmese guerrilla group that stormed a Thai hospital this week.
