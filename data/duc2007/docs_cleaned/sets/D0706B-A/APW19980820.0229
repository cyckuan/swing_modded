Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
Suu Kyi's health was also ``failing'' according to a statement released Thursday by the National League for Democracy, her political party.
Citing her personal physicians, who have visited her twice in her van outside Yangon, her eyes are turning yellow and she has low blood pressure, the party statement said.
Her doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in her car with three colleagues 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon.
Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months with the military government over her right to travel freely within Myanmar, also known as Burma.
She was stopped outside Yangon last Wednesday by the authorities as she attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet with members of parliament from her party.
The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of parliament and other members of her party imprisoned since May.
There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons, according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile group.
The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear, as Suu Kyi has said in the past that when people are arrested in far flung provinces the party sometimes doesn't hear about it.
There was no immediate response from the military government to Suu Kyi's demand.
In the past, they have never met her calls to release political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
Suu Kyi's offer to end her protest comes one day before her party's deadline for the military to convene parliament.
The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the demand.
``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists no constitution,'' said a government spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
``The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald person to dye his hair.''
Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to be convened.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990 election, but the military refused to honor the results.
After the NLD victory, it denied the election was for a parliament, but instead for delegates to a convention to write a new constitution.
The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on gives the military the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi from holding public office.
The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
In 1988, the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a nationwide democracy uprising.
