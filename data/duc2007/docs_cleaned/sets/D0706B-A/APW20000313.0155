Forced labor, including child labor, are widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights, the U.S. Labor Department said in a report Monday.
The report, required by Congress, updates a 1998 review of labor conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which reached similar conclusions.
Based on findings of the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, the report says forced labor is used to construct roads, dikes, canals and projects to support tourism, military operations and commercial ventures of the military.
''The latest report on labor practices in Burma reinforces our position that the international community must continue to push for a democratic transition in that country,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said in a statement accompanying the report.
