The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators passed quietly Saturday in Myanmar without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of a resolution of the country's deepening problems.
Foreign diplomats and a government official said there were no demonstrations, after warnings from the government and a reported call for calm by the opposition party, the National League for Democracy.
Though the anniversary passed quietly, there could be stepped-up activity in the coming two weeks by the opposition, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
She has set Aug. 21 as the deadline for convening the National Assembly, which was elected eight years ago in a vote that was annulled by the military after her party won 80 percent of its seats.
Since then the military rulers have systematically harassed and imprisoned the elected opposition members and their supporters, and have choked off any attempts at public protest.
Fearing student unrest, authorities have closed the country's universities for almost eight of the past 10 years.
Kent Wiedemann, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, said the opposition was ``clearly taking the initiative at this moment'' in an effort to force some liberalization.
``There's a principle involved: yes, they want to have the election finally recognized,'' Wiedemann said of the Aug. 21 deadline.
But practically speaking, he said, the immediate goal of the opposition is to bring the country's leaders into talks.
The military leaders have said repeatedly that they are only caretakers and that they want to make a transition to democracy.
But their refusal to honor the results of the 1990 election has raised questions about their intentions.
And they have shown no sign of softening.
``As you can see, looking at the events of the last week, the government, rather than heeding the call for dialogue, is instead adopting a more confrontational attitude,'' Wiedemann said.
He referred to stepped-up harassment of the opposition party's elected members of Parliament, the stifling of public protest and the forced return of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to her home on Wednesday after she was halted attempting to visit party members outside Yangon, and in a standoff spent six days in her car.
