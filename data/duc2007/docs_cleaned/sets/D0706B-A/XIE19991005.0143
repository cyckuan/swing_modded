Myanmar Tuesday demanded that the Thai government strictly control refugee camps on the Thai side of the two countries' border.
The demand was made by Colonel Thein Swe, head of the Department of Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry at a press conference here Tuesday afternoon following the peaceful end of the siege of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by Myanmar armed men last Saturday.
He said there are 24 refugee camps along the Myanmar-Thai border where members and their families of different anti-Myanmar government armed groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), Kayin National Union (KNU) and Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) are living and conducting military and "terrorist" training there involving foreigners.
Regarding the seizure of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and the taking of hostages by Myanmar armed men, he stressed that the receiving country should take up the responsibility for the security of an embassy stationed there.
He added that the armed men demanded that the Myanmar government release all political prisoners, recognize the results of the 1990 general election and reshuffle the government.
After a 25-hour tense standoff, the five Myanmar armed men Saturday ended their siege of the Myanmar Embassy and freed all the 38 hostages before they were flown to the Myanmar border in Ratchaburi in the company of Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra.
