dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and advocating the development of democratic practices and institutions.
We do this to prevent conflicts, build prosperity and strengthen the forces of freedom.
But to succeed, we must convince foreign leaders that the common good is good for them as well and that our own agenda is aboveboard.
Obviously, we do not use the same approach with an established modern power that we use with a government whose authority is weak and institutions wobbly.
We consider the domestic pressures that may be affecting a government along with the proclivities and capacities of its leaders.
And in any relationship, we refer constantly back to our basic principles and goals.
For example, there has been much debate about whether we are more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions.
The answer, of course, is that it depends.
Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view of dissent.
Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment ban, against Burma.
Some accuse us of having a double standard.
In reality, we have a single standard based on our assessment of the approach most likely to achieve results that serve U.S. interests and ideals.
In Burma's case, a repressive military regime has rebuffed repeated appeals for talks with the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
Under the junta, Burma has become, with official connivance, the world's leading source of heroin and, with official neglect, the epicenter of a regional AIDS crisis.
Many of its increasingly desperate people are fleeing to neighboring countries.
The democrats, who overwhelmingly won Burma's last free elections, have called for a halt to foreign investment and many categories of aid.
Political change is essential if Burma is to transform itself into a source of stability in Southeast Asia.
Sanctions may well work.
Having driven the economy into the ground, the regime desperately needs foreign investment, loans and aid.
America's stake in China is far deeper and broader than in Burma.
Asian security, nonproliferation and economic health cannot be won without Chinese cooperation.
Our task is to encourage China to become a full and fully constructive participant in the international system.
Our approach is to engage in a dialogue with Chinese leaders while encouraging the broad exchange of information and ideas between American and Chinese citizens.
Unlike Burma, China is changing rapidly.
The government is committed to economic reform.
On proliferation, China has progressed from advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention while agreeing to tighten controls on sensitive exports.
In the political sphere, China has placed a new emphasis on the rule of law, permitted somewhat more open public discussion of political reform, released several prominent dissidents and ratified one international human-rights convention while promising to sign another this fall.
In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur to further openness and change.
Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic and ethnic heritage of Tibet.
Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.
That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly and compellingly to the Chinese people.
It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone will cause democracy in China to blossom.
China's future will be determined by the Chinese.
But our engagement can contribute to an environment in which the Chinese people have more access to information, more contact with the democratic world and less resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.
It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success of our policy toward China or Burma.
In both cases, we hope for progress; in neither do we expect miracles.
Toward these countries and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and persistent.
And we must design our policies not with a cookie cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.
All this argues for flexibility.
There has long been tension between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions, prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on foreign policy.
Having worked in both branches, I know that this tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.
When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from Congress can help to spur action.
What is not helpful is the growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the leverage needed to bargain effectively.
The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of our goals.
Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic.
It requires persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new understandings.
That may entail simple logic, economic incentives, technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing, coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of sanctions or any combination of the above and it may require a different mix of those elements tomorrow than it does today.
To do his job well, the president must be able to pick and choose.
You would not ask a carpenter to build a house with only a hammer.
We should not expect our chief executive to construct a successful foreign policy without a full box of tools.
