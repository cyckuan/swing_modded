Peru, with its resurgent gold industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries, according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to Thailand.
Peru will sharpen its promotional focus among Thai investors during the Second International Gold Symposium in Lima from May 7-10, Maurtua was quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
The symposium will cover all aspects of gold mining, financing and technological processes.
It will be an ideal forum for Thai investors to find out the strong potential Peru offers, he said.
With abundant supplies of gold in Peru, Thai manufacturers could set up joint ventures there to produce jewelry, Maurtua said.
Thais would find even greater opportunities in gold mining, which has proved to be very profitable in recent years, and the recent conclusion of a bilateral agreement for protection of investments gave Thai investors another strong incentive to look at Peru, he said.
The agreement was signed by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan during his visit to Peru in January.
