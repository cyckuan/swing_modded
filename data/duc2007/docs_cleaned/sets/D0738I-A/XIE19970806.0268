Brazil's diamond production picked up last year after a year in recession.
The output totaled 900,000 carats, mining experts said.
Diamond production in 1994 fell to 600,000 carats from the previous year's 1,000,000 carats.
But it grew by 300,000 carats last year, said geologist Paulo Dibeiro de Santana, from the Mining Department.
Brazil's diamond production ranks seventh in the world.
