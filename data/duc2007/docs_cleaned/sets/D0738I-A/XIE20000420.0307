Peru will rank seventh largest gold producer this year, an official from the Mining, Oil and Energy National Society said on Wednesday.
Peru's gold output will amount to 140 tons this year, up ten tons compared with that of last year, said Guillermo Albareda.
The output could sharply grow in a not too long period if the great potential of many gold projects under construction are taken into account, he added.
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
"We are working in long-term investments as hard as we have worked during the last ten years," said Carlos Galvez, president of the Gold Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura company.
In 1999, the exports of gold earned Peru about 1.2 billion dollars.
