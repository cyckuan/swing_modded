Canada's Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation and Gold Fields Limited in South Africa announced their merger plan Tuesday for the creation of the world's third largest gold producer valued at 3.7 billion U.S. dollars.
Under the share-swap plan, shareholders of Johannesburg-based Gold Fields will receive 0.35 share of Franco-Nevada for each Gold Fields common share.
The new company, with its headquarters office to be based in Toronto and the executive office in Johannesburg, will have an annual production of 4.4 million ounces of gold.
Franco-Nevada is the fifth largest gold company in the world, while Gold Fields ranks second among gold producers in South Africa and is one of the largest in the world.
The two companies will call a shareholder meeting in August before an effective merger date is set in September.
