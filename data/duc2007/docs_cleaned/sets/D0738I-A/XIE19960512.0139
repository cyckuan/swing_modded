rich gold seam with estimated reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru.
The U.S. Newmont Mining Corporation and the Peruvian company Buenaventura have been jointly exploiting the Yanacocha gold mine in northwest Peru for the last two years.
Commercial exploitation of the new deposit could start after 1998, a company spokesman said after the completion of infrastructure, including a power generation plant and telecommunications system.
