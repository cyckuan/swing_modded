Peru's gold output this year is expected to grow by 20.5 percent from last year to 92.6 tons, keeping Peru the eighth biggest gold manufacturing country in the world.
The increase in gold output is a result of the effort of entrepreneurs and workers as well as the confidence of national and foreign investors, said Jaime Uranga, chairman of the National Mining, Oil, and Energy Society's Gold Committee.
He said that the country's investment policy on gold mining has been sustained and that some 480 million U.S. dollars have been put in.
The average gold prices dropped from 331.3 dollars per ounce last year to 294.4 dollars per ounce in 1998.
