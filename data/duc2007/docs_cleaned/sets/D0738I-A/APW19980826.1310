The National Guard sprayed tear gas and shot rubber bullets Wednesday at a group of Indians protesting the construction of a high-voltage electricity line in the Amazon jungle.
The Indians said three of their members were hospitalized with injuries, a version denied by the National Guard.
About 350 members of the Pemon tribe in southern Bolivar state occupied the site where crews planned to begin erecting an electricity tower Wednesday.
Within hours, national guardsmen arrived and ``attacked the community,'' said Jose Luis Gonzalez, head of the state's Indigenous Federation.
Gonzalez said the three victims included 13-year-old Orangel Pulido, who he said suffered eye damage when a tear-gas bomb exploded in his face.
Gen. Pedro Zambrano, state leader of the National Guard, told The Associated Press that ``we cannot speak of injuries.''
But he did confirm ``there were some shots of rubber bullets and tear gas bombs were used.''
For the past month, the Pemon tribe has been trying to block the 300-mile (480-kilometer) power line's construction, saying it will damage the environment by supplying electricity to gold mining companies that want to set up operations in the Imataca rain forest.
