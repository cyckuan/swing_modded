Refugees from Guatemala's civil war returned to their homeland from Mexico on Thursday, marking the final chapter of an international effort to resettle them.
United Nations officials called the return of 294 Guatemalans a successful example of resettlement efforts.
With Thursday's return, a total of 41,633 Guatemalans have been helped home.
About 13,000 Guatemalan refugees remain in 60 camps in the southern Mexican state Chiapas.
They will either return individually or stay in Mexico under a nationalization program offered by that country.
The refugees were welcomed with religious services and music Thursday in the town square of Coatepeque, 125 miles west of Guatemala.
They are the last group to be resettled under a U.N.-supervised program in which the Guatemalan government offered them low-interest loans to buy farmland.
Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fled to Mexico and the United States beginning in 1981 amid violence from the country's civil war.
Striking bus drivers blocked streets and many businesses closed their doors Thursday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, in a one-day strike against the government's economic reforms.
About half of the businesses in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of Quito, closed to protest President Jamil Mahuad's proposal to raise taxes to reduce the small South American nation's $1.2 billion budget deficit.
Bus drivers blocked roads with their vehicles to protest the planned gasoline price increase.
Municipal workers demanding a greater share of the nation's budget for cities also joined the strike, placing city trucks and construction equipment across roads to strengthen the blockades.
The protest was largely peaceful.
Guayaquil police reported arresting 25 striking drivers for causing disturbances.
In eight months in office, Mahuad has faced two national strikes and repeated street protests as he tries to reform Ecuador's bankrupt economy and drag it from its worst economic crisis in decades.
Nicaraguan troops surrounded Managua's Sandino International Airport on Thursday to stop reported plans by student protesters to seize the facility and press their demands for higher funding for public universities.
The move came one day after a 21-year-old law student killed by a rubber bullet fired by police Tuesday was buried in an emotional ceremony.
Police officials have warned protesters they might begin using regular ammunition if demonstrators continue to attack public buildings and police lines with rocks and mortars.
Students backed by the leftist Sandinista party have been demonstrating for three weeks to demand that the center-right government of Arnoldo Aleman increase budgets for universities.
The students barricaded access roads to the airport Tuesday and some said they planned to seize it.
Dozens of police officers and students have been injured in the clashes, and 70 protesters have been arrested since the disturbances began.

Ambassador Anne Patterson said the projects are aimed at ``preventing another disaster like the one that occurred during the recent hurricane.''
Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people in Central America and caused billions of dollar in damage in October and November.
Indians clad in loincloths and smeared with warpaint on Thursday protested President Hugo Chavez's failure to halt gold mining in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests.
Chavez, a former coup leader who took office in February, promised during his campaign to reverse a 1997 decree that legalized gold and diamond mining in the pristine Imataca rain forest in southeast Venezuela.
But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
About 60 Indians protested outside Congress Thursday, including two Yanomamis who walked into Congress to present legislators with a letter outlining their complaints.
The Yanomamis are one of the last Stone Age tribes on earth, though their culture has been hurt in recent years by contact with modernity.
