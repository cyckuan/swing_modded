Peru's mining production is expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said today.
Peru's copper output in 1995 was 480,000 tons and its copper export earned 800 million U.S. dollars.
Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and gold export amounted to 600 million dollars last year.
The sources forecast that gold output in Peru, which is rich in mineral resources, will be more than 65 tons in 1996 due to an investment of 26 million dollars in gold projects in the San Jose de Yanacocha and Retamas zones.
