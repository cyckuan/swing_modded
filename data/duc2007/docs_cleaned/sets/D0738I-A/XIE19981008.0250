Argentina will be among the top 20 gold producers in the world, a senior official of the Argentine Ministry of Mines said Wednesday.
Despite the effect of the international economic crisis, Argentina's gold production will increase from 800 kilograms in 1996 to 30 tons in the year 2000, an official of the ministry, Daniel Meilan, said at the "International Gold Seminar Argentina 98," which opened here on Wednesday.
Participants from mining sectors of 14 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Brazil, the United States, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, are scheduled to discuss the international economic crisis and the development of Argentina's mining industry.
Meilan added that from 1996 to 2000, the total investment in Argentina's mining sector would be around 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will help increase gold exports from 32 million to 1.3 billion dollars.
