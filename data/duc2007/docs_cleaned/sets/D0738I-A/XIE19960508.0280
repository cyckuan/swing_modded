Peru turned out 56.4 tons of gold in 1995, representing an increase of 18 percent over the previous year, the Energy and Mining Ministry said today.
Peru is the world's 12th biggest gold producer and second in South America after Brazil.
Gold production will increase by 6.4 percent this year to reach 60 tons, a ministry document said.
For Peru, gold is the third most important export item after copper and fishmeal.
Six of the country's 50 biggest exporting companies are gold mining companies.
Ten years ago, the production of gold in Peru totaled 35 million dollars a year.
It totals 700 million dollars a year right now and is expected to increase to 1.2 billion in the next few years, said the chairman of the gold committee of the National Mining and Petroleum Society.
