Private mines in Chile will have produced 1.9 million metric tons of refined copper in 1996, marking an increase of 41.7 percent over 1995, according to the National Mining Society (SONAMI).
The SONAMI said the dynamic growth this year in the private mining sector had consolidated Chile as the world's leading copper producer.
It said the increasing momentum would become more accentuated in the next three years.
Private mines were estimated to produce 3.2 million metric tons of refined copper, with the total production for the country reaching 4.7 million metric tons.
Output of state-run copper mines would rise to 1.2 million metric tons in 1996, with new mining projects, including El Abra, Refugio, Santa Barbara, Mantoverde, Andacollo-copper and Anacollo-gold, going into operation, the Mining Society said.
