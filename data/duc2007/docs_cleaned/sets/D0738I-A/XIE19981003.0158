Foreign mining firms will maintain investments in Chile of 1.66 billion U.S. dollars this year at the same level as last year.
Director of the Chilean Copper Commission Eduardo Titelman said Friday that these investments would be used in expanding or implementing projects linked to mining of copper, gold, silver and nitrates.
Titelman said total investments including those from the state enterprises in the sector will amount to 2.4 billion dollars this year.
