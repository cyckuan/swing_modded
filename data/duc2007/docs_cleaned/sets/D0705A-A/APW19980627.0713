Thousands of sympathizers of the radical Basque political coalition Herri Batasuna demonstrated Saturday demanding a negotiated solution to the violence in the northern Basque region, news reports said.
Marchers shouted slogans in favor of Basque independence and improved conditions for prisoners from the armed separatist group ETA, a reporter from the El Correo newspaper based in this industrial city said.
Herri Batasuna, considered ETA's political wing, wins about 14 percent in elections held in the northern Basque region.
The demonstration came two days after Manuel Zamarreno, a governing party councilor from the small Basque town of Renteria, was killed by a bomb blamed on ETA.
After Zamarreno's funeral on Friday, thousands demonstrated in silence in the nearby coastal city of San Sebastian to repudiate ETA violence.
While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that ``the repression'' of radical Basque nationalism by the government, ``only lengthens the conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims,'' the national news agency EFE reported.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out negotiations with Herri Batasuana unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA lays down its arms.
The coalition was forced to elect a new leadership in February after its entire 23-member executive board was jailed for using an ETA video calling for peace talks during an election broadcast.
