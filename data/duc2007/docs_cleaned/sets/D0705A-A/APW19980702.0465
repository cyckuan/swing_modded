Spain's Socialist party has pulled out of the three-party Basque regional government because of links between the coalition's principal member and an outside group allied to the armed separatist organization ETA.
The Socialists, the leading opposition party in Spain's national parliament, announced the split accusing the Basque Nationalist Party of getting too close to Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
Most parties in Spain have agreed to isolate Herri Batasuna until it condemns ETA's violence.
On Thursday, Basque regional government chief and Basque Nationalist Party member Antonio Ardanza appointed three new councilors to replace the Socialist representatives who resigned a day earlier.
The split came just under four months before fresh regional elections are held on Oct. 25.
The Basque Nationalist Party won 22 of the 75-seats in the 1994 ballot, has shared power with the Socialists who won 12 and the Basque Union, which won eight.
In recent months the Basque Nationalist Party have promoted attempts to bring Herri Batasuna into the fold so as to encourage a political solution to the region's conflict.
The Basque region, located close to Spain's border with France, is one of 17 semiautonomous regions in Spain.
