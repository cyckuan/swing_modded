As NATO rushes troops and equipment to the Balkans, a powerful ethnic separatist movement is building toward a showdown on the Alliance's own Atlantic flank.
Confronted with unprecedented political opposition and public anger, Spanish rule in Basque country is close to foundering adding a Western European chapter to the breakups that have shattered Yugoslavia and other Eastern European countries since 1990.
For the first time, a unified Basque-nationalist regional government was elected in October, following the declaration of a cease-fire by ETA, the underground separatist army that has waged a bloody 30-year war against Madrid.
The cease-fire was answered by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar with a hard-line crackdown, deeply alienating most voters and ending decades of cooperation between Basque moderates and Spanish political parties.
``There's essentially no contact anymore between our people and the central government,'' says Gorka Agirre, a leader of the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) in Bilbao, the region's largest city.
``Our fathers and grandfathers could only dream of a free Basque land.
My generation believes that we will actually create one,'' says Dabid Lizarralde, 21, a university student in the coastal town of Algorta, 10 miles north of Bilbao, as long-distance runners swept by in a province-wide race organized to support Basque language studies.
The runners, backed by $35 donations for each kilometer, were diverted around the town center to avoid colliding with a parade sponsored by Herri Batasuna, the political arm of ETA.
They passed directly in front of an 8 p.m. demonstration by parents of Basque political prisoners that has occupied Algorta's main intersection every evening for four years.
Portraits of the town's 13 sons and daughters in Spanish prisons were posted in taverns, restaurants and shops.
Greeted by musicians playing Basque folk songs on traditional instruments, crowds of people poured out of the local railroad station from yet other demonstrations in Bilbao, including a silent protest march that blocks the city's principal thoroughfare each Friday.
Basque country in 1999 recalls Prague or Budapest a decade ago, when endless demonstrations and a sense of history-in-the-making brought ordinary life to a giddy standstill.
There are echoes, too, of the violent Kurdish separatist war that has killed thousands in Turkey, and of stubborn ethnic nationalist movements that have troubled other NATO governments during the past few years in Scotland and Wales, Corsica, northern Italy, Flemish Belgium and Quebec.
Basque nationalists follow all of these movements closely, and maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with several, in what amounts to a de facto alliance of ``stateless nations'' inside NATO that stretches from the British Isles to the Aegean Sea.
The new regional government has invited the outlawed Kurdish parliament to convene in Bilbao in July, and it protested the sales of arms manufactured by Spanish firms in Basque country to the Turkish government.
Madrid has officially prohibited the convention, setting the stage for a confrontation over Basque ties to the Kurds.
But the closest kinship is with Ireland, where the very institutions and tactics of separatist rebellion are cut from the same cloth and where the connection has a six-decade history, speaks in the lilting brogue of Dublin and has a Basque family name: Gallastegi.
Now an energetic 73, Iker Gallastegi arrived in Ireland in September 1937 at age 10 with his parents and five siblings.
It was the height of the Spanish Civil War, and Basque country was in flames.
Eli Gallastegi, Iker's father, was a leading Basque nationalist, singled out for liquidation by General Francisco Franco's Fascists when the family fled Spain.
Dublin was already his second home.
Inspired by the stubborn Irish fight for independence, the elder Gallastegi had written a history of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule, and in 1932 founded a trading firm in Bilbao to import eggs, potatoes and pork from the young Irish Free State.
In their Dublin exile, the Gallastegi children were raised on an uncompromising mixture of Basque separatism and Irish republicanism.
Eventually, that education led Iker himself to return to Basque country as a young nationalist organizer in 1952 under an assumed name, and to flee once again just ahead of Franco's police.
``It was 17 years before I was able to return home, after Franco was dead.''
The rebellious family tradition has carried into the next generation.
Gallastegi's daughter Usune, 35, has been in a Spanish prison since 1994, sentenced to an eight-year term for ``collaborating with terrorists.''
The exchanges between Ireland and Basque country that began with the Gallastegis continue at a brisk clip today.
``We're not married, but you could surely say that we are living together,'' says Gallastegi.
The result is a set of matched political structures that frame, in tandem, Western Europe's two oldest ethnic nationalist movements.
The relationships between the underground ETA and Herri Batasuna and major elements in their strategy, training and recruitment methods are mirror images of the relationship between Sinn Fein, the militant but legal Irish political party, and its own armed wing, the Irish Republican Army.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has made at least half a dozen visits to Bilbao, according to Herri Batasuna officials, and other high-ranking members of the two parties consult regularly on tactics.
During several assignments in and around Belfast in recent years, a Chronicle reporter encountered visiting groups of militants from Jarrai, the Herri Batasuna youth organization, boisterously participating in Republican political demonstrations.
So boisterously, in fact, that republican leaders were obliged to restrain the young Basques, who in one instance tried to lead a headlong charge against police lines.
Spanish police charge that these visits include military field training under IRA supervision, and they allege that Jarrai is behind a spate of firebombings directed at officials of Aznar's conservative People's Party in Basque country.
``Obviously, the ties extend to a working relationship between ETA and IRA on some level.
There's a tremendous amount of traffic back and forth between Bilbao and Belfast,'' acknowledges a Basque leader, speaking off the record.
``But that's not something to be discussed publicly.''
As in Northern Ireland, where the Royal Ulster Constabulary is effectively a Protestant police force, Basques face a law enforcement agency Spain's Guardia Civil that employs virtually no members of its own community.
In yet another echo of Irish Republican tactics, Herri Batasuna has compiled lengthy lists of unmarked police car license plate numbers and has posted them in popular taverns run by the party in nearly every Basque town and village.
Like its significant other in Ireland, Herri Batasuna ran candidates in regional elections for three decades, only to decline the seats it won in protest against ``foreign rule.''
Then, last year, the IRA declared a permanent cease-fire, and Sinn Fein sat down at the negotiating table with its adversaries.
Within weeks, ETA and Herri Batasuna followed suit.
The result was a dramatic September meeting in the city of Lizarra, 70 miles south of Bilbao, at which all nine nationalist political parties and 14 Basque labor and cultural organizations issued a joint declaration calling for multiparty negotiations toward self-rule.
``Before Lizarra, the football field had always been the Spanish state,'' says Eusebio Lasa, a member of Herri Batasuna's national council.
``What we decided at Lizarra is that the field must be Basque country itself that the future should be up to the Basque people and not simply concessions from officials in Madrid.''
Modeled consciously on the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, the Lizarra Declaration set the stage for the election, one month later, that ushered in the unprecedented nationalist-run regional government.
Between them, the moderate PNV, Herri Batasuna and a third nationalist party now hold 41 seats in the regional parliament, against 30 for the People's Party (PP) and the Socialists.
``The situation has changed enormously,'' says Gorka Agirre of the PNV, which leads the new governing coalition, the first in history not to include either the Socialist Party or the PP.
``We agree now (with Herri Batasuna) that there was no great difference between those two parties when it came to Basques.
Neither was interested in talking about a different future here, about any real self-determination,'' he says.
According to the Spanish constitution, even a referendum on self-determination in Basque country remains strictly against the law.
This is where the Irish experience no longer fits the Basque reality.
The Good Friday Agreement was reached under the auspices of a British government desperate to extricate itself from the Northern Ireland quagmire, and more than happy to have the end game played in Belfast rather than London.
The problems since in implementing self-rule in Northern Ireland have not come from 10 Downing Street, but from die-hard factions within the unionist and republican camps.
By contrast, there is no war in Basque country between communities, no exchange of atrocities between Bilbao versions of the Catholic and Protestant gunmen who haunt Belfast.
``The enemy isn't the Spanish lad next door,'' says Gallastegi.
``It's the national state,'' in the form of a central government that responded to the historic cease-fire by arresting the very people with whom it must negotiate.
``When I arrived in power, I said, `I will never talk with ETA.'
If there is no peace, ETA and ETA alone will be responsible,'' says Aznar, pointing out that ETA has been responsible for more than 800 killings in the past three decades, mostly of government officials.
``Where there is peace, there is discussion.
Without discussion, there is no place for peace,'' counters the Rev.
Pierre Moleres, bishop of the predominantly Basque city of Bayonne in France.
Moleres' offer to help arrange negotiations was rejected by the Aznar government, which opposes any international mediation in the crisis.
The crackdown began just as Basque nationalists were laying the groundwork for the cease-fire in October 1997, when the entire 23-member leadership council of Herri Batasuna was sentenced to lengthy jail terms for distributing a video that presented ETA's terms for peace.
According to many observers, the imprisoned council members were the most negotiation-minded of the organization's factions to hold sway in years.
They join more than 500 Basque political activists now in prison.
Since then, ETA militants have been found dead, under suspicious circumstances that recall the work of secret assassination squads in the 1980s that were linked to the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez.
In late April, under pressure from Madrid, French police rounded up six more nationalist leaders in Paris.
Gallastegi's niece Irantzu, a key figure in the ETA bid for peace, was one of those arrested.
``Every effort we've made to search an accord with Aznar, to promote dialogue, has been negative,'' says PNV's Agirre.
``Me, I want peace,'' Aznar insists.
``But they are trying to obtain independence.
That's the difference between us.''
