former leader of the Basque separatist group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace talks.
``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region, this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group.
He was let out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct. 25.
Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
The government has responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way for talks.
In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in hospitals of their choice.
