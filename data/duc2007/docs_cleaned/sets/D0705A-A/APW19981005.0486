The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's Basque conflict and the international community, particularly the United States, has a duty to help bring this about, Irish republican leader Gerry Adams said Monday.
``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United States is the most powerful,'' Adams, who heads the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party, told a press conference shortly after arriving in this northern Basque town.
``We would be calling on the international community to assist in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country where an initiative has been taken,'' said Adams.
Adams was greeted at the start of his half-day stay by some 100 Basque independence supporters waving Irish and Basque flags.
The Irish leader was expected to be handed a proposal for all-party peace talks signed by Basque nationalist parties grouped together in the so-called ``Irish Forum.''
The forum is hopeful Adams will pass its proposal on to President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month.
Adams described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as ``crucial and pivotal.''
On Sept 18, ETA began an indefinite and condition-free cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern France.
The organization, whose name is an acronym in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
The Spanish government has long ruled out ETA's demand for a self-determination vote for Basques.
The Irish Forum claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland peace process and its success in opening the door for a political settlement in the troubled British province.
Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams whose Sinn Fein party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party allied to ETA called on the Spanish government to put aside its ``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a peace process be set in motion.
During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell on the outskirts of Bilbao.
Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen called for peace talks.
Today, however, most people believe an armed campaign for independence cannot be justified given the level of self-government the Basque region enjoys since democracy returned in 1978.
Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday.
