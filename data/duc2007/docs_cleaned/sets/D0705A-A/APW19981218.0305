Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group ETA.
The announcement by the Interior Ministry came exactly three months after ETA began observing an open-ended ceasefire in its 30-year battle for an independent homeland.
Since then, the government has been under pressure from both hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred to the Basque country, or at least closer to it.
In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners to the Basque country itself.
Officials insisted this was for humanitarian reasons only.
The government keeps more than 500 ETA prisoners scattered around the country to avoid their plotting behind bars.
The interior ministry said 21 will be moved to jails in the south of the mainland from prisons in the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the northern coast of Morocco.
The ministry said the transfers would begin immediately.
It named the prisoners but did not list their crimes.
In November, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he had authorized exploratory talks with parties close to ETA to determine whether the group was prepared to renounce violence for good.
Aznar insists that the peace process cannot advance in earnest without a permanent end to the violence.
And even so, he says the government is only willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other issues involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of independence.
The group, whose name means Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for a separate homeland in the Basque country, an area which straddles parts of northern Spain and southern France.
