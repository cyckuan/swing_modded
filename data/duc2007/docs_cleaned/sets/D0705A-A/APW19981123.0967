Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga arrived here Monday for a four-day visit which he said was aimed at getting a firsthand view of the peace process in Spain's Basque region, news reports said.
Skirting questions as to the possibility of him mediating in resolving the Basque problem, Cossiga told reporters he was ``here as a friend'' and had been invited to the northern Spanish region by the governing Basque Nationalist Party.
His visit comes as Spain and the three-province Basque region enjoys its third month of peace following the Sept. 18 cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA.
On Monday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Cossiga ``could come and go'' in Spain as often as he likes but stressed that no intermediaries were needed to resolve the Basque conflict, the private Europa Press news agency said.
The Italian centrist leader praised center-right Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's decision to begin making contacts to sound out ETA's long-term intentions before full negotiations take place.
Cossiga added that peace in the Basque region would help consolidate the European Union.
During the visit, Cossiga is to hold talks with Basque Nationalist Party leaders and visit the several political and cultural sites.
He did not rule out a meeting with representatives of Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
