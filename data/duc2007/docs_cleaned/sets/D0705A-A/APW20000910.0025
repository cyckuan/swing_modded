bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque separatists.
Nobody was hurt in the explosion shortly before 11 a.m., but police said the bomb caused extensive damage to the Txitxarro discotheque in the town of Deba, some 15 miles west of coastal city of San Sebastian.
Basque police said a man identifying himself as a member of the Basque armed group ETA warned of an imminent explosion at the disco.
The anonymous caller also said that two people who were cleaning inside the discotheque had been left handcuffed to a tree in the road of Itziar toward Hendaya.
The two confirmed that there were no other people inside the discotheque at the time of the explosion, which mainly damaged the building's roof.
The mayor of Deba, Jesus Maria Aguirrezabala, said that the target of the blast was the owner of the disco, Narciso Korta, who is a brother of a businessmen killed in a car bomb in August.
It has been blamed for about a dozen killings this year since it ended a 14-month truce last December.
Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA started its campaign for independence 30 years ago.
Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque provinces in the north.
It envisions an independent state that would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural identity and language.
For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle for sovereignty.
But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals, pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.
