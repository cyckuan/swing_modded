group of Spanish political parties will meet here next week to mobilize against the Basque separatist group ETA, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said today.
The July 10 meeting is aimed at "uniting all democratic forces in the struggle against terrorism," Mayor Oreja said.
Participating in the meeting will be those who adopted in 1987 a common stance in fighting the terrorist war launched by the ETA, and have since formed a political alliance.
The national alliance has been allying with its regional counterpart in Basque, in northern Spain, to quell the ETA, namely the Basque Homeland and Freedom.
The meeting, which came on after the ETA's week-long unilateral truce ended Monday, was expected to strengthen the links between the national and regional anti-terrorism alliances.
The Herri Batasuna party, the ETA's political wing, will be excluded from the meeting.
The ETA has been fighting for a separate Basque state for 27 years.
About 750 people were killed in the pro-independence war.
