The armed Basque separatist movement ETA accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the Basque language.
The charge came in a statement published in a radical newspaper, Euskadi Informacion.
In the Basque language, known as Euskera, Euskadi is the word for the Basque country, a region straddling the border between Spain and France.
It said the governments and Spain and France were trying to ``close off the language and force it into a ghetto to be eliminated little by little.''
``France and Spain are maintaining their imperialism,'' the statement said.
Euskadi Informacion is a makeshift publication that surfaced after the daily Egin was shut down in July over its alleged links to ETA.
An estimated 600,000 people speak Euskera in the seven Basque provinces in Spain and France, according to the University of the Basque Country, in San Sebastian.
It was among regional languages that were officially banned under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975.
