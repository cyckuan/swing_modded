Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is considering paying damages to relatives of people killed by government-backed death squads that targeted Basque separatists in the 1980s when his Socialist predecessors were in power, a spokesman said Wednesday.
``This is a subject that is being analyzed now.
That is all there is to say,'' spokesman Josep Pique told reporters.
The death squads, which called themselves the Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, killed 27 people from 1983 to 1987 in a campaign designed to crush the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
Jose Barrionuevo, interior minister under then-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, and his deputy for state security, Rafael Vera, are serving 10-year jail terms for their role in organizing a botched 1983 kidnapping that marked the GAL's first act.
Pique also rejected a call Tuesday by ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, for a blanket amnesty for more than 500 jailed ETA members as a way to end decades of separatist conflict.
He reiterated the government position that if ETA, which declared a ceasefire Sept. 16, renounces violence for good, officials are willing to consider transferring some ETA prisoners to jails in or near the Basque country in line with a long-standing ETA demand.
Pique also said the government is ``still waiting'' for a response from ETA to Aznar's offer of exploratory talks to discuss whether the group is willing to renounce violence.
The government insists that if full-blown peace talks do get underway, it is prepared to discuss only the prisoner issue and ETA disarmament, not ETA's stated goal of an independent Basque homeland.
Its bombings and shootings in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain have left nearly 800 people dead since 1968.
