The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in possible peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA, an official said Tuesday.
The government will only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners, government spokesman Josep Pique said.
``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,'' Pique told reporters in Barcelona.
The group began observing an open-ended cease-fire on Sept. 18.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said last week his government is willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA.
The purpose of these discussions would be for the group to confirm it really wants peace, the government said.
