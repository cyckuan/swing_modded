The armed Basque separatist group ETA chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical Basque newspaper Elgin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the slayings and several other recent attacks.
Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth slayings attributed to ETA this year.
It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Egin.
Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for independence.
