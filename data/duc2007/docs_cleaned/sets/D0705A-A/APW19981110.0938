The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
Spokesman Josep Pique said the government would only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners in jails around Spain.
``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,'' Pique told reporters in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
``No one should think there is going to be any kind of political negotiation on the basis of what might arise when the violence ends,'' he added.
Pique was speaking a day after a senior official from the opposition Socialist party warned that ETA, which began observing an open-ended ceasefire on Sept. 18, was attempting to force full-blown talks on the future of the Basque country as its price for renouncing violence for good.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, flush with a strong showing by his center-right Popular Party in Basque regional elections on Oct. 25, said last Tuesday his government is willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA.
The purpose of these discussions, the government said, would be for ETA to confirm that it really wants peace.
Two days later ETA issued a statement that fell short of promising a permanent end to violence.
The document was dated before Aznar's offer.
In it ETA supported a Basque nationalist peace proposal that calls for a two-track process made up of negotiations between the government and ETA, on issues like weapons and prisoners, and separate all-party talks on the future of the Basque country.
These latter discussions would touch on ETA's stated goal of independence, according to this blueprint signed by a broad range of nationalist Basque parties and known as the Lizarra Declaration after a town in Spain's northern Basque region.
Pique's remarks ruling out talks on independence come as both sides jockey to shape a peace-talks agenda that suits them best, with the government seeking to keep it as narrow as possible, while ETA is trying to push it open.
