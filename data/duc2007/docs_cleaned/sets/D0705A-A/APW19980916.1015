It's election time in Spain's troubled Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of attempts to end three decades of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by ETA rebels fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
Basque nationalists this week urged ETA, one of Europe's few remaining armed political groups, to renounce bloodshed so that a political solution can be found.
Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups, including radical ETA-linked political party Herri Batasuna, took a joint position on the issue.
Their so-called Lizarra Declaration calls for peace talks and a permanent end to the violence.
But when asked Wednesday about the possibility of an ETA cease-fire, Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said, ``It would be a trick truce.''
The group has killed 800 people since it took up arms 30 years ago, and was extremely active during the Socialist administration of ex-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the early 1980s, killing dozens of police officers every year.
Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged the rebels to stop the killing.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces violence.
The Lizarra Declaration came out of a forum promoted by Herri Batasuna and held in the Basque city of Lizarra.
It was signed by representatives of 23 political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups.
It ended with a series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the government refused to negotiate unless ETA renounced violence.
