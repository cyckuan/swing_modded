gang of hooded youths who support Basque separatism pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at a street fair in Bilbao, leaving 17 people injured, authorities said Saturday.
Two of the injured were in serious condition.
The 30-minute melee occurred outside the town hall as an estimated 100 youths set upon members of the Basque regional government's police force.
Police reported two arrests a 19-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
The latter was one of the two people seriously injured, suffering burns when an incendiary device went off in her hands.
The girl was placed under arrest after she was hospitalized.
The other serious injury was a middle-aged man who was attacked for yelling at the youths who assaulted police.
Overall, 17 people were injured, including five policemen, Europa Press reported.
Similar violence rocked another Basque town, Getxo, last Saturday as youths with Molotov cocktails burned down a three-story apartment building.
Its residents were evacuated in time and no injuries were reported.
After that incident, Herri Batasuna, the political party linked to the armed separatist group ETA, said for the first time that the party opposed street violence as a way to further the Basque separatist cause.
