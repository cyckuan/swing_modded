The chief of the Basque militant group ETA, Ignacio Gracia Arregui, was arrested Friday evening by French security force in southwest France, a media report said Saturday.
Arregui, also known as "Inaki de Renteria", was arrested when he was with his wife in an apartment in the village of Bidart in the French Basque country.
The arrest came as ETA was launching an intensive campaign of attacks against the Spanish authorities.
Born in 1955 in Renteria, Spanish Basque country, Arregui is the highest leader of ETA and leader of its military wing since 1992, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.
He was believed to be the mastermind of the abortive assassination plot in 1995 against King Juan Carlos in the island of Palma de Majorque.
