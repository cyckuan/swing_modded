Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that the week-long unilateral cease-fire started today by the militant Basque separatist group Eta is a propaganda stunt.
The cease-fire, said the prime minister, was designed to disrupt a upcoming meeting of Basque parties opposed to Eta, which over the past 27 years has killed more than 750 people.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Javier Mayor Oreja called on the Eta, which has fought for a separate Basque state made up of four northern Spanish provinces and three southwestern French departments, to release prison officer Jose Ortega Lara it has held for five months.
He urged the parties attending the Tuesday meeting to concentrate on uniting against the Eta and not squabble over the response to the cease-fire.
Carlos Iturgay, the Popular Party spokesman in the Basque country, said talks with the Eta should not be considered.
The opposition Spanish Socialist Workers Party said the week-long cease-fire was insufficient and that the Eta would have to offer more before negotiations could be considered.
The Basque regional government, which is led by the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, said the cease-fire provided a reason for hope but called on the Eta to give up its arms altogether.
The Eta has said it will hold Ortega Lara until the government changes its policy of placing Eta prisoners in jails outside the Basque Country.
Some 30 of the 600 Eta members in Spanish prisons are due to be moved to the Basque country in coming weeks.
