The armed Basque separatist group ETA has announced an open-ended cease-fire, a newspaper reported late Wednesday.
The radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion said it had received a statement from ETA in which the separatist group announced a truce in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in the north of Spain, the state-run news agency EFE reported.
