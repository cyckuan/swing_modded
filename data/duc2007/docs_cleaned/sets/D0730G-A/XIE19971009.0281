President Bill Clinton today signed a 247.7 billion U.S. dollar military spending bill for the 1998 fiscal year starting October 1.
Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item veto power.
The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding than was approved for the previous year.
It cuts off funding for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says the bill in a cautious language.
The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed "concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto authority to shrink the bill.
"The bill provides 4.2 billion dollars more than I requested in my 1998 budget, and 1.2 billion dollars more than the levels that my administration believes were agreed to in the bipartisan budget agreement" between Congress and the White House, Clinton said.
Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as to how much Clinton would target in a veto.
On Monday, Clinton used the law to veto 38 spending items in a military construction bill.
The "could-be" vetoed spending items include half a billion dollars in congressionally added spending on eight C-130J military transport aircraft not in either the Pentagon's budget request or in the request Clinton sent to Capitol Hill.
The planes are built in Marietta, Georgia, hometown of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Congress also added 100 million dollars for an LPD-17 amphibious assault ship, to be built near the hometown of Representative Bob Livingston, Republican from Louisiana and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and 720 million dollars for an Aegis destroyer built in the hometown of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from Mississippi.
