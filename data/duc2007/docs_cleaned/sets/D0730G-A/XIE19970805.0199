President Bill Clinton said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to be used "somewhat sparingly."
Clinton is expected to sign the budget and tax-cut bills on Tuesday.
After signing them, he has five days to decide whether to cut out individual items.
Voicing his support for the line-item veto, Clinton told reporters during a photo session, "I think if we have it, it ought to be used.
Before the new law was passed last year, the only way presidents could reject spending laws was to veto whole budget bills.
Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
He said his aides were still reviewing the tax and budget bills to determine which items were open to the line-item veto, or whether any of them should be stricken.
Last week, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said he doubted Clinton would veto specific items, saying that to do so would violate the spirit of the bipartisan negotiations between the White House and the Congress.
