President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144 million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending bill.
Clinton vetoed 13 relatively obscure research and spending programs, almost all the military spending increases approved by Congress.
The new vetoes came weeks after he vetoed 287 million dollars from a separate 9.2 billion dollars military construction bill.
The cuts included 39 million dollars that would have kept the remaining three SR-71 Blackbird spy planes flying.
Pentagon said that the SR-71 was no longer needed because of the capabilities of spy satellites, improved U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned robot planes.
Other cuts included 30 million dollars that would have financed research on tracking and intercepting asteroids before they collide with earth, 3 million dollars for microsurgery research and 3 million dollars for an underwater noisemaking device.
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as being affected compared to two Democrat.
Lawmakers added 750 projects to the defense appropriations bill that were not in Clinton's original defense spending plan.
All but 13 of those survived the line-item veto.

Some lawmakers now threatened to consider repealing the line-item veto law, passed only last year as a budget-balancing measure.
