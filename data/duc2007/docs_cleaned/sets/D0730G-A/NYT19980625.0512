Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding disagreement between the state and federal government over the legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state, city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with potentially devastating consequences for patient care and government budgets.
``I'm very gratified we won this because I realized the impact this would have had, not only on the city, but in particular on the ability of hospitals to care for those people who are the weakest and in the most vulnerable positions, people without medical insurance,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
The city, where most of the state's Medicaid recipients live, was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto, along with hospital groups and unions for health care workers.
At issue were taxes New York state has levied on hospitals for many years to finance health care programs for the poor, including health insurance for children in low-income families, AIDS services and poison control centers.
Under Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor, Washington matched much of the revenue raised by those taxes.
But in 1995, the Clinton administration raised concerns about whether some of the taxes were legal under a 1991 federal law intended to prevent Medicaid abuses by states.
New York requested a waiver from the 1991 law, but after much haggling, the administration declined to grant one.
Frustrated with the stalemate and concerned that the administration would eventually demand repayment of some of the federal matching funds, New York state officials and city hospital officials asked New York's senators, Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to insert language in a 1997 budget bill declaring the taxes legal and absolving the state of responsibility for repaying any of the Medicaid matching funds.
The senators complied and the measure was approved by Congress.
At the same time, White House officials were searching for budget provisions that would be appropriate for Clinton's inaugural use of the line-item veto.
Last August, the president selected three, one of which was the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment, contending that the measure would set a damaging precedent.
The veto almost immediately became a political headache for the administration, as New York Democrats joined labor unions, hospital officials, advocates for the poor and Republicans in assailing the president for jeopardizing programs for the indigent.
Yet it was never really clear that the administration was on the verge of declaring the state's hospital taxes illegal.
And even had it done that, many federal officials said, it would have been unlikely for the administration to demand that the state, with its large pool of Democratic voters, or its hospitals reimburse any of the Medicaid funds.
Still, hospital officials declared Thursday that the Supreme Court had rescued New York's hospital system from a potential disaster.
``If we had to pay this money back, it would have come at inducing a crisis in the health care system,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a hospital trade group.
