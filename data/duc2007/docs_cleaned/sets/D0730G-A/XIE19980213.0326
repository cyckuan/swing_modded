The Justice Department is planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to small numbers of people.
Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate to override.
In his Thursday ruling, U.S. Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers among the three branches of government.
The White House later worked out an agreement giving New York much of the money.
The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers, who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in its first full year.
In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
