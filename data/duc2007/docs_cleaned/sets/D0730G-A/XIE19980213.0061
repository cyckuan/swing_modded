district judge Thursday declared the president's line-item veto authority unconstitutional.
However, Hogan's ruling will likely not be the final word in the case.
The issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court.
The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.
Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, "It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court."
The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire measure.
Hogan ruled that Congress may not "delegate its inherent lawmaking authority."
New York City maintains it was unfairly targeted by Clinton when he canceled a section of the federal budget bill that would have let the city and state raise taxes on hospitals and pass those charges along to the federal government in the form of Medicaid billings.
