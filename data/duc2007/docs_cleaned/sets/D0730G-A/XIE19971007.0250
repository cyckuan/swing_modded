President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto power to strike out 38 projects worth 287 million U.S. dollars from a military construction bill.
"Government must continue to live within its means," Clinton said in cutting the military outlays from the 9.2 billion U.S. dollar bill.
The vetoed projects include a 19.9 million dollar plan to build a new wharf for ship repair at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia; a 17.9 million dollar pier improvement project at Florida's Mayport Naval Station; a 16 million dollar railroad project at Fort Carson, Colo.; four projects in California and three in Texas.
Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of specific congressmen and senators.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state was spared, although six Mississippi projects were added to the military construction bill.
Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, home state of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will lose a 6.8 million dollar combat search and training center if the president's veto is upheld.
The line-item veto, sought by U.S. presidents for more than a century, gives the president the ability to cancel special interest tax breaks as well as specific spending items that he deems wasteful while avoiding killing the entire measure.
It was only the second time Clinton had exercised the line-item veto authority, which went into effect in January.
