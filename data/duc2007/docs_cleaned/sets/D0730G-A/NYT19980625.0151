The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a constitutional amendment, the justices said.
In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures.''
Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government.
Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
