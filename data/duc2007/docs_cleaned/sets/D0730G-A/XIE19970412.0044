President Bill Clinton said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress.
Clinton said that he was "disappointed."
"We ought to give the Supreme Court a chance to have their say on it."
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal spending and the balance of power in government.
The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress.
Previously, the president could only veto entire bills.
