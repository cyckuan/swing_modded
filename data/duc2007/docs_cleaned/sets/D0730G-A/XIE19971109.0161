The United States House of Representatives today voted 352-64 to reject President Bill Clinton's line-item veto of 38 military construction programs in fiscal 1998.
The Senate also voted 69-30 last month to restore funding for 36 of the 38 projects.
Both the votes were well above the two-thirds needed to overturn a presidential veto.
But it was unclear whether the two chambers can come up with a unified bill before they recess for the year, possibly on Sunday.
Last year, Clinton gained the line-item veto power to veto individual spending items in bills while signing the bills to ensure the administration moving in a new fiscal year.
Last month, the president exercised his new authority by killing 38 military construction projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars.
So far the White House has vetoed 163 line-items against six bills, mostly affecting military projects.
The White House said that the president used his authority to cancel projects that were not requested in the budget and would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members.
The House today also completed work on seven other bills to finish its work and leave for its year-end recess Sunday.
It passed by voice vote the Reading Excellence Act, which authorizes 260 million dollars over three years to help teachers, tutors and parents to learn how to teach children reading.
It also passed by a vote of 291-125 legislation to authorize agricultural research and education programs through 2002.
