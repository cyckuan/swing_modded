The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress.
Instead the court found that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of Article I.
That clause establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.
It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional defect.
The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress.
That issue, however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurring opinion.
``By increasing the power of the president beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to secure.''
In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the National Endowment for the Arts.
The law in question ordered the NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making grants.
Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an advisory opinion.''
In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of causing offense in any quarter.''
Some of the justices who joined the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect the NEA from further congressional attacks.
But in all likelihood this ruling will simply embolden enemies of government funding for the arts.
