The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures.
Thursday's 6-3 decision said the law violates a stipulation in the U.S. Constitution that requires every bill passed by the Congress to be presented to the president for his signature of approval or veto.
The court said the constitutional language does not allow what in effect would be partial vetoes.
The justices said that type of line-item veto could be authorized only by amending the Constitution, an arduous process done only 27 times in the document's 211-year history.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by almost every president this century as a tool to limit wasteful politically based spending by Congress.
Congress enacted the veto in 1996, and Clinton used it 82 times last year.
