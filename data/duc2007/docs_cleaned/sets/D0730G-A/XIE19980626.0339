The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures.
The high court's 6-3 decision said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after provisions they sought were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, the authority sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority, and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
The line-item veto law let the president sign a bill and within five days go back to reject specific spending items or tax breaks in it.
Congress then could reinstate the item by passing a separate bill.
Once the president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not be the same as the measure approved by Congress.
The Clinton administration contended a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law, but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
The Supreme Court said the administration and the veto law's backers in Congress were wrong.
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that "the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution."
In ruling the line-item veto law unconstitutional last February, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said it amounted to a surrender by Congress of an "inherently legislative function" to the president.
Once a bill becomes law, the president's sole duty is to carry it out, the judge said.
The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld that ruling.
