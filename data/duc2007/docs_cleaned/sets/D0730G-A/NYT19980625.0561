The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks.
But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' Clinton said.
``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds.''
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' Kennedy declared.
``Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design.''
The Line Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' ``Contract With America.''
Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House members voted for it.
Presidents since Ulysses Grant have sought the line-item veto, and Ronald Reagan popularized the idea.
Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
The dissenters Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor would have upheld the line-item veto.
Scalia said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.
In addition to Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority opinion by Stevens in the case, Clinton vs. City of New York, No.
