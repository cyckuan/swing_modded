President Bill Clinton today vetoed a congressional rejection of his line-item veto on 38 military construction projects.
Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill.
Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families."
Then the Senate voted to disapprove of Clinton's veto of 36 of the projects and the House voted to restore all the 38.
As a congressional version to kick the ball back to the president, the Senate then agreed with the House to fully restore the projects.
The Republican-dominated congress will not let the matter over.
It can still override his veto with two-thirds votes in the House and Senate when it resumes session next year.
