The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old attempt mostly by Congressional Republican leaders to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
The Supreme Court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The president has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many states, would help eliminate the budget deficit.
But the court said Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' he said.
``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds.''
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money that would have gone to New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Challenges to those vetoes led to Thursday's decision.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' he declared.
``Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design.''
The Line-Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' Contract With America.
Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House members voted for it.
Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying they would have upheld the line-item veto.
Scalia said ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.
Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and Daniel Coats of Indiana, both Republicans, said they would keep fighting for it.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto.
Under this arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each year.
Stevens said the Line-Item Veto Act ``gives the president the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.''
In exercising the power, President Clinton has infuriated members of Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.
Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining that Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states.
In February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military construction projects worth $287 million.
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the line-item veto, was ecstatic after the ruling.
``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said.
``Today we feel that the liberties of the American people have been assured.
God save this honorable Court!''
Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years, expressed dismay at Breyer's opinion.
Advocating a pragmatic view of the Constitution, Breyer said the line-item veto was an acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of individual citizens.''
Byrd said this was ``a remarkable position to take.''
He quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men.
And wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.''
Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton had used the device.
In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury.''
On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury.''
Justice Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority opinion by Justice Stevens in the case, Clinton vs. City of New York, No.
