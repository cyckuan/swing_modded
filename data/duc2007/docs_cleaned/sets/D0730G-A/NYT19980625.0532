The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen. John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the president expanded veto power to harness ``pork-barrel'' spending by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court declared unconstitutional a McCain-sponsored law giving the president authority to wipe out wasteful programs contained in larger spending bills.
Before the law's enactment in 1996, the president could veto an entire spending measure but not individual items.
The court ruled that such a specialized veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
But McCain, R-Ariz., and other line-item veto backers, vowed to push instead for a slightly different measure in Congress that, this time, would pass constitutional muster.
Several senators feared the court's ruling would usher in a new era of the sort of bloated, special-interest spending that Congress was long known for such projects as microbreweries, boat marinas and other ``pork.''
``This defeat means that we will return and retreat to the practice of loading up otherwise necessary legislation with pork-barrel spending,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.
``The Supreme court has resurrected a pig, or pork, that we thought was dead.''
The court's decision was a defeat for McCain, who forced a vote on a line-item veto nearly every year for a decade until its approval two years ago.
``I'd like to point out that it's been a wonderful two weeks for me,'' a droll McCain told reporters after the decision.
McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, lost his bid to pass a sweeping anti-tobacco bill last week and was criticized for telling a crude joke at a fund-raiser about the president's daughter.
Passage of the line-item veto by the Senate after so many failures had been considered one of the crowning achievements of McCain's career.
House Republicans made the line-item veto a part of their Contract with America, the agenda they credited for electing a GOP majority to Congress in 1994.
But the court said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
The court said the Constitution does not allow for what, in effect, are partial vetoes.
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the ``profound importance'' of the issue and said that ``the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution.''
``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will play a different role in determining the text of what may become a law, such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,'' Stevens said.
Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is a former Arizona state lawmaker, dissented, along with Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer.
The law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after President Clinton vetoed provisions they sought.
