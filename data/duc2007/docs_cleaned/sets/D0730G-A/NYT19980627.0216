As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.
Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.
It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.
The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.
Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.
This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.
On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.
This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.
Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.
The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about ``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.
Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.
The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?
Moore lists a few worth pondering.
This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.
Some $250,000 was appropriated for research on pickles.
New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.
Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.
Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.
This is why some fiscal conservatives may be secretly breathing a sigh of relief and thanking the Supremes.
