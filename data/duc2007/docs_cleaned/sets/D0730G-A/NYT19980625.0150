The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures.''
Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government.
Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws.
One was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the law, claiming it was injured by the veto.
The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers' cooperatives.
In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president.
On Thursday, the high court agreed.
Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case, saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into law, were unconstitutional.''
In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.
In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.
Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts a constitutional edge ... it does not violate any basic separation of powers principle.''
In other major decisions Thursday, the court ruled: By a 6-3 vote that the attorney-client privilege does not end with the death of the client.
It thus blocked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's attempt to obtain notes taken by James Hamilton, the lawyer for deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster Jr. nine days before Foster committed suicide in July 1993.
That the government can deny cash grants to artists because their work is considered indecent, saying the policy does not violate artists' free-speech rights.
The 8-1 decision said the National Endowment for the Arts can consider decency, as well as artistic merit, in deciding who gets public money for the arts.
That HIV-infected people are protected by a federal ban on discrimination against the disabled even if they suffer no symptoms of AIDS.
The 5-4 ruling ordered a lower court to reconsider whether a Maine dentist violated the Americans With Disabilities Act when he refused to fill an HIV-infected woman's tooth in his office.
