China has successfully collected natural benthal electric data using an electromagnetic survey machine at 200 meters under the sea, according to official sources.
The machine that can work at a maximum depth of 500 meters was developed by a research team led by He Jishan, an expert with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
The test was taken at the electric field under the sea of the Taiwan Straits.
Sea electromagnetic surveying is an advanced benthal exploration measure.
China has pinpointed benthal surveying research as a key national technological project, which has been undertaken by the Zhongnan University in central China's Hunan Province.
It is expected to facilitate the country's exploration seabed geography and benthal resources.
