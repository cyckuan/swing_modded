In September 1999, a storm hit Lake George that wasn't quite as perfect as the one you can watch at the movies these days, but for an inland tempest, it was as good as they get.
State authorities who oversee Lake George say 150 boats were sunk when Tropical Storm Floyd was over, and all have been recovered.
Divers, however, say it might have been more like 200.
That difference of 50 boats is the stuff lake-bottom lore is made of.
If any boats sunk last fall remain under water, none have been spotted and with big fines likely, any owner of a still-swamped boat would probably prefer to keep it that way.
Still, the notion persists that a bevy of cabin cruisers are waiting to be found, at rest among the sloops, the treasure chests and even the sea monsters that live in the imaginations of lake watchers.
What is true, however, is that over the centuries ships have gone down to storms and in battles; others were deliberately scuttled in the days before strict laws forbade such sinkings.
One vessel, a 15-foot homemade submarine built to study French and Indian War wrecks, was stolen from its dock in 1960 before it even made a trial run.
Its fate was one of the lake's big mysteries until 1995, when Bateaux Below divers found the rusted hulk in deep water, midlake.
Mystery half-solved: No one can say how it got there.
Bateaux Below, a Saratoga Springs-based diving group that studies Lake George, has undertaken a lake-bottom inventory that might, over the next decade or so, take the guesswork out of many such tales of the deep.
But here are some mysteries that endure: In the deep water along the ``narrows'' at midlake, a 60-foot sailing vessel with a 65-foot mast is believed to be submerged, its sides collapsed, an open safe lying next to the wreck.
Its existence is not confirmed.
It is said that a treasure chest was found by two divers south of Diamond Island, near where the Forward wreck lies.
Divers say the chest is sunk in 120 feet of water and some continue to search for it today, but others note that waters off the island do not exceed 110 feet.
In the 1850s, a storm took down a three-mast sailing vessel (known as a ``bark'') in the middle of the lake with its full crew aboard.
One man jumped off before the storm became too powerful, and lived to tell a tale of violent winds and a crew member who tied himself to the mast to ride out the storm.
The ship has never been found.
The British vessel Halifax, a sloop-of-war, disappeared and may be somewhere in Lake George.
Over 50 feet long, it participated in both the 1758 Abercrombie expedition and the 1759 Amherst expedition.
Some historians believe it was dragged ashore and left to rot.
What ever became of the Ganouskie?
The steamboat was a lake attraction in the mid-19th century, then retired and moored at Big Burnt Island, where it was a floating bar.
When the bar failed, it is said the ship was scuttled in deep water off Dome Island, near Bolton Landing.
Divers are still making discoveries in Lake George.
But surely, some of the wrecks that divers hunt for never did exist.
And with the Bateaux Below survey poised to identify everything on the lake floor, those nonexistent wrecks may be the most thrilling to hunt for in years to come for divers who thrive on mystery.
