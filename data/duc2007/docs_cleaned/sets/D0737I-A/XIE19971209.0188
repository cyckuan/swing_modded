China has succeeded in building and utilizing a robot recently to survey Pacific Ocean depths of 6,000 meters, according to today's "Economic Information Daily."
The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this high-tech sector, experts said.
Exploration of the ocean floor at 6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations.
In addition, oceanic research robots must adjust to unexpected problems.
The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record, measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water conditions and search for missing objects while automatically recording data, according to the report.
