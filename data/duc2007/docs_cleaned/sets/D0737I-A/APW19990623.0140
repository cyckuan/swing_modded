only to meet death in a fierce tempest.
Both vessels were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled with wine.
Remarkably, the amphorae were found intact, stacked snugly in rows, unlike the shards typically unearthed on land.
Archaeologist Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one of our greatest moments.''
Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of suspending history in time.
``Human history lost in the high seas is waiting to be discovered,'' said Ballard, who was propelled to fame by his 1985 discovery of the ocean liner Titanic.
Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global positioning satellite.
He was led to the area after a team looking for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago, photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient shipwreck.
The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor at a depth of about 1,500 feet.
The fact that they sank straight to the bottom and were located within two miles of each other indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said.
Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to find more ancient wrecks along the same path.
One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45 feet.
The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on consignment, Stager said.
Stone anchors were found, as well as crockery, a wine decanter and incense stands for offering prayers to the weather gods.
Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every voyage, but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats.
Based on the pots and crockery found aboard, Stager said he believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew.
Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician ships ever found, and will aid historians and archaeologists, who until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea about Phoenician shipping.
Phoenicians were a seafaring people who lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years, beginning in 2300 B.C.
Stager said the findings were preliminary, noting that the expedition ship had just docked Tuesday night.
More would be revealed in the coming months when the artifacts are brought to Harvard for study, he said.
Ballard's expedition was sponsored by the National Geographic Society, the U.S. Office of Naval Research and an Israeli archaeological institute.
It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological ruins in deep water, partly thanks to newly developed technology.
Past deep-water expeditions had discovered only modern ruins, such as the Titanic.
Two other ship wrecks found in recent years are older than the Phoenician find, dating to around 1300 B.C.
But they were found in shallower waters and were not in as good condition.
Ballard said the answer to many of history's mysteries could be found under the sea.
