Last October's discovery of natural gas-hydrate resources in the seabed of the Xisha Isles of the South China Sea is the first of its kind in China, according to the Guangzhou Maritime Geological Investigation Bureau.
Natural gas-hydrate, also known as "combustible ice," "gas ice" or "solid gas," is a pure, clean, high-power and environmentally- friendly energy which has great development potential in 21st century.
The study of the gas-hydrate resources has been listed as one of the bureau's major exploration projects.
Scientists believe the East China Sea and the frozen earth area of the Tibetan Plateau are also possible reserves of natural gas hydrate.
