The provincial government is weighing a request by Lloyd's of London to search the Swissair crash site for $300 million in diamonds and jewels reportedly aboard the plane, according to news reports.
The British firm, through a Canadian insurance company, has asked the Nova Scotia government for permission to hunt for the valuables, said CBC-TV, Canada's national broadcast network.
Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean just off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 passengers on board.
The cause of the crash still hasn't been determined.
The plane's manifest indicates that 4{ pounds of diamonds and 11 pounds of jewelry were aboard when it went down.
The valuables have not been found.
The reports said the insurance company plans to use a mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in about 200 feet of water.
The diamonds were reportedly in a stainless steel tube, which may have disintegrated on impact or been driven deep into the seabed.
Lloyd's told CBC-TV last week that it hopes to begin the search this summer.
Lloyd's officials in London were unavailable for comment Monday evening and calls to a spokesman's cell phone were unanswered.
Nova Scotia Natural Resources Minister Ernie Fage has said the government will make a decision on whether to allow the search in a couple of weeks.
Fage said he wouldn't rule out allowing it, adding that he will consider concerns of family members.
Ian Shaw, whose daughter died in the crash, argued before the Nova Scotia legislature Friday that no one should be allowed to ''rake through'' the site.
He said other relatives of the victims also opposed the plan.
Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who represents communities near the crash site, wants the province to reject any treasure trove application ''because of the sacredness of the site.''
