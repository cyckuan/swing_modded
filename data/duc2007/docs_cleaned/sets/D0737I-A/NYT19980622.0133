In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes, possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road.
Off the coast of New York, an expedition led by oceanographer Robert Ballard and archeologist Kevin McBride of the University of Connecticut will search for signs of human settlements that may predate any ever found on land on the East Coast, perhaps revealing how and when this part of the continent was first settled maybe as far back as the height of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago.
Coming close on the heels of stunning discoveries last year, the searches represent the dawning of another era in archeology, a dramatic advance made possible by oceanographic research tools, including precisely-controllable robotic vehicles with electronic cameras, and high-resolution sonar detectors.
Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data.
In just three weeks, a Mediterranean expedition, led by Boston University archeologist Anna Marguerite McCann and Ballard, discovered five Roman shipwrecks spanning virtually the entire history of Roman maritime trade.
These ships lay as much as 2,800 feet deep on the ocean floor.
Before then, no ancient wreck had been found deeper than 300 feet.
Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were better preserved than any found in shallow water.
At those depths, McCann said, there is little of the activity that quickly destroys shallower shipwrecks, including wind and wave action, devouring by marine creatures, or looting by treasure hunters.
``The deep sea's opened up'' for archeology, said McCann in an interview last week.
And it was last year's remarkably successful Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often tradition-bound field of archeology, she said.
``It was a breakthrough, a true beginning for marine archeology.''
Her colleagues in the field were profoundly critical, McCann said, when Ballard first offered back in 1989 to apply his team's equipment and expertise to the untested idea of deep-water archeology.
They were skeptical because Ballard was not an archeologist, because of his high public profile since his discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, and because they thought robotic deep-sea vehicles would be too clumsy to recover artifacts without breaking them, she said.
``Ballard is not an archeologist,'' McCann conceded, ``but I'm not an engineer or an oceanographer.
The technology is here, and there are treasure hunters using this and selling stuff.
In weighing whether to go against her colleagues' advice and join the expedition, said McCann, now 65, who already was considered one of the nation's leading authorities on Roman-era archeology, ``I thought, `Why not?
I'm old, I don't have to worry about tenure.'''
Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University, which already has one of the nation's leading departments for dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater archeology.
What is needed now, according to both oceanographers and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and in the technology of deep marine exploration.
Ballard sees himself as a kind of matchmaker in helping to bring about the marriage of these two fields.
``There's a new opportunity here,'' he said last week, ``to bring together the world of oceanography with the world of archeology, and to try to create a new field of science.''
Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years.
But deeper water, where only expensive submersibles, submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank, in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.
That year, with thousands of schoolchildren watching through a satellite link as part of Ballard's educational Jason Project, the team discovered a Roman shipwreck they dubbed the Isis.
It was eight years before they were able to take the second step last year's return expedition to the area.
This time, they had some new tools: the Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine to perform the initial reconaissance and locate promising sites, and a sophisticated array of sonar equipment and digital cameras added to the Jason, the world's most precisely-controllable ROV.
The three-week trip yielded eight discoveries, five of them Roman ships ranging in age from the first century BC to about 400 AD.
``What we did in the Mediterranean that had never been done before was to make quantitatively accurate maps of the site, to allow all the information from that wreck site to be preserved,'' said Dana Yoerger, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution whose job includes guiding the ROVs.
Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch as it takes its pictures.
The shapes and dimensions of objects in its photomosaics can be measured with the precision that archeologists achieve when they measure the position of every artifact and plot it on maps of land sites.
Thanks to the precision of this data, McCann said, ``I think the archeological community has been won over.''
Being able to find ancient artifacts in such deep sites not only opens up previously unreachable areas for research, it also allows the mapping of trade routes that were previously unknown.
It also means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better state of preservation than those found in shallower water.
Ballard, who last year left Woods Hole to head a new organization called the Institute for Exploration, based in Mystic, Conn., said it was the discovery of the Titanic that opened his eyes to that potential.
``What really amazed me about the Titanic was the preservation environment of the deep sea,'' he said.
``Ships that found their way to the bottom in deep water were very different'' from those near shore.
For one thing, near-shore wrecks are often rapidly buried under accumulating sediments; in the deep sea, sediments build up at an imperceptible rate of about a half-inch every thousand years, he said.
In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact.
He offers a vivid vivid illustration of that benign environment.
When the team returned to the Skerki Bank site, the imprint in the mud of an amphora they had removed eight years earlier was still clearly visible.
The preservation may be even better in the Black Sea, Ballard said .
``It is the largest body of water in the world with no oxygen,'' he said, and without oxygen the marine organisms that often devour all the exposed wood in a wrecked ship are unable to survive there.
David Mindell, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will lead the Black Sea expedition, said the explorers hope to find evidence of a trade route directly across the sea through deep water.
``It would have been the maritime equivalent of the Silk Road,'' he said.
``It would have been a pretty significant shortcut, if you could make it work, between the Mediterranean and Central Asia.''
Some ancient texts, he said, suggest such a route was indeed used.
Oceanographers have found that until about 7,000 years ago, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake about 300 feet shallower than its present level, and that it was flooded when the Mediterranean broke through the Bosporus.
That flooding, which may have buried ports in areas that are now far offshore, is believed to have taken place very rapidly, and some archeologists think it may have been the origin of the Biblical story of the deluge.
Similarly, the site Ballard's group will explore this week off Long Island was also high and dry for many millennia, and may hold sites that were once hunting encampments on land.
Until about 12,000 years ago, when most of what is now New England was buried under a mile-thick sheet of ice, the continental shelf was exposed and may have been occupied by the ancestors of native Americans.
Connecticut's Mashantuck and Pequot tribes are helping to finance this week's reconnaissance mission, which will once again use the Navy's NR-1 submarine, in hopes of learning about their distant ancestors.
``This is the first time anyone has gone out in this region thinking paleo-Indians,'' Ballard said.
The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied in new places, McCann said.
``The technology is here,'' she said.
``This is new knowledge, a new opportunity, and we've got to get in there make use of it.''
