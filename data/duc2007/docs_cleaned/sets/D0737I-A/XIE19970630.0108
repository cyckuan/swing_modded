Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years, the Vanguard reported today.
The newspaper quoted a Shell publication as saying that the oil reserve in the deep waters of the west Africa is as high as 15 billion barrels.
Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited.
The exploration wells drilled by the company in the waters near Warri in southwest Nigeria have shown encouraging signs that could lead to commercial development, said Shell manager Kisito Okpere.
Shell will also carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Cote d'Ivoire, the report said.
