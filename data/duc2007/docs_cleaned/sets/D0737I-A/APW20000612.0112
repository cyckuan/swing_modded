Video screens displayed fantastical pictures of otherworldly landscapes below the waves and beyond the sun Monday as President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton hosted the latest in a series of White House lectures on science, arts and letters.
Monday's session on space and sea exploration featured gee-whiz science demonstrations and scientists' musings on what future explorations might yield.
Schoolchildren asked questions in person and over the Internet.
''We must continue as a nation to set out for new frontiers, whether under the sea or into the heavens,'' Clinton said at the start of the 90-minute session.
''We must continue to try to conquer the seemingly impossible, to discover the unimaginable, to find out more about what's out there, and in the process about ourselves and what's here.''
Clinton announced federal participation in three new undersea exploration projects: A deep-water canyon off the coasts of New York and New Jersey; reefs deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's Gulf Coast; and an ocean mountain range off California.
He also directed the Commerce Department to form an advisory panel of scientists to recommend priorities and goals for new ocean exploration.
Although oceans cover some 70 percent of the Earth's surface, scientists estimate that 90 percent of that space remains unknown to humans.
Clinton and scientists predicted Monday that some of the organisms found in those depths might one day provide medical cures or lessons for industry and human development.
Clinton fidgeted at times but also looked amazed as two prominent scientists, undersea explorer Marcia McNutt of California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Neil de Grasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, traded what-ifs about the future.
The lecture was the ninth of a program conceived by Mrs. Clinton as part of the White House millennium year commemoration.
