One of the biggest international science ventures undertaken in New Zealand waters will begin later this month with the arrival of an advanced French research ship to carry out a program of deep sea drilling.
Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday reported that scientists from 11 countries, including New Zealand, France, Australia and Britain, are due to join the flagship Joides Resolution as it has drilled seven holes along the eastern coast of New Zealand to retrieve sediment and rock for analysis.
The Dominion quoted New Zealand scientist Lionel Carter, one of the researchers who will be on board, as saying that the project is part of a global initiative to determine how the oceans tick and influence climate.
The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more than 1,300 sites around the world.
The New Zealand visit, dubbed "Leg 181" and hoping to uncover the history of the South Pacific Ocean in the past 32 million years, will last two months.
The bill for the New Zealand leg has been estimated at six million U.S. dollars, funded mainly by the United States' National Science Foundation.
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed.
Dr. Carter said this is truly a remarkable capability considering the ship will be bobbing in the ocean with 4 km of rotating drill pipe snaking through current-swept waters to the seabed and penetrating several hundred meters below to obtain the core material.
New Zealand's eastern coast has been chosen because of its position across the great current systems of the ocean.
New Zealand is the visible part of a vast submarine continent, half the size of Australia, that projects deep into the pathways of the currents, Dr. Carter said.
