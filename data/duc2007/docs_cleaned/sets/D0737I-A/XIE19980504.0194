Since April last year, China has successfully been using steel caissons to develop oil in the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
This is the first time China has used this technology in offshore oil production, Jiang said.
He explained that the new technology effectively prevents sedimentation and icing on a drilling platform, and a new 10-meter-thick oil-bearing stratum has been discovered.
The Jinzhou 9-3, which is 20 km from the city of Jinzhou in Liaoning Province, has proven oil reserves of 30.8 million tons.
The oilfield was discovered by the Bohai Oil Company in the late 1980s.
The water over the oilfield is 7 m deep, making conventional oil development methods costly and difficult for recovering investment.
After eight years of study, petroleum engineers decided to use the steel caissons for efficiency and safety.
The oilfield's eastern section will not have any living facilities, but will be linked with the other section by a 2.7-km marine pipeline and a marine cable.
The caissons for the western section have been completed and are expected to be installed soon, according to Jiang.
The Jinzhou Oilfield is expected to have 27 production wells, 26 water filling wells, and one natural gas well, and a designed annual capacity of a million tons.
The oilfield will cost 1.8 billion yuan and will go into production in 1999.
The Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu of Tianjin in 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets and 10,000 employees.
