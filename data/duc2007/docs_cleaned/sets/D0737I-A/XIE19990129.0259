China has recorded new advances in the exploration of seabed polymetallic nodules in the eastern Pacific and planning for commercial mining in the next century, according to the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (COMRRDA).
China has explored the international seabed since the late 1970s.
Related operations yielded extensive data and information on the 150,000-sq.km.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea requires China to relinquish 50 percent of the aforementioned area by March 5 this year.
However, China will retain the right to explore for polymetallic nodule resources in the remaining 75,000-sq.km.
"China has developed a complete set of deep-sea mining techniques and will continue to develop new techniques," according to a COMRRDA spokesman.
