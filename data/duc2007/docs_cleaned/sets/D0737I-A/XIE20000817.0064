The crippled Russian nuclear submarine Kursk with its trapped crew of 118 is slowly sinking deeper into the Barents Sea floor, although rescue is still possible, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said Thursday.
"This process is very slow and does not significantly impact on the rescue operation," the Interfax news agency quoted Dygalo as saying.
However, the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules are trying to attach, so far in vain, remain accessible.
"Due to the weather conditions, the attempts to dock with the submarine have once again failed," Dygalo said.
Weather has somewhat improved but a fresh breeze continues to blow and there is still fog and drizzle on the surface.
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Russian Navy press service said.
As rescue efforts continue, experts are analyzing video and photo materials picturing the damage done to the bow of the sub.
The accident reportedly happened last Saturday.
"The situation is estimated as being critical," the press service stressed.
More than 20 ships on the surface were involved in the rescue bid.
The ill-fated submarine was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up to 500 meters.
The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles.
The vessel can operate autonomously for up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and Norway in the rescue bid.
It had earlier refrained from seeking outside assistance.
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday and the two discussed the rescue operation, Putin's senior aide Sergei Prikhodko said.
They discussed concrete aspects of the rescue efforts, Prikhodko said.
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
The offer was extended Wednesday through the German embassy in Moscow and to Russian Navy command officers holding consultations at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on assisting in the rescue of the crew of the sunken sub, Interfax reported, quoting diplomatic sources in Moscow.
