multinational scientific team has recovered the first rock sample from deep beneath the Antarctic ocean bed in a bid to reveal what happened in the frozen continent 30-100 million years ago, an Australian earth scientist on the team said today.
Ken Woolfe from James Cook University in Australia's northern Queensland state said 51 scientists from six countries were involved in the research.
James Cook University is the only Australian signatory to the International Cape Roberts Project involving the research on the Antarctic which got underway earlier this month.
"My own work will involve looking at the description of the rocks and interpreting the environment in which they were formed," Woolfe was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
He said the scientists were excited by the project because nothing was known about what happened in the Antarctic when the ice sheet was first forming.
"We think we'll find there was a time when there was no ice at all in the Antarctic.
We don't know how it occurred or when it occurred," he said.
By being able to understand the past, scientists would be better able to predict the future and understand how the Antarctic would react to global warming, he said.
"If all the ice in the Antarctic melted at once, sea levels all over the Earth would rise by 60 meters," he said.
Woolfe said the research, the largest ever scientific project undertaken in the Antarctic, was fraught with potential logistical nightmares.
"What we've basically done is putting a drilling rig on the sea ice, then drilled through the ice and water and then finally 400 meters into the seabed," he said.
"But we have to have exactly the right conditions, which really only gives us about eight to 10 weeks to work in."
He said the weather had to be cold enough to keep the ice stable yet not so cold that it made the steel of the 20-tonne drilling rig brittle.
Violent storms which could fracture the ice and potentially plunge the rig into the ocean posed another risk for the researchers, he said.
Because of the high risks involved, the research team lives at a camp 10 kilometers from the drilling site and members are flown to the rig by helicopter to work on 12-hour shifts in minus 21 Celsius centigrade conditions.
Besides the scientists, 20 drilling and support staff from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Germany and Britain are involved in the project which will continue drilling until the end of November and then resume next summer.
