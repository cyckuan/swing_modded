Oil companies operating in Nigeria have achieved encouraging results in deep water oil exploration although a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars was spent between 1993 and 1998.
Shell's deep water oil exploration in its Bonga field has come up with exciting results which can be compared to the huge discoveries made in Angola, Congo, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea when brought on stream by 2001, This Day newspapers Tuesday quoted Elf General Manager Daniel Ndafe as saying.
Industry sources said that the Bonga discovery held billion of barrels in proven reserves, making it biggest discovery by any of the multi- nationals operating in Nigeria's deep offshore region.
The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country's deep water terrain could hold the key to meeting the government's set target of increasing daily crude oil production to four million barrels per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of 2010.
Ndafe said that from 1993 to 1998, 33 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled, 21,000 square kilometers of 2-D seismic work conducted in the frontier terrain and an additional 21,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic work carried out.
