Nigeria is to join the league of deep offshore oil producers in the world when the nation's first deep water oil field commences production in the year 2003, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
The country is now executing an oil project through Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO) at a cost of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars.
According to a statement issued by SNEPCO, the "Bonga" oil field is located 120 kilometers off the coast of the oil-producing Niger Delta region in water more than 1,000 meters deep.
The oil field, which has a reserve of 600 million barrels, will produce some 200,000 barrels of crude oil and 150 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day, the statement said.
Managing Director of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Phil Watts was quoted as saying that the project would help establish Nigeria as a major player in the global energy sector.
The "Bonga" field is launched as a joint venture project, of which Esso has 20 percent of the share, Elf has 12.5 percent and Agip has 12.5 percent while the rest 55 percent is held by SNEPCO, the operator of the venture.
