Animals living on the ocean floor may be just as susceptible to climate change as surface-dwellers, the science journal, Nature, reports.
Researchers came to this conclusion after studying the fossil record of ostracods, minute clam-like crustaceans in deep-sea sediment at the bottom of the North Atlantic, dating from the Late Pliocene era more than 2.4 million years ago.
Most scientists believed the ocean floor was buffered against climate change by the water above it, but the journal's report today questions this deep sea environmental stability.
The diversity of deep sea animals seems to wax and wane over a 41,000-year cycle, says Dr Thomas Cronin, of the Geological Survey, Virginia, and Dr Maureen Raymo, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That cycle corresponds to the rhythmic vibration in the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation, which affects seasonality.
