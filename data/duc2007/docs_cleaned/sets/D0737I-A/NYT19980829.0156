Dutch scientists say they have discovered toxic industrial chemicals in the tissue of whales that normally feed in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
While the quantities detected may not be harmful to the huge mammals, the scientists say their findings, presented at a conference in Stockholm last week, should serve as a warning of how far the chemicals have penetrated the ocean's food chain.
Some findings also were reported in Nature magazine in July.
At issue are so-called polybrominated compounds that are used as flame retardants in many everyday products, like television-set casings and children's clothing.
While these chemicals can be useful to consumers, they appear to be resilient and harmful in nature.
Scientists say they behave much like PCBs and DDT, which were banned for their toxicity.
Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators.
The molecules do not dissolve easily in water and eventually find their way into animal and perhaps human tissue, they say.
``The study showed that we are seeing warning signals that more serious problems may be ahead,'' said Jacob de Boer, of the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research, who led the team that analyzed the whale tissue.
``These compounds are useful and relatively cheap, and industry has not been motivated to look for alternatives.
But maybe that time has come.''
For their most recent study, de Boer and a team of 10 Dutch scientists examined 13 sea mammals, including sperm and minke whales that were stranded on the Dutch coast in 1996 and 1997.
They said they found traces of the compounds in the animals' fat and sometimes in the liver.
Significant levels of the compounds had already been found in sea creatures that live near the coast, like dolphins and seals, but finding them in minke and sperm whales is more disturbing, de Boer said, because these whales normally feed at a depth of about 1,000 to 3,600 feet and the males hunt as far north as Iceland, where the ocean is presumed to be clean.
