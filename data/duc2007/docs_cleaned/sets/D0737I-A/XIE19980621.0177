The amount of losses from various marine disasters including the red tide has reached some 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars), as against 1 billion yuan each year in the 1980s.
So, seabed forests are an effective way to help sustainable development, Zeng said, and the country's oceanography authorities has a positive attitude toward this giant scheme.
Song Xiuwu, an oceanographer who presided over the seaweed planting project in Changdao, joined Zeng in suggesting that algae, shellfish, and rare marine products be developed in the offshore areas.
The two also emphasized the study of proliferation and protection of various algae on the seabed and different "afforestation" projects, and Zeng even hoped to establish a "seaweed growing festival" to get more attention.
