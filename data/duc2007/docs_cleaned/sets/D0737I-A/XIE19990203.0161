China has announced it is to draw up boundaries for its exclusive mineral mining operations in 75,000 square kilometers of the eastern section of the Pacific Ocean where it intends to intensify its exploration activities.
In 1991, China was officially recognized by the United Nations as one of the pioneering investors in international seabed exploration and acquired the mining right in an area of 150,000 sq.
After surveys indicated poor reserves in large tracts of the original zone, China has given up the right for about half of the area.
It will now concentrate on the new, smaller mining zone which geologists estimate could have an annual production capacity of three million tons of rare metals such as manganese, nickel and cobalt.
The reserves are expected to last for at least 20 years, which will help ease the shortage of such rare metals in China throughout the early part of the next century.
The newly designated area is estimated to contain about 112 million tons of manganese, 4 million tons of copper, 5 million tons of nickel and 980,000 tons of cobalt.
According to Jin Xianglong, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), the metals and minerals are scattered on the sea-bed "like potatoes".
He added, "China has now acquired the advanced technology to pick up these 'potatoes like' lumps of rock and metal from the deep sea."
After much research Chinese engineers have developed a robot which can operate 6,000 meters underwater and will be used in such deep-sea mining.
However, this type of exploration requires high technology and a large investment with a concurrent high risk factor, warned Jin Jiancai, secretary-general of the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association.
Explaining the need to find more reserves of rare metals on the ocean beds, Jin went on to say that because of the pace of development in technologies, modern instruments and telecommunications, China's land-based rare metals resources only have a further 30 to 50 years of life.
"As a result, the shortage of rare metals would have great impact on people's lives," said Wang Dianzuo, vice president of the CAE.
He explained, for example, that the batteries used in mobile phones consume a large amount of nickel every year.
"If those nickel resources are exhausted, people will lose the convenience brought about by mobile phones," he said, adding the crisis will also appear in other areas using products needing rare minerals and metals.
