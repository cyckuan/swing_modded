Debilitating fatigue forced her to abandon the BB.
For three to four months, she would feel well.
Then the fatigue would return with a vengeance, knocking her flat for two weeks to two months.
``It devastated me financially,'' she says.
She suffered chronic back problems, gastrointestinal disorders, recurrent yeast infections, fever and night sweats, excruciating muscle pain.
``You lay in bed and cry because your entire body hurts.''
She was treated for countless diseases but continued to languish.
For almost five months in 1994, she couldn't keep food down and lived on liquid supplements sipped a few tablespoons every hour.
Her weight slipped from 135 to 102.
When doctors treated her for reflux disease, she improved some and subsisted on a liquid diet.
She was still far from healthy.
The next year, a holistic doctor told her she had liver disease.
But she tested negative for what ultimately would be her diagnosis: hepatitis C, once known by the vague label ``non-A, non-B'' hepatitis.
For perhaps 20 years, she would learn, the hepatitis C virus had been preying on her body, causing chronic inflammation of her liver, an organ whose job is to detoxify and discard products produced in the body.
It also manufactures proteins, clotting factors and hormones.
Hepatitis C, which experts say is reaching epidemic proportions, has become the leading reason for liver transplants.
Such celebrities as daredevil Evel Knievel and singer Naomi Judd a former nurse have hepatitis C. Rock singer David Crosby underwent a liver transplant in 1994 after fighting alcoholism and hepatitis C. How could Ward have contracted such a nasty disease?
Hepatitis C most often is passed from person to person by way of blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, unsterile needles used in body piercing or tattooing, accidental needle sticks by health-care workers, and, to a lesser extent, unsafe promiscuous sex.
Ward says that in her younger days, she dabbled in marijuana and cocaine.
Snorting cocaine can rupture tiny blood vessels in the nostrils and allow tainted blood to be passed when coke straws are shared.
She has a tattoo.
Ward also has discovered that several former friends who were patients of her dentist in California have come down with hepatitis C. Did unsterile dental equipment convey the virus?
She may never know the cause of her disease, but her concern now is to keep it at bay and ward off the worst of liver ailments cirrhosis and cancer.
Cirrhosis produces scarring of the liver tissue and prevents it from performing its detoxification duties.
Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that works on hepatitis C: interferon.
She calls it her ``year in hell.''
Used alone, interferon results in remission in about 20 percent of cases.
Participating in an experimental program at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, she has been giving herself injections of interferon three times a week.
She also has been taking a pill that may be a drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of interferon and double its cure rate.
Because she is in a double blind study, she may have been taking a placebo.
For some people, interferon treat ment can be nearly as devastating as the disease it's meant to cure.
``You feel like you have the flu all the time,'' says Ward, who has battled lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast infections, urinary-tract infections and depression all because of the treatment.
She believes that her illness is in remission.
If the interferon ultimately proves ineffective, however, she would begin a second course.
Treatment is a financial burden.
Ward lives with her elderly mother, who is blind and has cancer, and depends on public assistance.
She is hoping to find a job and obtain Social Security disability payments.
To bolster her emotional state, she attends a support group for hepatitis C patients but says that can be troubling.
Although she receives solace from group members, dealing, in turn, with their woes is saddening.
She would like personal counseling but can't afford it.
Though her condition has improved, Ward fears a relapse.
``Since I'm in remission I feel I'm going to get better,'' she says.
``But what happens six months from now?''
At one time, Ward felt guilty about her disease.
Family members have been emotionally and financially supportive, but some relatives refuse to visit her, believing they will become infected.
That is hurtful, Ward says, and adds to the stigma.
Now, noting how many other people have hepatitis C an estimated 4 million representing all walks of life she no longer feels shame, which has given her the courage to counsel others.
She even advocates for patients seeking transplants, though she has decided that she would not undergo transplant surgery herself if her condition deteriorated.
``It's a personal choice,'' she says.
``This is the way I came into the world, and this is the way I'll leave this world.
``I have this disease.
