It started with an earache.
But in a scenario every parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost as menacing.
Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed it.
At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and her teeth were pushed out of place.
Surgeons resorted to removing half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor grew back.
``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period in 1994.
``We were thinking, now what?''
Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other side grew normally.
Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr. Leonard Kaban of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr. Judah Folkman, head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby tissues.
In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF).
He suspected that Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to sprout new vessels to feed it.
And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down overproduction of FGF.
The test showed that Folkman was right.
Her blood contained many times the normal amount of FGF.
``That was exciting, because now we had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in large doses.
``We started giving her small injections at night, and by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around the house,'' said her mother.
The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels of FGF fell.
That was strong evidence that the interferon was shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of new blood vessels.
Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
Tuesday, Jennifer is 9.
The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor, appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown, somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong.''
The LaChances live in Lincoln, R.I.
It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis the growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six other cases, says Folkman.
The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible isn't clear, said Kaban.
She is still missing all her lower teeth on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she can have implants put in when she's older.
Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood supply.
Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman says.
Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a long period.
That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to control cancer.
