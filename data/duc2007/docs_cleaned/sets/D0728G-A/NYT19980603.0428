Four million Americans are estimated to have chronic hepatitis C, and 10,000 die from it each year.
The disease is the leading reason for liver transplantation.
The newly approved treatment, known as Rebetron, works far better than sole standard treatment.
But it is expensive, it poses serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who take it.
Although it can eradicate signs of infection, it cannot be called a cure.
And doctors say that not everyone with hepatitis C needs it.
The treatment consists of a six-month course of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules.
The full course of therapy will cost $6,400 to $8,600, depending on how high a dose a patient needs.
Rebetron, which is made by Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., has been approved for use only in people who relapse after the standard treatment for hepatitis C, which is a course of interferon injections.
That therapy eliminates the disease in only 10 percent to 20 percent of patients.
About half do not respond to interferon at all.
The remaining 30 percent to 40 percent respond to interferon and then relapse, and those are the patients for whom Rebetron has been approved.
Tested in such a group, Rebetron reduced the virus to undetectable levels in 45 percent, an effect that persisted when the patients were tested again six months after treatment ended.
In patients given interferon alone, only 5 percent had undetectable levels.
In studies of patients who responded to interferon alone, he said, those who were free of the virus at six months remained so at six years.
``But I'm not sure we won't find people with recurring disease as we go further out,'' Seeff said.
``We need a much longer time to follow all these people.
The proof will come 20 years from now.''
Even though Rebetron has been approved only for patients who have relapsed after trying interferon, doctors will be free to prescribe it as they see fit.
Seeff and Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national institute said they expected that many doctors would prescribe it for all hepatitis C patients, including those who have not taken interferon or who did not respond to it.
Hoofnagle said data had been presented at medical meetings showing that when the combination was given for one year to people who had never been treated before, the relapse rate was only 20 percent.
Given the poor response rate with interferon alone, he said, it seems reasonable to go straight to the combination.
But the drugs can have serious side effects.
While interferon alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or stroke.
It can also cause birth defects, so women must avoid pregnancy while they take it and for six months after.
Psychiatric problems have also been reported.
In addition, the interferon component of the treatment causes flulike symptoms.
Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate, Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with hepatitis C. Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
It is impossible to predict just which ones will become severely ill, but medical authorities now recommend treatment only for patients who have detectable viral levels and abnormal results on tests of liver enzymes.
Others can be monitored and treated later if the disease seems to be progressing.
``If it's mild, I say let's follow it carefully and wait it out until we have a little bit better therapy,'' Hoofnagle said.
``Some people don't want to be treated at all, but others are so anxious that they don't care what you tell them and they just want to be treated.''
