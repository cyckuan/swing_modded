Hepatitis C is now being recognized as a major public health problem worldwide, an American expert said today in The Lancet medical journal.
In most developed countries, 1e to 2 percent of the population is infected with the virus, wrote Dr Adrian Di Bisceglie of Saint Louis University School of Medicine, in Missouri, the United States.
Infection rates are higher in some parts of eastern Europe and in Africa, and "Egypt seems to have one of the highest prevalence rates of all, approaching 15 percent of the general population."
Liver disease caused by hepatitis C is now the major reason for liver transplantation in adults in most countries.
In the United States alone, hepatitis C now causes 8,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.
"Furthermore, deaths are expected to more than triple over the next two decades, eventually becoming responsible for greater mortality than AIDS."
Hepatitis C is predominantly a blood borne disease.
Eighty-five percent of people infected with the virus in most cases will develop a chronic hepatitis and of these as many as 20 percent eventually develop cirrhosis.
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
In some cases the virus disappears from the blood and the inflammation of the liver is reduced.
Some studies also indicate that longer therapy lasting a year to 18 months may achieve a sustained response in as many as 30 percent of treated patients.
