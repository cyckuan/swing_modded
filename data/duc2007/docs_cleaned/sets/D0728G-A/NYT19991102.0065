In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial.
Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr. Jason Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C. Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on the prison health-care budget.
Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough Corp., a drug manufacturer based in Madison, N.J.
The other drug in the kit is Schering-Plough's brand of alpha interferon.
For a standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for the same cost,'' he said.
Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
Schering-Plough responded that the drug had been tested for this purpose only with its brand of interferon.
Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's prescription.
The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply, compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of the Schering-Plough kit.
Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible to provide the treatment to many more.
Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is safe and effective in combination with interferon.
An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on its response to Schering-Plough's complaint.
Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin after realizing that many patients, including some with health insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.
After the patent for Ribavirin expired recently, he said, the pharmacy's lawyers did some research and concluded that compounding the drug would be legal.
Kerrish also said he was contacted recently by an attorney in the Texas attorney general's office, who told him that the office was ``looking at investigating Schering-Plough'' for possible violations of anti-trust laws.
Kerrish said the attorney asked him questions about the drugs used to treat hepatitis C. In an Oct. 17 article, The Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger quoted an unnamed spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office as saying that an investigation of Schering-Plough was in the ``initial stages.''
Ted Delisi, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said that the office's policy is never to confirm or deny investigations.
