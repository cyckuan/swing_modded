The diagnosis turned out to be much worse: She had hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver.
She had probably been infected 15 or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all patients, she had developed a chronic infection.
The vast majority of people with chronic hepatitis C carry the virus indefinitely, apparently with few ill effects.
But about 20 percent develop cirrhosis and liver failure or cancer within 20 to 25 years of being infected.
The infection causes 8,000 to 10,000 deaths per year in the United States, and it has become the leading reason for liver transplants.
Mrs. Buchanan's lab tests and a biopsy revealed scarring of the liver, indicating that she might be one of the unfortunate ones in whom the disease would worsen.
Hoping to prevent further liver damage, her doctor recommended drug treatment to try to rid her system of the virus.
Mrs. Buchanan, who has four grown children and runs her own business, a ceramics studio, had never even heard of hepatitis C. ``I was terrified,'' she said.
During the next two decades, many more Americans are expected to find themselves in the same situation.
Most will be middle-aged people who feel fine now, but who will become ill, as Mrs. Buchanan did, and find out they were infected years ago.
Others will receive letters from the government and blood banks as part of a program to inform 300,000 people who may have been infected by transfusions before 1992, when a test for the hepatitis C virus came into use.
For people like Mrs. Buchanan, with clear signs of liver damage, doctors strongly recommend treatment.
But those who test positive for the virus but have no signs of disease will face difficult questions about whether to start treatment, because it is expensive, complicated by severe side effects and, in more than half of patients, unable to eradicate the virus.
Treatment is generally not recommended for those without signs of liver damage, but regular monitoring is, because in the early stages of infection it is impossible to tell whether the disease will progress.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and most of them do not know they are carrying it.
Those who know they need treatment may find themselves caught in a controversy similar to the ones that have erupted over high-priced treatments for AIDS.
Their interests have collided with those of a pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research expenses and turn a profit.
Meanwhile, some researchers say that the company, Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., is needlessly alarming Americans about the disease in its advertising.
Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.
There is no vaccine.
Before the test for the virus came into use, transfusions were the main route of transmission.
Since then, the number of new infections has plummeted.
But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease.
``To put it bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can get hepatitis C even you.''
The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising campaign has ``breached the public trust.''
But in a telephone interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word ``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4 million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the nation.
Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said, ``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting infected like crazy, and that's not so.''
Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, whether they need them or not.
He said more than 80 percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no disease whatsoever.''
But he added that people with the virus must never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the infection.
Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid of the virus.
Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said: ``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C. New cases have fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus.
The epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got into the population that donated blood.
People infected then are now turning 50 and 60, at which point hepatitis C rears its head.''
Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though donor organs are already in short supply.
Hepatitis deaths are also expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or 30,000 a year within a decade or so.
But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s.
By 1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new infections in the United States.
Among those who have injected drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less clear.
Although sexual contact does not seem to spread hepatitis C efficiently (unlike the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses), 20 percent of infected people report no other means of exposure.
Another 10 percent are thought to have been infected while working at a hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth, or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other way to infected blood.
For the final 10 percent, there is simply no explanation for the infection.
Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body piercing and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments could spread the virus the CDC says there is no evidence linking those practices to the disease in the United States.
Similarly, many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether that has occurred.
Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group, having never received a transfusion or taken drugs.
Her husband and other family members all tested negative for the virus, she said.
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
But half of patients do not respond to interferon at all, and Mrs. Buchanan was one of those.
At the time, interferon was the only treatment available.
In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did.
Nonetheless, Mrs. Buchanan wanted to try the combination treatment.
But because Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another company.
She had researched it on her own, and thought it might work better for her.
Her doctor agreed it was worth a try.
She quickly found out that would not be possible.
Schering-Plough had ``bundled'' the two drugs, packaging them together as a kit.
Patients could buy Schering's interferon alone, but not ribavirin.
Mrs. Buchanan did not want to purchase the entire kit a six-month supply costs $6,400 to $8,600 just to get the ribavirin.
The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C. Many, like Mrs. Buchanan, wanted to mix ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable.
The bundling also sent up a red flag among advocates for AIDS patients.
Some people taking a host of drugs to treat HIV also have hepatitis C, and want as much flexibility as possible in picking medications.
The AIDS groups began showing hepatitis patients how to do battle with big drug companies.
Jeff Getty, who is active in AIDS issues in San Francisco, said, ``The HIV and AIDS community is watching this and very much up in arms about it, because we know what it means for us.''
Getty said he feared that companies would similarly bundle combination treatments for AIDS, interfering with doctors' ability to prescribe different combinations for patients.
``Where does it stop?''
Getty asked.
``Do I have to buy their Kleenex taped to their nose spray, because they were tested together?
This is wrong.''
One AIDS group has begun buying ribavirin from Mexico, which imports it from a U.S. company.
The group provides it to hepatitis C patients at cost, which comes to less than half what ribavirin would cost in the bundled product.
Patients and advocacy groups asked the FDA to require that Rebetron be unbundled, but Dr. Heidi Jolson, director of the division of antiviral drugs at the agency, said its lawyers had determined that it lacked the regulatory authority to do so.
Jolson did write to Schering-Plough, saying that the product did not have to be bundled and that the agency would cooperate if the company decided to sell the drugs separately.
Consalvo, said Schering-Plough has listened to the concerns of patient advocates and is developing a program to help provide ribavirin to hepatitis patients whose doctors can prove that the patients have a need for it.
The program will start in January, he said, though patients who need help sooner may get it if their doctors contact the company.
That was news to Mrs. Buchanan, who said her letter to the company had never been answered.
