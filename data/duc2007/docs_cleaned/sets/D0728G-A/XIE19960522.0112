China has started to put into mass production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat liver diseases.
Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic engineering drug to be put into mass production in the biotechnology section of the country's "863 Hi-Tech Plan".
China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for scientific and technological development in 1978.
Biotechnology was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986, when the "863" plan was introduced.
So far, China has put onto the market five genetic engineering drugs, and another dozen such drugs are under research.
Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells and internationally acknowledged as efficacious for the treatment of liver diseases, experts said.
In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in the "863" plan.
He discovered for the first time that the white blood cells of Chinese people, when attacked by viruses, will produce "a 1" type instead of "a 2" type interferons.
To put the interferon into mass production, the Shenzhen Kexing Bioproducts Co. Ltd, China's largest genetic engineering medicine production base, was set up in 1993 under the State Science and Technology Commission.
