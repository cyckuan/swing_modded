Hepatitis C infects an estimated four million Americans and kills 8,000 to 10,000 a year.
The disease, spread mainly by dirty needles and exposure to infected blood, is the leading reason for liver transplants.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
The expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to patients who had not taken interferon.
The Rebetron treatment combines interferon injections with a second anti-viral drug, ribavirin, which is swallowed in capsules.
By the end of October, Rebetron sales had totaled $46 million, according to IMS Health, a firm that tracks the pharmaceutical industry.
The FDA cautioned that Rebetron is not a cure and that it is not known whether the treatment can delay the progression of liver disease caused by the virus.
It suppresses blood levels of the virus far better than interferon alone.
But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior.
It can also cause birth defects.
The expanded use was approved over the protests of patient advocates, who object to the way Rebetron is being sold.
Interferon and ribavirin are sold together as a kit, a practice known as bundling.
Patients cannot get ribavirin without purchasing the entire kit.
Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.
In another hepatitis treatment development, Glaxo Wellcome and Biochem Pharma said Wednesday that the FDA had approved their drug, lamivudine, as the first oral therapy for the treatment of hepatitis B.
In the United States, the drug will have a wholesale cost of $1,250 a year.
Lamivudine, also known as 3TC and marketed under the trade name Epivir, has previously been approved for the HIV virus, for which it is the most commonly prescribed drug.
Epivir for AIDS will generate an estimated $800 million in revenue this year.
Hepatitis B affects many more people than AIDS, perhaps as many as 350 million worldwide.
Most of those patients are in Asian countries, where the cost of the drug may be prohibitive, so analysts say it is difficult to estimate the potential market.
But there are an estimated one million hepatitis B patients in North America and about twice that many in Europe, where price is less of an issue.
