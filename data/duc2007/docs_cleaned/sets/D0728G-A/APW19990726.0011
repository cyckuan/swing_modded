pharmacy that has had to turn away hepatitis C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only treatment available has started selling the drugs itself at half the price.
Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month.
Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough Corp. ``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and still not be able to afford the drug?''
Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9 million people in the United States.
It can lead to chronic liver problems, including cirrhosis and cancer.
There is no vaccine against it.
Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the virus.
The company uses a type of interferon called Intron A, the only type approved for use with Ribavirin for treating hepatitis C. Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately, an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month.
The pharmacists said they have received about 10 calls a day from potential patients since they started the sales July 9.
For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell their drugs.
Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together just to make more money.
``Doctors and patients need to have the access and flexibility to make the choices they deem appropriate, not the drug company,'' he said.
Schering-Plough's president of U.S. marketing, Richard Zahn, denied the accusation: ``I think we're a company that cares about patients.''
Schering-Plough has asked the FDA to look into whether Fisher's is violating federal guidelines.
By promoting the drugs, the pharmacy is moving toward manufacturing, which is not allowed, Schering-Plough claims.
Kerrish said the pharmacy is meeting federal regulations and selling safe drugs.
However, the company says it is effective in only about 40 percent of the people who take it.
