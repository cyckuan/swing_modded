The finding, from an international study halted early because the results were so strong, could help thousands of patients who currently don't get treatment until they have substantial brain or nerve damage.
''It's a very important finding because it really shows if one starts treatment early on, one can change the fate of a patient,'' delaying or even preventing the onset of the disease, said Dr. Thomas Leist, director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
''It opens up a new perspective about treatment of multiple sclerosis,'' said Leist, who was not involved in the study, which will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up elsewhere in the central nervous system.
However, researchers at the State University of New York School of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective ''insulation'' coating nerve fibers.
That damage builds up over years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.
Some people merely suffer mild weakness for decades, while others steadily worsen from repeated attacks.
Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of the disease.
One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex, is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human protein, said the lead researcher, Dr. Lawrence Jacobs, professor of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital.
It works by reducing inflammation and quieting down the overactive immune system.
Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than half, compared with patients in the comparison group.
It also cut the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91 percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on Avonex's effects when it is used early.
The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI, Jacobs said.
Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains, they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients, something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be helped by aggressive treatment.
Leist said its price tag of about $10,000 annually could limit use.
He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than three years to determine how long they need the interferon treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if there are similar benefits when given earlier.
