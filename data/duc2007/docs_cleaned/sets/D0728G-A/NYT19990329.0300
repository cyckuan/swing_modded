French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo.
This is in itself a feat because outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks in Africa since its first appearance in 1979.
But this exotic virus gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days.
Second, researchers worry that Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may one day break out.
Led by Dr. Sylvain Baize and Eric M. Leroy of the International Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking difference in the first days of the infection between those who would eventually die and those who would survive.
Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
The research focused on the differences between those who lived and those who died.
They discovered that the immune defenses in the two groups were quite distinct.
The immune system puts up two general types of defense against invading microbes.
In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify and latch on to the invading bugs.
In the other, the cellular system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and cellular defenses.
These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within the first two to three days after infection.
They had a poor showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive production of interferon.
One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby passing information that would suppress the other side of the defense.
Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one or depressing the other.
Dr. Philip K. Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the work represented an important step in understanding how Ebola works.
Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help researchers test ideas.
For example, therapies that would suppress the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said.
But therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.
