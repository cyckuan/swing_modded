The Amensty International (AI) launched a worldwide campaign today in an attempt to force the Nigerian government out of what the organization called "comtempt for human rights".
The group has submitted a 10-point document on reform of human rights to the Nigerian government, demanding the immediate release of all prisoners.
In another development, the Nigerian government has uncovered plans by the AI to organize a massive demostration on November 10 this year.
