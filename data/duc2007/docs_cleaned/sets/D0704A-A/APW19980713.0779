Amnesty International called on Rwanda Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the country.
``The UN Human Rights Field Operation is one of the very few international organizations left monitoring and publicly reporting the human rights situation in Rwanda,'' said London-based Amnesty International.
``It would be disastrous if the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights now agrees to remove or dilute this essential part of the operation's mandate.''
The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission because of lack of coordination.
The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up following the 1994 genocide, was due for review.
Rwanda wants the mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its efforts to educating people about human rights.
The Amnesty statement said the Rwandan government has set a deadline of July 27 for reaching agreement on the mission's mandate, otherwise it will close down the operation.
``The human rights situation in Rwanda is critical,'' the Amnesty statement said.
``We receive almost daily reports about killings and `disappearances,' and the UNHRFOR is indispensable for investigating and documenting these cases on the ground.''
Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had sponsored the genocide.
The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead.
Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only in Nov. 1996.
Amnesty and the U.N. human rights agency have reported that thousands of people have since been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi military.
