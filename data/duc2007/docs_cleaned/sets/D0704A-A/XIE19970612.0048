Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has accused Amnesty International of applying double standard in the assessment of human rights violation in the country.
He was speaking on Wednesday at both the Kenyan International Conference Center and the Kenya Science Teachers College during a workshop of the stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises.
The president wondered why government officers serving in the police force were never regarded as victims of human rights violation whenever they were murdered or injured during their course of duty.
The Kenyan Head of State pointed out that Amnesty International treated police officers as if they were not part of mankind.
He wondered what standards were used to define human rights in Africa as children carried guns in certain countries while mass killings occurred in others yet no human rights action appear to deter the trend.
President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more serious in its work.
He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane, Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them on how to conduct their affairs.
At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects in the east African country.
In a statement in response to the manefesto and press release issued by Amnesty International, the Kenyan government said that all allegations by the organization were calculated to incite Kenyans against their government.
