Amnesty International on Friday demanded a government probe into what it said were unauthorized detention camps run by two armed Tamil groups opposed to the secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels.
In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the London-based human rights organization said the two groups were helping Sri Lanka's military fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, known as the LTTE.
``In the last few years, Amnesty International has repeatedly raised concern about the persistent practice on the part of the army and the police in the north and east to allow (if not encourage) members of armed Tamil groups opposed to the LTTE to carry out search operations or screen civilians,'' Amnesty International said in a statement.
The statement said the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization operated by more than 20 detention camps.
Sri Lanka's government has introduced several measures to safeguard the welfare of detainees, but Amnesty International said the measures are enforced poorly, if at all.
The Tamil Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka for the island country's minority Tamils.
They accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against Tamils in education and jobs.
More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 1983.
