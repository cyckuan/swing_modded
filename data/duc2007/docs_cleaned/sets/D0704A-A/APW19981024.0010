London-based human rights group Amnesty International accused the South Korean government Saturday of trying to control what was supposed to be an independent national human rights commission.
President Kim Dae-jung has promised to launch a watchdog commission to monitor human rights violations by police, prosecutors, intelligence officials and other government agencies.
But according to the Justice Ministry's draft law, most of the commission members will be government officials or people recommended by the justice minister and appointed by the president.
The draft legislation ``does not in its present form conform to international human rights standards.
It would result in a commission which lacks independence and investigative powers,'' Amnesty International Secretary General Pierre Sane said in an open letter to President Kim.
``We are therefore extremely concerned that the government ... intends to secure adoption of this law without adequate public consultation,'' said the letter, a copy of which was faxed to The Associated Press.
On Tuesday, Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon said the government plan was ``just a draft'' and more public consultation will follow.
President Kim, who had himself been persecuted by former authoritarian leaders, became the first opposition leader to win the presidency after emerging victorious from elections last December.
He has since promised to promote human rights.
