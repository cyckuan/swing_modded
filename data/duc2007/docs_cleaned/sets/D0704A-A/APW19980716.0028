With the 10th anniversary of Myanmar's failed democracy uprising approaching, London-based Amnesty International is urging the military government to avoid possible violence by improving human rights.
``As this important anniversary approaches, we hope that you will begin to defuse possibilities for conflict by taking immediate steps towards improving the human rights situation,'' Amnesty's International Secretary General Pierre Sane said Thursday.
His comments were contained in an open letter to Gen. Than Shwe, leader of the military government.
Sane suggested releasing political prisoners who were old and sick, freeing jailed members of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party and ending repression against candidates who won a 1990 election the military refused to honor.
August 8th will be the tenth anniversary of the day when millions of people across Myanmar, then called Burma, demanded an end to 26 years of military rule and the installation of a democratic government.
The military responded with brutal force, gunning down at least 3,000 protesters, including Buddhist monks, and jailing thousands of others.
Rumors of planned civil disobedience inside Myanmar on the anniversary have been circulating in Myanmar exile communities in Bangkok.
The anniversary ``holds great symbolic significance for the Burmese people and for the international community.
Amnesty International is deeply concerned, therefore, about the potential for heightened tension at this time between the authorities and political activists,'' Sane wrote.
``This has been reflected over the past few weeks by political arrests and increased restrictions and surveillance of opposition leaders,'' he added, referring to the recent beating of members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party by government security forces as they tried to visit her compound.
