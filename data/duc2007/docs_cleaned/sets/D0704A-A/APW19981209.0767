Lawyers for Amnesty International sought a High Court injunction Wednesday to stop Gen. Augusto Pinochet fleeing the country if the British government blocks his extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide and torture.
The lawyers moved as speculation increased that Home Secretary Jack Straw was close to announcing the decision he has to make by Friday.
Amnesty International fears that if Straw blocks extradition, the 83-year-old general will be whisked back to Chile before the group can make a last bid to keep him in Europe.
Its first move would likely be to argue before a judge that any decision by Straw to block extradition would be lawfully wrong.
``We are asking the court to give us the opportunity to challenge any decision he might make which is adverse to us,'' said Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer for Amnesty International and other human rights groups.
``Effectively, we are seeking an injunction deferring implementation of any adverse decision pending a challenge,'' Bindman said.
Meanwhile, the general's lawyers have complained that a five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, that ruled 3-2 on Nov. 25 that Pinochet did not have immunity from arrest is the head of Amnesty International fundraising arm.
Spain is seeking the general's extradition for killings and torture by his security forces during his 17-year regime.
Pinochet, not seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest in a London hospital, remained under police guard in a rented mansion at Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
Earlier, The Times of London reported that Straw had refused to give Bindman any advance notice of his decision.
From the other side, lawyers for Pinochet may ask the House of Lords to reconsider its decision because of Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann's connections to Amnesty International, British newspapers reported Wednesday.
