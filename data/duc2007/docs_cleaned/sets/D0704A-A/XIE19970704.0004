The human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused German police of racism in a report issued here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995.
According to Michael Butler, Amnesty's investigator responsible for Germany, evidence collected since 1995, which listed 40 cases involving police violence against non-Germans or German nationals of foreign extraction, showed that police racism was part of a pattern.
Butler also accused prosecutors of being dilatory over claims of police violence and the courts of being partial to police in dealing with such cases.
Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such complaints.
The Amnesty report was immediately challenged by the interior ministers of Germany's 16 states, who denied the police were racist as a whole and noted that the misdeeds of individual policemen were objectively and thoroughly investigated by prosecutors and the courts.
In Germany, every state has its own police force.
Amnesty International also complained of similar police violence in Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Austria and Switzerland.
