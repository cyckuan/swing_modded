Secretary General of the Amnesty International Pierre Sane warned today that Israel will set a sinister precedent if it legalizes forms of torture against Palestinian detainees.
Sane issued the warning during a meeting with Israeli Justice Minister David Liba'i here, urging Israel to stop such legislation.
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Sane criticized Israel's continued use of torture and other inhumane methods in interrogating Palestinian detainees suspected of being involved in violent attacks.
On the first visit ever by head of Amnesty International to Israel in nine years, Sane said that he has come to the region to ensure that human rights guarantees be respected by both Israel and the Palestinians as the peace process advances.
He demanded that both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ban policies that violate human rights.
Israel must ban the use of torture against all the detainees and revise open-fire guidelines established by the military, he said, adding that administrative detention must also be stopped and the Israeli authorities must ensure that the trials are fair.
Meanwhile, Sane demanded that the PNA halt methods of torture and put an end to arbitrary political arrests in the autonomous areas.
In addition, he made a request that the PNA stop unfair trials and abolish death penalty.
Sane and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday.
The delegation met with PNA President Yasser Arafat and four Palestinian Council members in the Gaza Strip Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Sane warned that human rights can not be ignored in the rush to attain peace.
He said that he was concerned that human rights issues are being pushed aside in favor of security concerns.
"When you look at the priorities of the various parties, their priority is peace, not human rights," he said.
