Serious human rights violations persist in Russia despite President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of 1998 as Russia's Year of Human Rights, Amnesty International said Monday.
Derek G. Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting with Russian media.
Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with the death penalty.
Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty because it did not want the expense of providing for life imprisonment for about 1,000 people.
``In other words, it is cheaper to kill,'' he said.
Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious objection to military service.
``While the Russian Federation's Constitution guarantees this right, no legislation has been enacted to create an alternative civilian service of non-punitive length,'' Evans said.
He also said that civilian prisoners in pre-trial detention were kept in conditions ``so severe as to constitute torture.''
Evans said Amnesty International has provided the government with a preliminary analysis of the human rights situation in Russia and some 51 proposals for meeting international standards.
