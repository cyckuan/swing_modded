judge who ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest is a director of a charity run by Amnesty International, the group campaigning for the former Chilean dictator to face charges of genocide and murder acknowledged Tuesday, while lobbyists stepped up pressure over Spain's request for his extradition.
Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' Pinochet supporters demonstrated outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office, and opponents planned a wreath-laying for victims of his secret police.
``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf of 700 families urging the government to block extradition of the 83-year-old general and send him home.
Controversy over links with Amnesty International of South African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffman was the latest twist in the tug-of-war over Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain who was arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant.
Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether extradition proceedings can go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 by five judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, against Pinochet.
He is awaiting Straw's decision under police guard in a rented mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
But Chile's government wants him back, partly to avoid exacerbating domestic tensions and threatening the country's newly built democracy.
Amnesty International said Hoffman, 64, an opponent of apartheid who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990 as the unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. which gets donations for work on human rights.
His wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary in Amnesty International's press office in London.
Hoffman and his wife had no involvement in the Pinochet campaign, said Amnesty International spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
She accused Pincohet supporters of trying to divert attention from the basic issue of whether he should be tried.
``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights organizations,'' Ms. Bermejo told the AP.
``In fact when Lord Hoffman was appointed to this case we saw him as being slightly unpredictable on a human rights,'' she added, noting that he recently ruled against a man who was sentenced to death sentence in the Bahamas, a former colony which still allows appeals to Britain's highest court.
In the Pinochet case, the five judges in an usual move allowed lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.
The judges included another native South African, Lord Johan Steyn, who also ruled against Pinochet.
