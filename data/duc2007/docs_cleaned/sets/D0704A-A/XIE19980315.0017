The Rwandan government has expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country.
The Rwandan government said that the London-based international human rights watchdog is siding with "genocidal" forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.
Amnesty International released a press statement on Friday in which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of civilians for the January-February period.
Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.
"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed, accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu hardliners.
For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty International is making up new reports shortly before the visit by the U.S. President Bill Clinton later this month.
"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists," Ndahiro alleged.
"It is totally unacceptable that at a time some people are trying to associate with Rwandans in the process of recovery from the aftermath of the genocide, Amnesty International is busy mud-slinging the Rwandan government," he noted.
