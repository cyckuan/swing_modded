The Tanzanian government today characterized the 1996 Amnesty International Report as biased and aimed at sowing seeds of hatred among the Tanzanian population.
This stand was included in a press release issued by the Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their personal and political ends.
The press release accused the Amnesty International of portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the accommodation of refugees.
On the allegation that there were acts of human rights violations in Zanzibar, the release deplored the organization's report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition party in Zanzibar without carrying any considerations or views of the government and the ruling party.
In conclusion, the press release of the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry said the Amnesty International report seriously lacks probity and in-depth scientific research, an absolute essential for the credibility of any presentation on social work.
