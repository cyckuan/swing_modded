Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti today expressed the hope that Amnesty International would in the future "be sensitive to Kenya's national sovereignty".
He noted that his government would not succumb to "recommendations which question Kenya's national sovereignty or are couched in the peremptory and prescriptive terms which are usually employed in master-servant relationship."
In response to a memorandum by Amnesty International on human rights situation in Kenya, the Kenyan leader told the visiting Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane that his government appreciated constructive criticism made in good faith.
The concerns raised in the memorandum cover a range of issues including constitutional reform, ordinary legislative reform and executive administration of laws.
Saitoti, who is also Minister of Planning and National Development, highlighted his government's commitment to upholding the doctrine of separation of powers, and termed as "fiction" of alleged executive interference of judiciary.
He underlined the independence of Kenya's judiciary, adding that a legal notice had been promulgated delinking the judiciary from the executive.
Referring to the constitutional reforms, the vice-president said that after the general elections this year, a commission would be appointed to review the Kenya constitution.
He pointed out that the government had appointed a task force to review public order and security laws including the preservation of public security act, the administration police act and the societies act.
The Kenyan government also appointed another task force to review the penal laws and procedure and both task forces are at work, he added.
The Kenyan leader said that President Daniel arap Moi pledged on June 1 that the public order act would be replaced by a peaceful assemblies act which would liberalize the exercise of the freedom of assembly.
