The Afghan Taliban Militia today criticized Amnesty International for interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs, said a report coming from Kabul.
The report quoted Amir Khan Muttaqi, minister of Information and Culture of the Taliban interim government in Kabul, as saying, "When the world says the Taliban shouldn't chop off hands of thieves, sentence murderers to death, and stone adulterers, it is interference in our internal affairs."
Muttaqi's comments followed a statement issued in London by Amnesty International that hundreds of Afghan people who sympathized with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were at risk of torture, ill-treatment or worse.
"It is clear that Taliban guards are busy implementing a reign of terror in Kabul," Amnesty International was quoted as saying.
Muttaqi noted that such criticism was "an aggression against Islam" and could not be tolerated.
In the new Islamic State of Afghanistan there will be no compromise to secular laws about penalties for crimes such as theft, murder and adultery, he said.
The Taliban captured the Afghan capital last Friday after three days of fighting with troops loyal to Rabbani.
