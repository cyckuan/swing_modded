Despite its human rights pledges, Britain's Labor Party government continues selling arms to countries such as Indonesia and Algeria, and seeks to deter political asylum seekers, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
The London-based organization said, too, that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is quick to condemn human rights abuses by nations with which this country has negligible trade, including Sudan, Iraq and Myanmar, while reluctant to act against important political and trading partners.
In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the United States criticized by Amnesty International for having the death penalty as countries that Britain treats delicately.
``Commercial and strategic interests often still dominate foreign policy,'' said Amnesty International.
``This has led to `constructive partnership' with countries involved in serious human rights abuses such as China and Saudi Arabia but clear public condemnation of abuses in countries of limited strategic importance such as Sudan and Myanmar,'' it added.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
However, Amnesty International said the Foreign Office has made real improvements since Labor defeated the Conservative Party government in May 1997 national elections.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook pledged soon afterward to put human rights ``at the heart of foreign policy.''
In an audit of Cook's pledge, Amnesty International praised Britain for, it said, seeking to set up an International Criminal Court in Rome, publishing an annual report on human rights, banning land mines, and taking ``limited measures'' to restrict arms sales to countries that may use them to commit human rights abuses.
However, the organization complained that since Labor took power, the Trade Department has granted 10 licenses for arms exports to Algeria, 10 for Colombia, 59 for Saudi Arabia, 64 for Indonesia and 146 for Turkey.
Trade Department spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said licenses were granted only after consultations with the Foreign Office and Defense Ministry.
Britain's total weapons trade with Indonesia is worth more than 200 million pounds (dlrs 320 million) a year.
On asylum seekers whose numbers have soared in recent years, including many seeking a better way of life, Amnesty International said genuine cases were regarded with grave skepticism by government officials.
``The principal message that the government is sending to those who flee persecution is to keep out of the United Kingdom,'' said the report.
