After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt smoothly Sunday morning.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon landed gently at 08:03 local time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the Kakhla Oasis 485 kilometers southwest of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
The 54-meter-high silver balloon floated over Mauritania Saturday past longitude 9 degrees west to complete the 41,841-kilometer-plus circumnavigation and set a record for an around-the-world voyage without a stop.
Piccard, a 41-year-old psychiatrist, and Jones, a 51-year-old instructor and grandfather, had intended to land near the pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, but unfavorable winds kept them southwest of their goal.
