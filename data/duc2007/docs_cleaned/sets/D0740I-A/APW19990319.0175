One of two exhausted balloonists trying to become the first to circle the globe nonstop sobbed with joy and relief Friday when he was told they have enough fuel to reach the finish line in Africa.
If all goes as planned, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and British adventurer Brian Jones will conquer one of the last great challenges in aviation on Saturday.
On Friday, their 180-foot-high Breitling Orbiter 3 was more than halfway across the Atlantic, being swept along by a jet stream at up to 100 mph.
Their control center in Geneva said they had gained about six hours and were on course to cross longitude 9 degrees west at about midday Saturday (7 a.m. EST).
That's the same line where they began their trip nearly three weeks ago.
At that point, the balloonists are expected to be above Mauritania, on Africa's northwest coast.
They plan to push on, over Algeria and Libya to Egypt, where they believe it will be easier to land and where Jones has long dreamed of ending the odyssey.
But if they're too tired, they will drift down in Mali, flight director Alan Noble said.
``If they want to put down in some part of the desert surrounded by lions, jackals and other dangerous animals, then we will do it,'' Noble said.
``But what we would dearly like to do is to get them down in Egypt near the pyramids.''
In a satellite telephone linkup, Piccard said he was using self-hypnosis to calm himself and cope with tension that has accumulated during the 19-day odyssey.
``There's a lot of stress,'' said Piccard, 41, who comes from a family of pioneers and is making his third round-the-world bid.
``It's really not a picnic.''
``It is right down to the wire,'' said Jones, a 51-year-old balloon instructor.
``Of course we're hopeful and we're secretly confident, but we can't sit back in our chairs and make the winds take us there.''
After weeks of frustrating delays, Piccard and Jones set off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
They drifted down to North Africa and then crossed toward Asia.
Unlike rival balloonists, the Breitling Orbiter crew had an advantage in that they got permission to pass over southern China, a move that saved them vital time.
They then picked up a fast jet stream over the Pacific before grinding to a near halt over Central America.
There the pilots developed breathing problems and got the shivers as their small cabin chilled to 46 degrees.
``We were very stressed and very cold,'' Piccard recounted.
``But now it's all going well again and we've put it behind us as a bad dream.''
The balloon finally picked up a jet stream again Thursday.
Early Friday, they beat the endurance record set two weeks ago by two British balloonists who later ditched in bad weather near Japan.
Once at its destination, the balloon probably will hover and make its final descent at dawn Sunday but a night landing was not out of the question, Noble said.
``We do have night vision goggles onboard, which are fairly powerful.
But the desert is not all sand dunes.
There are quite a few mansions there, which would be uncomfortable.''
