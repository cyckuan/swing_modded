The capsule that carried balloonists on the first nonstop hot air trip around the globe went on permanent display Thursday in the National Air and Space Museum, next to the Wright brothers' plane and the craft that carried man to the moon.
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon.
It rests at ground level in the ``Milestones of Flight'' gallery, adjacent to the Wright brothers' Flyer, Charles Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' Chuck Yeager's supersonic Bell X-1 and the Apollo 11 command module.
Officials from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, an international aeronautics body, also presented Piccard and Jones with papers certifying three world records: distance, duration and shortest time around the world.
``It's almost like a circle has been closed, has been finished.''
Jones expressed amazement at their accomplishment and new honor.
``When people use our names in the same sentence as John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and the Wright brothers, we still tend to look over our shoulders to see who they're talking about.
There is a sense of disbelief which pervades still and, I think, will last a long time,'' he said.
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, an English balloonist, began their journey March 1, lifting away from the village of Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland.
They headed south, caught favorable winds around the equator and circled the Earth from west to east in 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes.
They landed March 21 in the Egyptian desert.
While the crew's computers showed they traveled 29,056 miles, the federation determined that they had traveled 25,361 miles after subtracting twists and turns.
During the trip, the balloonists lived in a pill-shaped pressurized compartment the size of a minivan, flying as high as 36,000 feet and moving at up to 105 mph.
The gondola contains a galley, two bunks, a toilet and the instruments and controls to operate the balloon.
Some of the cylinders that carried the liquid propane used to heat the balloon's 181-foot-tall envelope still hang on the outside.
The velope itself is too big to be displayed.
Instead, the public will see a piece of it.
Other pieces will be displayed in museums around the world.
Piccard and Jones have already received another reward for their record-breaking journey: Anheuser-Busch Cos., the beer brewer, paid them $1 million for becoming the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon.
They said they will use some of the money to start the Winds of Hope Foundation, which will award prizes each March 21 to those who are committed, in Piccard's words, to ``fighting against forgotten sufferances.''
