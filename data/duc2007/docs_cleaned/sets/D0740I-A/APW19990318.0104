Fatigued and chilled but exhilarated by their success, two adventurers soared over the Dominican Republic on the back of strengthening winds in a final push to become the first balloonists to circle the globe nonstop.
Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1.
``If we could only find a fast jet stream and whiz across the Atlantic, that would be great,'' Brian Smith, a flight controller, said from a control tower in Geneva.
It was traveling at 83 mph.
``They had a low day yesterday when they slowed down and things didn't look very good.
Today it's very positive, they've got better winds than (had been) forecast,'' said Jones' wife, Joanna, working a 14-hour day at the control center.
She said the team was over the Domincan Republic and preparing for the Atlantic crossing.
Despite thermal underwear, the pilots were shivering in the balloon's cabin, where the temperature was 46 degrees.
The team raced across the Pacific in six days and scooted over Mexico on Wednesday, with winds pushing them to speeds of 115 mph.
But they slowed after being ejected from the jet stream and started to drift.
``It's been a tiring day, one of the most difficult,'' Smith said Wednesday.
He added that the balloonists ``have been fantastic, fatigued but in very good spirits.''
Despite concerns about communications and fuel consumption, Smith said the pilots were confident they would make it to North Africa and complete the trip.
The Anheuser-Busch brewery company of St. Louis is offering $500,000 to the first balloonists to make it around the world, and an equal amount to the charity of the winners' choice.
In their first attempt at circumnavigating the world, the two have beat the record set last year by American millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden.
The three ditched their balloon off Hawaii in December after flying 13,751 miles, more than halfway around the globe.
Early today, the chances of Jones and Piccard flying all the way to Egypt's pyramids, as Jones had hoped to do, appeared ``quite improbable,'' Smith said.
The pilots now hope to land further west, in Morocco.
If the two make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last great tests facing balloonists.
