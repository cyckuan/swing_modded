Three Europeans were preparing Wednesday to set off from Switzerland in the quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon, spokesman Gerard Sermier said.
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II.
The balloonists' plan is to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on Saturday.
From there, they hope to ride jetstreams that should move them along in an east-bound direction at around 200 kilometers an hour at 10,000 meters.
If luck holds, Brietling Orbiter II will complete its globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who plans to set off from Morocco in a few days in a rival attempt to circle the world, wished the Brietling Orbiter II team good luck.
