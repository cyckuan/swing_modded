pair of British balloonists trying to circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they crossed the path of a Boeing 747.
Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet over the South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner radioed a request to approach the balloon, the team's London spokesmen said.
The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of windows and snapping pictures.
``It was an amazing sight for us, particularly seeing so many friendly faces smiling at us after only having each other to stare at during the past 16 days,'' Elson was quoted as saying.
Neither the pilots nor ground control could identify the airline.
By Friday, the two were over the Taiwan Straits southeast of the China coast, heading for northern Japan and a jet stream they hope will catapult them across the Pacific to British Columbia.
With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them, the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North America and in about two weeks' time to become the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world.
Their Cable and Wireless balloon, which launched from Spain on Feb. 17, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft.
Prescot and Elson have been painstakingly negotiating the winds of North Africa, the Indian subcontinent and south Asia to avoid being drawn into China, which has denied them permission to fly through its air space.
An Anglo-Swiss team of balloonists, meanwhile, picked up altitude and speed over Africa's Sahara Desert after chipping off icicles that weighed down the craft and wasted fuel.
Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Brian Jones climbed out of the hi-tech gondola of the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to break off some of the icicles with an ice pick on Thursday.
