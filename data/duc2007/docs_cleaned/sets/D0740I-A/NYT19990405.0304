The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21, has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane, which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever made around the world.
The Breitling was built in England, financed and registered in Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and Brian Jones, who is British.
The pilots completed their three-week trip when they landed in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055 miles.
No previous attempts came even close.
Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn.
``The Breitling Orbiter 3 will take its place with the Voyager aircraft and with the Winnie May, the airplane in which Wiley Post made a series of solo flights taking him completely around the world,'' he said.
For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to charities.
The Breitling company, a maker of specialty watches, announced that the balloon and its crew capsule would be exhibited in Switzerland until mid-July at the Lucerne Transport Museum.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
Parts of the balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
Breitling spokesman said the entire balloon crew, including the pilots and Alan Noble, the mission director, would arrive in New York City Tuesday to begin a tour of the United States.
