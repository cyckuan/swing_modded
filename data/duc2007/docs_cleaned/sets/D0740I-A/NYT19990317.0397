The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however, the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west longitude.
But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before fuel runs out.
The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya, where they are uncertain of the political climate.
When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around the world.
Thus, 9.27 degrees west longitude represents the finish line.
If the Breitling team makes it, they will enter the record books as winners of the last great goal of ballooning.
Many have tried before them but all have fallen far short, including the roughly 20 attempts made during the last decade alone.
Only last week a British balloon, the Cable Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his co-pilot, Brian Jones, a 52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company.
Two years ago the company offered the prize and a trophy, the Budweiser Cup, to the first balloonist to circle the world nonstop.
Gregory Hendricks, a Budweiser spokesman, said Wednesday the challenge remained in effect, and, he added: ``We're wishing good luck to the Breitling crew.''
Besides the vagaries of wind direction and speed, there were storms to avoid and regions of dead air where the balloon might have become stuck until fuel ran out.
There were many technical problems, including the accumulation of ice on the propane burners.
Worst of all, some of the nations along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to balloons and had to be avoided.
China gave last-minute permission, but only on condition that the balloon remain south of the 26th parallel.
Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling sped at more than 100 miles an hour.
On two occasions, prompted partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
Wednesday, Piccard reported that he and Jones had been having trouble sleeping.
In his psychiatric work Piccard frequently uses hypnosis and is adept at hypnotizing himself to fall asleep.
But the technique apparently failed during the last few exhausting days.
