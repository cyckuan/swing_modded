The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week.
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said.
They are expected to fly over the ocean for six days instead of hugging the Asian coastline and hitting North America farther north.
``What frightens us most about crossing the Pacific is bad weather in an area where rescue will be long and possibly difficult,'' the control center quoted Jones as saying.
``I'm just hoping we won't bump into any bad weather.''
Piccard and Jones were flying at 55 mph at an altitude of 26,200 feet.
They have covered about than 12,000 miles since taking off March 1 from the Swiss Alps.
The control center said the balloonists were so concerned about the Pacific they didn't take time to celebrate crossing China, one of the major hurdles of their trip.
The Chinese allowed them to pass through a narrow strip and reminded them three times during the 14-hour crossing that they were sometimes less than 25 miles from the no-fly zone.
Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval.
British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson gave up over the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they lacked Chinese permission.
