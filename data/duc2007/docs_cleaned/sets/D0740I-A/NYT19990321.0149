After a final night soaring across North Africa, the first balloonists to circle the globe touched down early Sunday morning in the soft sands of southern Egypt and then spent hours waiting for a ride home.
The landing, some 300 miles southwest of Cairo, brought a bumpy end to a record-setting journey that had lasted nearly three weeks.
The balloonists, aboard the huge Breitling Orbiter 3, had hoped to land to near the Pyramids of Giza, but unfavorable winds kept them from that storybook ending.
Instead, they scuttled to a stop in the sands of the Sahara, after two aborted attempts, and then had to gouge holes in their still-inflated balloon to keep it from dragging them further across the desolate desert.
Dr. Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Brian Jones, a Briton, landed just after 8 a.m. local time.
Then, after 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes aloft, they spent seven hours on a lonely desert plateau before an Egyptian army helicopter arrived to pick them up.
Speaking to reporters in the oasis town of Dakhla, Jones said the flight ``was the most amazing experience.''
Both men appeared elated by their achievement, yet drained by the effort and the endurance it took to claim the elusive prize of having circled the world in a balloon.
``If you ask me now whether I'd do it again, I'd say no,'' Jones said.
``But ask me later.''
Both men said they became firm friends during the trip, squeezed into a capsule that measured just 16{ by 10 feet.
``In several stages, we were able to support each other,'' Piccard, a psychiatrist, said at a news conference in Cairo Sunday night.
``When one of us was about to give up, the other would support him.''
Jones said the worst thing was enduring the cold.
``All of our water froze at night, so we waited till day to fill the kettles,'' he said.
``It was very, very cold up there.''
Piccard added, speaking of the trials and tribulations of the flight: ``It was not a matter of setting records; it was a fabulous metaphor of life.
To try is the only way to survive.''
The pair completed their circumnavigation on Saturday, crossing an invisible line in the air far above Mauritania.
After a trip that took them across North Africa, South Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Central America and the Atlantic, they decided to push on, in search of a soft landing and the romance of the 5,000-year-old Pyramids one of the world's most enduring symbols of human perseverance.
The two men said that the hours they spent in the desert had given them time to reflect on their experience and to appreciate the extraordinary diversity of the bleak habitat that surrounded them.
``We are not heroes,'' Jones said in Cairo.
``We just proved that dreams could come true.''
It was not clear why it had taken so long for Egyptian helicopters to recover the two intrepid balloonists, whose plans to speak at a news conference in Cairo were postponed for hours because of the delay.
Their landing, timed to take advantage of a postdawn lull in desert winds, was observed by mission controllers aboard a chartered plane, and their exact location was pinpointed by the global positioning satellite system.
In Dakhla, where they answered journalists' questions, the pair appeared drawn and thin.
Asked about the state of their balloon, Jones who, like Piccard, wore a blue flight suit and was sipping soda from a wine glass said: ``It's completely deflated, like me, really.''
Members of the record-setting team described the landing as having been ``a 10'' on a scale of 1 to 10, and they said that weather conditions had been perfect.
The team's fuel supplies were near empty when they landed, team members said, and there was no question of the pair continuing on for another night.
But Jones, a 51-year-old former member of the British air force, described a scene that sounded somewhat more chaotic, with strong winds tipping the balloon over after the landing.
``We had to run around the balloon with our knives to make holes to keep from being dragged across the desert,'' Jones told reporters in Dakhla.
The Egyptian government spokesman, Nabil Osman, said that the weather-driven changes in plans for the balloon's landing had slowed the military's plans for swift recovery of the crew.
``There was no delay,'' Osman said.
``It was a combination of how to react and how to get the helicopters to that area.''
The huge silver balloon, 180 feet tall, landed atop a remote, plateau about 45 miles north of the desert town of Mut.
Overnight, Egyptian security and tourism officials had advised people across Egypt that they had nothing to fear from the craft that would descend from the skies.
The record-setting mission had received little attention here through most of the long journey.
But the prospect of a landing near the Pyramids which would had made for extraordinary publicity galvanized the government into action.
