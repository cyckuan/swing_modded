Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world.
Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon will take off from Chateau d'Oex, in the Swiss Alps, as soon after Nov. 25 as weather conditions are favorable, they said.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world.
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
The balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
But the team has already received conditional permission from China for this attempt, flight director Alan Noble told a news conference in Geneva.
This will be the last flight sponsored by Swiss watchmaker Breitling, he added.
The balloon's route should take it across the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China and Japan before crossing the Pacific and North America and returning to Europe, a three-week journey of some 26,700 kilometers (16,600 miles).
Piccard said he believed the two men would work well together in the cramped conditions of the balloon's cabin.
``We are very different.
There will be Tony, there will be me, and there will be both of us together,'' he said.
Two of the Breitling team's challengers, Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are joining forces for their own latest attempt.
In August, Fossett broke his own distance record, traveling more than 24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles) before a storm damaged his balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.
