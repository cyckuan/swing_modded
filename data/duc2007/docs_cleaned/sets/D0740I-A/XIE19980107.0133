Swiss, Belgium and British team aiming to set a round-the-world ballooning record have delayed their start by 24 hours to Friday to take advantage of more favourable winds, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
"The weather is perfect for Friday," Christine Zwingmann said.
The team, composed of Bertrand Piccard, Wim Verstraeten and Andy Elson had been due to lift-off from Chateau d'oex in the Swiss alps on Thursday morning.
However, winds announced for Friday seem to be better, Zwingmann said.
British entrepreneur Richard Branson has declared his bid to jump into the race again in mid-January after an aborted mission in December.
