Swiss-English balloon team soared over Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to travel nonstop around the world.
``So, that little puddle is what they call the Pacific,'' Brian Jones of England deadpanned in a message sent to the team's support crew in Geneva.
The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as the balloon approached the Mexican coast.
``We're pleased that the Pacific is now behind them,'' flight controller Brian Smith said.
Jones and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, who lifted off from the Swiss Alps on March 1, were over Belize in Central America this morning.
They were heading into the Caribbean toward Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, the control center said in a statement.
The team will try to pick up a stream over the eastern Caribbean by Friday and then head for North Africa.
Saturday afternoon.
If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
``If I get there, I really won't be able to believe it,'' Piccard told Swiss Television.
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were forced to ditch their balloon off Hawaii on Dec. 25 after flying around more than half the globe.
U.S.-Australian team canceled its planned attempt in mid-January.
On March 7, two British balloonists abandoned their attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan.
Smith said Piccard and Jones set a record on Tuesday, breaking the old mark for longest distance flown in a balloon: 14,236 miles.
The Pacific crossing was sluggish at first, with the Breitling Orbiter balloon slowing at times to 30 mph.
But the team managed to catch a ride on the jetstream southeast of Hawaii.
The balloonists cruised over Mexico at 53 mph at an altitude of 36,000 feet, their control center reported.
The center said the speed helped conserve propane, which fuels the burners in the lower, hot-air section of the balloon.
The burners are needed to keep the balloon afloat.
The center said it still is unable to predict where the balloon will land if it reaches North Africa, but that it probably won't make it as far as the pyramids, where Jones had hoped to come down It said predictions of the landing spot will probably begin Thursday and will get progressively more accurate.
