Three Europeans set off Wednesday from Switzerland in the latest quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon, organizers said.
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard Breitling Orbiter II.
Their 53-meter-high combined helium and hot-air balloon slowly lifted off at 9:55 a.m. (0855 GMT) in cold, calm air with 5,000 spectators on hand to wish it a safe journey.
It briefly descended, but rose again when the crew dropped ballast from their bright orange pressurized basket.
The balloonists' plan was to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on Saturday.
Brietling Orbiter II is scheduled to complete its globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
