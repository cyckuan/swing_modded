Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown.
Brown stood down by mutual agreement after differences between the pilots emerged, ``particularly in the area of crew resource management,'' it added.
The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions are favorable.
The team says it is technically ready to fly.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Four other teams, including a combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco.
The other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and Albuquerque, N.M. Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.
An offer by Brown to give technical expertise and advice during the balloon's flight has been accepted, the Breitling team said.
