Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect previously agreed conditions.
The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday.
It would be Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Beijing originally gave British tycoon Branson, Chicago millionaire Fossett and Lindstrand, of Sweden, permission to cross China below 26 degrees north latitude.
The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday.
After diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left China as quickly as possible.
Caught in poor weather conditions, the team splashed down off Hawaii Friday.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs, Australia.
