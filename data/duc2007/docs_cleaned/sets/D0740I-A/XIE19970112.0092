Swiss-Belgian team took off from a lake-side mountain in the Swiss Alps Sunday in the latest bid to balloon non-stop around the world, according to reports from Chateau D'oex, Switzerland.
Swiss Bertrand Piccard and his Belgian team-member Wim Verstraeten lifted off this morning in the Breitling Orbiter from Chateau D'oex above Lake Geneva for a journey aimed at circumnavigating Earth.
The round world trip is expected to take about two weeks.
Rival Branson, who owns the British Virgin Group, was on hand here to wish his competitors well.
His own bid to fly around the world non-stop in 18 days was scuttled last Wednesday due to a technical hitch.
