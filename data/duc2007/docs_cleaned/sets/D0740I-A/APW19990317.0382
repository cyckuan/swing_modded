Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts.
By a 22-18 party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing defense, education and several other programs.
Simultaneously, the Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan.
That panel planned to complete its work tomorrow.
