Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in China's agriculture and food production.
The total output of China 's organic food was up to 8.4 million tons by the end of 1998.
The sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan (about 3.3 billion US dollars).
The rapid development of China's organic food industry has attracted the international attention.
In 1998, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United Nations emphasized China's experiences of development and management of organic food in the Asia-Pacific region.
Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with great potential.
It is estimated that in the coming years, the scale of the world's organic food market will reach 100 billion US dollars and Europe, the United States and Japan will take the lead.
In China, the average consumption of fruit and vegetables is still far behind that of developed countries, thus it has a good opportunity to develop organic food, Liu said.
