During the 90-day comment period that followed, it became clear just how badly the department had stumbled.
Rather than heed the advice of its own National Organic Standards Board, the agency would have allowed the use of irradiation, sewage sludge and genetically modified organisms in the growing and preparation of foods to be called organic.
Whatever one thinks of those particular practices, they are hardly what most people would consider ``organic.''
The outcry from consumers and organic farmers forced reconsideration.
On Tuesday the agency released a Revised Proposed Rule.
It is a dramatically improved document that may signal a significant new direction at Agriculture.
To quote the department's own press release, the new rule ``specifically prohibits the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation in the production of food products labeled `organic.'''
It also offers a strict standard defining what constitutes an organic food, a step that should do a great deal to enhance consumer trust that a food labeled organic really is organic.
For raw products to be deemed 100 percent organic, for example, they must be grown or manufactured without added hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
The new rules do not reflect a judgment on the relative safety or quality of organic foods as compared with conventional foods.
Rather, they govern marketing claims.
The department's response to the community of organic farmers may herald a welcome new sensitivity to a sector of the farming world that has suffered from official neglect.
The Clinton administration now needs to approve a final rule before it leaves office.
The Agriculture Department should take what it has learned in developing these regulations especially the act of listening intently to farmers and apply it to other programs that affect small farmers.
For their part, consumers and farmers should recognize the power they wield when they work together.
