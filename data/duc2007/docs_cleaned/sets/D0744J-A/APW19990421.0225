It's a marriage aimed at putting fish on the table of the world's rich and poor for generations to come.
``We're in the business of saving fish so we can eat them,'' said British lawmaker John Gummer, chairman of the Marine Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit organization which unveiled the seal and announced the first independent global standard to certify fisheries on Tuesday.
According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, about 60 percent of the world's 200 most valuable fish species are either depleted, overfished or only slowly recovering.
Some species, such as the Atlantic halibut and the bluefin tuna, have been fished to the brink of extinction.
The spawning of bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic has fallen by nearly 90 percent since 1975, the council said.
At the Tsukigi fish market in Japan, the bluefin can go for the $60,000 and cost $200 a plate at the sushi bar.
The aim of the council's campaign, which already has backing from more than 200 corporate, government and voluntary organizations around the world, is to get ``market power behind the battle to save our fishing stocks,'' Gummer said.
The turquoise-and-white logo will begin to appear later this year in Europe and North America on fish products, restaurant menus, and advertisements.
Boston-based Legal Sea Foods, a seafood processor and restaurant company, and Shaw's Supermarkets which has 127 stores in the six New England States.
Whole Foods Market Inc., based in Austin, Texas, which has 92 stores around the country selling gourmet and organic food, also signed.
``If the fish supply is no longer sustainable, then Legal Sea Foods as a business is no longer sustainable,'' said Roger Berkowitz, the company's president and chief executive officer.
``We can't suddenly switch gears and sell poultry or meat.''
The London-based council was the brainchild of Unilever, one of the world's largest buyers of frozen fish, and the World Wide Fund for Nature, who wanted to bring together public and private-sector efforts to reverse the crisis from overfishing and pollution.
Since the council was established in 1997, he said, it has consulted fishermen and experts around the world to come up with a global standard for fisheries that will augment existing local, national and international laws, standards and agreements.
To receive council certification, fisheries must be well-managed, maintain and replenish healthy fish stocks, and preserve the surrounding ecosystem.
``We will be certifying quality fish caught in a way which doesn't endanger future fishing,'' Gummer said.
