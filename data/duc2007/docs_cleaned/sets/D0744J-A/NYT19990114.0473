That meat will be the only organic food with a certification process approved by the federal government.
State regulations for years have allowed organic labels on many other foods, but meat and poultry have always been in a different category, subject to more stringent federal labeling regulations.
The federal rules go into effect immediately, and need no legislative approval.
They are welcomed by companies that grow organic meat, who have been frustrated in attempts to market a premium product.
Many foods labeled organic sell for 10 percent to 50 percent above the price of similar nonorganic foods.
For decades, the Agriculture Department treated the organic food industry as if it did not exist.
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food.
The proposal met with stiff resistance from more than 275,000 people who said they opposed the federal standards because they would lower the state standards already in place.
In an unusual move the agency withdrew the proposal.
An Agriculture Department spokesman described the new meat and poultry policy as ``an interim step,'' until national standards exist, which may come next year.
``This is a boon for small companies like us,'' said Allen Shainsky, owner of Petaluma Poultry Processors in Petaluma, Calif. Shainsky's company sells around 120,000 birds per week, and he said he hoped to be selling 15,000 organic birds a week within a few months.
Allen Moody, a feed coordinator for the Coulee Region Organic Produce Pool, or Cropp, in LaFarge, Wis., which sells its products under the Organic Valley label, said: ``This means a lot to us.
We have not been able to get full value out of our beef cattle, our dairy cattle.
``In terms of going out with a national marketing program, it has been impossible, and we have not been able to realize the true value of our animal production,'' Moody said.
``It has held the livestock industry back.''
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.
The current price is 28 cents a pound for live hogs, compared with 35 cents last year.
Ultimately, Moody said, there is more profit in organic meat than in conventional meat.
He said he expected to sell organic pork for 60 to 70 cents a pound.
The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label.
Those standards require third-party certification that the meat and poultry are raised on organic feed, without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, that they have access to the outside and that there is a manure management plan.
If an animal becomes ill and must be given antibiotics it can no longer be sold as organic.
The secretary has seen that this will create new opportunities to help small farmers.''
Glickman acted after a letter-writing campaign in the fall from small meat and poultry producers.
Opposition from the national beef industry was quite mild.
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Association, said the association was ``generally supportive of niche marketing and giving consumers a choice.''
Our only concern, Ms. Harrison said, ``is that consumers understand that products labeled organic are not safer than products that are not labeled organic.''
