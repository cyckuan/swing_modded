But they cannot tell just how much, because the United States, unlike many other countries, does not require the labeling of gene-modified food.
Most consumers are unaware of the amount of genetically engineered food that is available, making it difficult to judge their resistance to such products.
When the government granted Monsanto Co. permission to sell rBGH, recombinant bovine growth hormone, which increases cows' milk production, and milk containing a gene-altered hormone went on sale, some states and several dairies tried to label their products as free of the hormone.
Monsanto threatened to take them to court.
Some capitulated.
But a number of dairy products are now labeled to show that they do not contain rBGH.
With only a few consumer groups seeking wider labeling, the greatest awareness of genetically engineered food comes from the organic-food industry.
Whole Foods Market Inc. of Austin, Texas, which has 91 supermarkets in 18 states, requires its suppliers to guarantee that none of the products they sell to the company have gene-altered ingredients.
Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations.
The inclusion of genetically modified food was one of the reasons most often cited, and the proposal was withdrawn.
On Jan. 1 the government gave the green light to genetically modified soybeans, cotton, corn, summer squash, potatoes, canola oil, radicchio, papayas and tomatoes.
The amount of genetically modified soybeans, cotton and corn on the market is significant.
According to one study, the gene-altered corn crop in the United States this summer is estimated to be 32 percent of the total, for soybeans 38 percent and for canola oil, from Canada, 58 percent.
There is no estimate for cotton.
There are no figures for the smaller crops like papaya and radicchio, and just because a crop has approval does not mean that it is being sold.
But within a year or two such crops are quite likely to be available.
The Consumers Union, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Center for Science in the Public Interest are among those pushing for labeling.
Norway and India are leading the fight to require the strictest labeling on all foods.
And virtually all European Union countries want some labeling for gene-altered food.
``Many products made abroad,'' Ms. Goldberg said, ``will be labeled, and in order for the United States to sell food products abroad we may have to label them.''
