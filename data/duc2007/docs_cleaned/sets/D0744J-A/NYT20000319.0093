There was a time, not too long ago, when you were a fine pet owner as long as you fed your pet table scraps or chow, took it to the vet when necessary, and maybe bought a latex toy for it to chew on.
Today, you would border on negligence.
The pet owner of today, according to a growing number of health-conscious animal lovers, should provide organic food, nutritional supplements, interactive toys and videos, and holistic remedies such as acupuncture, massage and aromatherapy.
Over the past 15 years or so, an entire industry has sprung up to supply organic nutrition and holistic care to pets.
``Supermarket pet food is full of crap,'' says Norma Otero, the manager at Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, a 13-year-old store in the East Village.
``Would you want to eat road kill and factory byproducts?
Why would you give that to your pet?
Even a human can eat my food.''
Whiskers sells organic, all-natural pet foods.
The list of ingredients on any package of food reads like a regular grocery list: chicken, corn, carrots ...
There are no chemical ingredients ending in ``-ide'' or ``-ate,'' which appear frequently on most of the lists on most processed pet foods.
Feeding a pet those processed foods all the time ``is like giving your kid Trix versus Grape Nuts or Cheerios,'' says Amy Shapiro, owner of two natural pet stores, the eight-year-old Barking Zoo in Chelsea and the newly opened Another Barking Zoo in Tribeca.
But advocates for natural pets disagree about premium brands such as Iams and Hill's Science Diet.
Barking Zoos carry them, but Whiskers does not, because they are processed.
``They do OK with that food,'' says Dr. Roger Valentine, a Los Angeles veterinarian who specializes in cats.
``But when people switch to those premium brands after having their cat on organic food, the cats get dandruff and loose stools and hairballs and things like that.''
But Valentine says there is not enough data to say that cats on organic food are actually living longer.
Lara Strazdin, manager of public relations for Iams Co., isn't persuaded, either.
``We have not seen any studies that show organic foods are better than non-organic,'' she says.
``If we did see that, then honestly, we would switch.''
Iams is processed, but it considers itself all-natural, because it has no artificial preservatives, no color or flavor enhancers, and no salt or sugar.
Officials at Hill's Pet Nutrition, maker of Science Diet, did not return calls seeking comment.
But these days, the conscientious pet owner has to consider much more than food.
Owners also have an array of pet vitamins and food supplements to choose from, which aid digestion, improve the health of skin and fur, repel pests and prevent urinary, kidney and liver problems.
There are special foods for pets with injuries, diabetes, allergies or weak immune systems, and heart, kidney or gastrointestinal problems.
``There's been tremendous growth in the industry in the last 10-15 years,'' says Shapiro.
``So many people are inventing new products and gadgets.
More people are finding that the pet market is a viable marketplace.''
In part, the success of this market is braced by the strong economy.
More Americans than ever can afford extras for their pets.
In addition, people have grown more knowledgeable and open to healthy living and alternative medicine in general.
But the biggest boon to the pet industry may be the Internet.
``The Net has done wonders,'' Shapiro says.
As people have gone online to research their own health and alternative medicines in particular, pet owners have also educated themselves about pet-care options on hundreds of informational Web sites.
Many pet stores now have online outlets, so for people who don't live near a Whiskers or a Barking Zoo, natural pet supplies are just several clicks away.
But while the Internet has helped build awareness and a customer base for natural pet supplies, some store owners see a downside.
Shapiro says she appreciates the added business from her online customers, but worries that independent pet stores are getting squeezed out by big online outlets such as pets.com and petopia.com.
The local stores have one important advantage.
Pets and owners can visit them on their walks.
Inside, people can see how certain products go over with their pets before buying.
Aside from the myriad food choices, there are organic bones and treats as an alternative to rawhide, which Otero says is difficult to digest and contains bleach and glue.
There is a cat litter, World's Best, made from 100 percent kernel corn, which is recommended because it is flushable and the cat will digest it easily if it licks the litter off its paws afterward.
There are books and videos on alternative pet therapies, such as acupuncture, Chinese and Western herbology, massage, aromatherapy, color therapy and homeopathy.
So how much will it cost you to become a natural pet owner?
13-ounce can of organic dog food costs up to $3.99 at Whiskers, while a same-sized can of Friskies' Alpo costs 69 cents at RiteAid.
In the long run, ``It may be more expensive, but your pet is healthier and happier, and you'll spend less at the vet,'' says Shapiro, who owns a greyhound.
Customers agree.
``It's a big expense,'' admits Noel Canfield, who has shopped for her seven cats at Whiskers ever since it opened.
She used to buy processed cat food, but after she lost a cat to cancer, she started studying what was in the food and switched to organic.
``It's been worth it because no one's been really sick in my cat family,'' she said.
``It boosts their immune system.
I'm a nurse, and I feel like I'm being a good parent, if you will.''
In addition, she says, organic food looks and smells better.
After all, money spent on pets is really spent on owners.
People see pets as benefits to their own health.
Recent studies say pets lower stress and blood pressure.
Some hospitals are even using pet-facilitated therapies.
``People are valuing animals more than ever, and want to take care of them,'' says Canfield.
