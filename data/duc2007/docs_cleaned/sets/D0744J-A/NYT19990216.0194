And he doesn't care what it takes.
Four years ago, he said that organic food could not feed the world without destroying the environment.
Now, he says it's lethal.
In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine, published by his employer, the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, Avery wrote, ``Organic foods have clearly become the deadliest food choice.''
This is the case, he said, because organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit pasteurization.
The last assertion is untrue, as were several other statements in the article.
The accusation might have gone unnoticed, but excerpts from the article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to be picked up around the country, by The Associated Press, The Tampa Tribune and trade industry publications.
The simplest definition of ``organic'' is food grown without hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
Avery, however, used the terms ``organic,'' ``free-range,'' ``natural'' and ``unpasteurized'' interchangeably.
``But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in terms of public health.''
His most combative accusation is based, he said, on 1996 data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing that ``people who eat organic and `natural' foods are eight times as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly new strain of E. coli bacteria (O157:H7).''
Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak, which he called organic, were not, like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
Avery's claim that ``consumers of organic food are also more likely to be attacked by a relatively new, more virulent strain of the infamous salmonella bacteria'' was based on a Consumers Union study in 1998 showing that ``premium'' chickens had higher levels of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens.
But the premium chickens were not organic.
In the article, Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to task for failing ``to issue any warnings to consumers about the higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in organic foods.''
In the interview, he said that that assertion was based on a statement by Dr. Robert Lake, an official in the agency's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.
Lake denied making such a statement, saying, ``We don't go out of our way to sample organic food, and hence I don't think we are in a position to say anything one way or another about it.''
Avery wrote that because ``organic farmers use animal manure as the major source of fertilizer,'' there are higher levels of harmful bacteria in organic food.
Katherine DiMatteo, the executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must be followed for safety.
Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7.''
His real goal, he said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically,'' he said.
The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried.
