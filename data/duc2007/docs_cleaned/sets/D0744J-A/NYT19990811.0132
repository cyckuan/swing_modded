And although whole foods have long had a place with the Birkenstocks and mantra crowd, today's consumer is more likely to drive a Suburban than a VW bus.
Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.
And the meaning of ``natural'' has morphed to include exotics: cheeses, butters and fish and varieties of vegetables we only read about 30 years ago.
