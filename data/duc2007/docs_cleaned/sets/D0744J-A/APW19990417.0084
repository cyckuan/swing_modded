Consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores.
Today, with more organic choices than ever, from beef to baby food, and with more markets stocking the goods, organic is going mainstream.
Stores are selling meats and poultry products carrying organic labels, which the Agriculture Department approved in January.
Last month, food giant General Mills introduced its organic cereal, Sunrise.
Organic vegetables and fruits, already well known to consumers, now are being used in a variety of products, including baby food.
For years organic foods were bit players in the food industry.
``In the last few years, when you talk about organic, usually it's lettuce, vegetables, fruit,'' said Bob Scowcroft, executive director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
``You devote your life to this and it's just hard to envision.
Overnight, it's the ad in the middle of the evening news.''
Analysts say the organic industry is growing at least 20 percent each year in the last five years, with overall 1997 sales of about $4.2 billion.
The increased demand has caught the attention of the estimated 5,300 farmers growing organic products, Scowcroft said.
Each day, his office hears from dozens of farmers wanting information about making the transition to organic.
``The quantity that General Mills is buying and their projected expansion .
.
The new Sunrise cereal contains organic whole wheat, corn, oats and barley as well as organic sugar, said Scott Lutz, vice president for new enterprises at General Mills.
``One of the bigger challenges was to make sure there was an ample supply of organic grains and organic sugar,'' Lutz said.
The company spent about four years developing the product.
``The reaction has been very positive,'' Lutz said.
``We've been hearing from consumers for quite some time that they wanted another choice.
We tried to make organic cereals accessible to the mainstream.''
Consumers will also benefit from the introduction of organic meat in stores across the country, activists say.
Organically-grown meat typically comes from animals that have been fed vegetarian diets free of pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics.
The animals are also free range, meaning they are able to roam and are not confined to small pens that sometimes house hundreds of animals.
In a much-anticipated announcement, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman in January said the agency would allow meat to be certified and labeled as organic.
Many in the industry had complained that it was unfair to allow vegetables, fruits and milk to be labeled organic, while placing restraints on the meat industry.
California-based Petaluma Poultry, which has marketed antibiotic-free chicken for several years, plans to introduce its Rosie the Organic Chicken next week to consumers in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based company that has marketed vegetables and milk, already offers frozen hot dogs and hamburger patties.
In June, Organic Valley plans to introduce the first organic bacon and ham as well as whole organic chicken and chicken breasts.
The fresh products first will be marketed in the Midwest while the frozen items will be distributed nationally, said Theresa Marquez, Organic Valley's marketing director.
Allen Shainsky, president of Petaluma Poultry, said if the growth of his company's antibiotic-free chicken line is any indication of what is in store for organic, the industry should do well.
``We've seen the reaction to our antibiotic free business become bigger and bigger,'' Shainsky said.
``You hear how everyone wants organic.
We'll see how well we're received.''
