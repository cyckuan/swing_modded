In a reversal, the government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday.
The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too permissive.
``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to protect the integrity of your industry,'' said Keith Jones of the Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program.
The department is developing the first national standards on organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.
In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion.
Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming Research Foundation said.
Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government.
For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides, herbicides or preservatives.
Livestock should be raised in open-air environments, without antibiotics or hormones.
Last year the organic farmers defeated USDA proposals to allow irradiation, genetic engineering and sewage sludge in organic production.
The original rules also would have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry groups.
Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw the proposal and try again.
Jones shared key details of the department's latest proposals Thursday with the nation's largest gathering of organic farmers at the Ecological Farming Conference.
Holding a hand-drawn paper target to his chest, he conceded that the federal agency has failed the organic farmers in the past.
``It seems that in the current environment the USDA can't do anything right,'' he said.
``But I can tell you today we have a commitment to get it right.''
He got a generally sympathetic reception.
``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is on the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers.
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's attention.''
However, some farmers were skeptical that his verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again.
``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but we still believe in it.
That's kind of where we are in this process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. ``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,'' said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a Santa Fe, N.M. company.
``For many of us, this is a continuation of a lifetime of work.
First it was civil rights.
Then it was anti-war.
Now it's food security.''
