Readers often send me questions that are of interest to more than an audience of one, and lately they have almost all involved fruits and vegetables.
One reader was anxious about the pesticides in strawberries, and whether cooking the fruit reduced any risk.
The rankings reflect the number of pesticides in various fruits and vegetables, and the percentage of each category that is cantaminated with pesticides.
Apples were at the top, followed by spinach, peaches, pears, strawberries, Chilean grapes, potatoes, red raspberries, celery and green beans.
As for whether cooking reduces the levels of pesticide in a fruit or vegetable, it depends on the type of fruit or vegetable and on how long it is cooked.
Turning apples into applesauce or tomatoes into tomato paste reduces levels significantly.
Freezing produce has virtually no impact.
Another reader wondered if peeling vegetables reduced the pesticide level.
Generally, peeling fruits and vegetables will reduce the level, but some pesticides are systemic and taken up through the roots.
Readers interested in more data on pesticides in food can log on to the Web site of the Environmental Working Group, which is at www.foodnews.org.
For those who are truly concerned about pesticides in conventional food, the safest alternative is organic food.
On another issue, a reader wondered about the nutritional value of vegetables in soup, explaining that her husband called soup ``dead vegetables'' because they are cooked so long.
Water-soluble vitamins B and C do leach out of vegetables when they are cooked in liquid, but in this case they go directly into the soup.
To keep the vegetables from looking dead, add the most tender ones just long enough to cook and contribute some flavor without turning to mush.
Still another reader wanted to know how pineapple juice and carrot juice can still have fiber in them after they have been processed.
The best source of that kind of information is Harold McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984).
As he explains, there are two kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble.
Pectin, which is used to gel jellies, is soluble fiber.
It doesn't appear to have any texture, but it does, so you might not be able to tell it was in the juice.
Cellulose and lignin are insoluble fibers.
The fiber in a glass of pineapple or carrot juice is soluble, and it cannot be seen because it is suspended in the liquid.
Insoluble fiber, if it is there, is the sediment, what eventually falls to the bottom of the glass.
Another reader had a more pressing question: Can you make a low-fat blue cheese dressing like the bottled kind at home?
Yes and no.
You can make a low-fat blue cheese dressing, but not like the one in the bottle.
In my version, which is given below, there is no guar gum, used as a thickener.
Because blue cheese has such a strong flavor, not much is needed, and that keeps the calories and fat down.
This dressing is delicious on ripe tomatoes or Belgian endive and as an alternative to the usual dressing for coleslaw or potato salad.
To make enough for four people, mash two ounces (four tablespoons) of blue cheese with six tablespoons of plain nonfat yogurt, two tablespoons of brandy and a couple of pinches of cayenne.
Mix well.
The dressing will keep for a week or two in the refrigerator, tightly covered.
