There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States because the genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the rest of the crop, costing American farmers about $200 million a year.
Some of the largest exporters, including Archer Daniels Midland, have said they will no longer accept altered corn for export and have let farmers know they want conventionally grown corn.
The impact of these actions on American farmers, who are already in deep financial trouble, can be devastating.
In trying to keep a dialogue going with America's European trading partners, Glickman sought to tone down the administration's rhetoric, which has included calling Europeans ``irrational'' because of their opposition to genetically modified foods.
Glickman said he had spoken to ``White House people'' before he made his remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, but one other administration official said the speech had taken them by surprise.
Genetic modification is the insertion of genes from one species of animal or plant or from microbes into another, permanently altering its genetic code.
It can confer resistance on plants to certain insects and diseases that would in some cases require the use of pesticides.
Soybeans have been genetically altered so that they can tolerate applications of an herbicide that kills the weeds in the same field.
Those who oppose genetic modification of food do so on two grounds: The safety of these foods has never been tested and they are harmful to the environment.
The Food and Drug Administration does not require testing, just assurances from the company that manufactures the genetically modified food that it is safe.
Glickman acknowledged that none of the agencies responsible for the safety of genetically modified foods USDA, FDA or Environmental Protection Agency had enough staff or resources to conduct such testing.
Environmental questions are more problematic.
The Environmental Defense Fund, a public interest lobbying group, filed a petition with the EPA Tuesday asking it to require farmers to plant conventional corn around the fields of the genetically modified corn to prevent the escape of toxic pollens into areas where butterflies feed.
There is also concern that the pesticide resistance engineered into plants could transfer to weeds and insects, producing superweeds and superbugs.
Even Americans who do not necessarily oppose genetic engineering believe that such products should be labeled.
In a survey conducted by the European company Novartis, more than 90 percent called for labeling.
In addition, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to the FDA demanding mandatory labeling of such foods.
The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, has filed a lawsuit against the FDA to reclassify genetic modification as an additive that would require labeling.
When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
Glickman, known as a strong supporter of biotechnology, said in his speech Tuesday that it was important to ``encourage the development of these new food production systems.''
But, he added, ``We cannot blindly embrace their benefits.
We have to ensure public confidence in general, consumer confidence in particular.''
In a speech earlier this year at Purdue University, he said, ``We also can't force these new genetically engineered food products down consumers' throats.''
And he compared biotechnology today to nuclear power 20 years ago.
``We have a way in this country of latching on to solutions, pursuing them to the exclusion of others, and then watching them sometimes backfire,'' he said.
``We did that in the late '70s when we embraced nuclear power as the primary source of our energy needs.
Then, Three Mile Island happened.
Now nuclear power is still part of our energy grid, but it's not the only part.
``Let's not put all of our eggs in the biotech basket.''
It is a comparison that the biotech industry considers invidious but opponents believe is valid.
