Farmers upset by the overly broad label of ``organic'' foods may find relief later this year with an expected government ruling that will limit the kinds of foods receiving that definition.
``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to protect the integrity of your industry,'' Keith Jones of the Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program told farmers at the Ecological Farming Conference on Thursday.''
The government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics.
The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too permissive.
``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is a member of the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers.
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's attention.''
The department is developing the first national standards on organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.
In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion.
Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming Research Foundation said.
Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government.
For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides, herbicides or preservatives.
Livestock should be raised in open-air environments, without antibiotics or hormones.
Last year, the USDA proposed allowing food to be labeled ``organic'' even if it was irradiated to kill germs, genetically engineered, or subjected to sewage sludge.
The rules also would have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry groups.
Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw the proposal and try again.
Some farmers at the conference remained skeptical that his verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again.
``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but we still believe in it.
That's kind of where we are in this process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C. ``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,'' said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a Santa Fe, N.M. company.
``For many of us, this is a continuation of a lifetime of work.
First it was civil rights.
Then it was anti-war.
Now it's food security.''
The new rules will probably be published this summer in the Federal Register and could take effect in the fall, said Jones.
