New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide.
That doesn't mean, however, that organic is better than conventional food, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
''Just because something is labeled organic does not mean that it is any more superior, any safer or more healthy than conventional food.
All food in this country must meet the same high standards of safety, regardless of their classification,'' Glickman said in releasing the proposed rules Tuesday.
The rules, almost a decade in the making, would bar the use of genetically engineered crops, disease-killing irradiation treatments or industrial sludge as a fertilizer.
Products grown and processed according to the standards and contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic.''
Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made with'' organic ingredients.
The new standards, intended to replace a hodgepodge of state and private rules, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in livestock production and require the use of organic feed.
The rules also restrict the kind of fertilizers, pesticides and food additives that can be used.
With a few exceptions, synthetic chemicals would not be allowed.
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.
The proposed rules ''will preserve the well-defined production practices that characterize organic agriculture,'' said Hiu Newcomb, who runs organic vegetable farms in the Washington area.
But the National Food Processors Association said USDA ignored scientific evidence in deciding to block the use of genetically engineered crops or irradiation.
Conventional meat and produce can be irradiated to kill harmful bacteria.
''While the public's views are important, rules governing food labeling and food safety must be based on sound science, and sound science cannot be determined by public opinion polling,'' said Kelly Johnston, a spokeswoman for the group, which represents major food processors and manufacturers.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, who wrote a 1990 law that required USDA to develop the rules, said they should provide a boost to the organic industry, which has already been growing by 20 percent a year.
Without such standards, ''there are limits to consumer acceptance and export potential,'' the Vermont Democrat said.
Enforcement of the rules will be left to states and private certifying agencies.
Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic, only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency.
Farmers and processors will then be given 18 months to get into compliance.
