Forget about getting a hot cup of Guatamala Antigua in Goldthwaite.
Don't look for that to change anytime soon.
That's because while Starbucks Coffee, maker of the big-named bean juices like those, is adding 500 stores this year, most are planned for big cities.
On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
The company has 2,000 stores worldwide, including 106 stores in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston.
Not even El Paso has made the cut.
In downtown Austin, where you can hardly hurl a stone without hitting a Starbucks or some other java joint in some circles the capital city has rapidly become the cappuccino city Starbucks is opening at least one new store this year in mid-March at 24th and Nueces streets just west of the University of Texas campus.
The Seattle-based company has opened nine Austin locations since coming to town four years ago.
When determining where to place a new Starbucks, the company looks at a number of demographic factors, including average age, average income and whether a city's residents have been ordering coffee from the company's catalog.
While Starbucks may never make it to the Panhandle or the small towns of East Texas, its presence still may be felt there.
The company tapped Pepsi-Cola Co. to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee beverage, which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said Schultz.
Starbucks also joined Kraft Foods, Inc. in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in America,'' said Schultz.
``We are going to have much, much more than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise you.''
