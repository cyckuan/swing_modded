Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million.
Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several years and considers music an important part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht Quist.
``This is a minor acquisition (for Starbucks), but it is a first step toward fortifying the whole in-store and online experience,'' said Tonneson.
The deal closed in mid-October and Hear's staff has already moved to Starbucks' offices in Seattle, said Don MacKinnon, Hear's former chief executive, in a telephone interview yesterday.
MacKinnon's new title is vice president, music and entertainment, for Starbucks.
Hear Music stores are unusual in that they focus on educating shoppers about music and introducing them to new artists.
Listening stations are arranged thematically; shoppers are allowed to unwrap and listen to any CD in the store.
MacKinnon told The Chronicle in September that he intended to roll out 75 to 100 Hear Music stores across the country.
But yesterday, he said plans for new non-Starbucks locations are on hold, although the five existing locations in Berkeley, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago will remain open.
Partnering with Starbucks was Hear's best option for going national, MacKinnon said.
It's the best place to find Hear's upscale customer ``in the right mood, in great numbers and at a time when they sort of taking a pause in their day.''
Starbucks did not release terms of the deal other than to say that it spent less than $10 million.
In a conference call with analysts Thursday, Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz disclosed plans to install listening stations in some Starbucks cafes, according to Andrew Barish, an analyst with Robertson Stephens.
The kiosks will likely connect to a Hear Music Intranet that contains music reviews and recommendations.
The Intranet is currently used in a new Hear prototype store in San Francisco's Metreon shopping center.
MacKinnon said no decision has been made about how many stores will include kiosks.
``There will be different solutions in different stores,'' he said.
Yesterday, 800 of Starbucks' 2,500 stores installed fixtures holding branded Starbucks CDs, plus other selections chosen by the Hear team, such as the popular Buena Vista Social Club.
In the future, MacKinnon and his staff will produce all of Starbucks' CDs.
Music accounts for less than 1 percent of total Starbucks sales, Tonneson said.
Starbucks has installed a link from its home page, www.starbucks.com, to Hear Music's site, www.hearmusic.com.
Starbucks is also promoting links with two other new Web partners, Cooking.com and Geerlings Wade, a mail-order wine retailer.
This summer, Starbucks announced an ambitious strategy of creating a ``lifestyle portal'' of upscale brands on the Web.
It formed partnerships with several Web content providers and attempted to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., which spurned the offer.
But investors frowned on that strategy, sending Starbucks' stock plummeting.
Since then, Starbucks has scaled back those plans.
``Instead of an all-consuming focus for Howard Schultz it's more of a sidebar,'' Tonneson said.
Hear Music, which was privately held, generated revenues of between $5 million and $10 million in 1998.
It was founded by MacKinnon and two partners in Cambridge, Mass., in 1990.
Hear was sold in 1992 to CML Group, which undertook an unsuccessful rollout.
MacKinnon and a partner bought it back from CML for $371,000 in 1996.
In addition to its five U.S. stores and the Starbucks deal, Hear licenses its name and format to Chapters, a Canadian superstore chain, which runs 12 in-store music shops under the Hear name.
