Starbucks Corp. warned Wednesday that annual profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal.
Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
The announcement was made after the markets closed.
Starbucks' shares fell $10, or nearly 27 percent, in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing the regular session at $37.56 1/4.
Kevin Calabrese, editor and analyst at Argus Research predicted the stock would rebound gradually Thursday.
``I'm certain it won't hold there in the morning,'' Calabrese said.
But he cautioned, ``I don't think it's going to climb up to where it closed today for a while.''
Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks' other businesses haven't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a conference call.
He named the company's specialty food business and its North American partnership with Pepsi.
Schultz also cited $4 million in unbudgeted costs for developing the company's Internet strategy.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.
While the company's North American retail profit margin is up 1 percent in fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998, Schultz said profits fell below internal estimates.
In retail sales alone, Schultz said, revenue was expected to be $16 million less than initial internal projections.
Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever for the potential for significant profit growth.''
The Internet will play a role in that growth.
To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and home furnishings as well as coffee products and music.
He also said the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the Internet site later this summer.
By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion.
According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $70,000.
``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
