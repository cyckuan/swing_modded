The on-line delivery service Kozmo.com is teaming up with Starbucks Coffee Co. for cross marketing and in-store promotions.
Starting this spring, Kozmo customers will be able to leave videos and other delivery items in drop-boxes located in Starbucks where the service operates.
Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee retailer, will also help hype Kozmo as it enters new markets.
The New York-based Kozmo delivers movies, books, magazines, CDs, video games, and food.
Starting this spring, the service also will deliver Starbucks by the pound.
For Kozmo, it gives the burgeoning company much-needed exposure.
So what does the seemingly ubiquitous coffee roaster get out of it?
How about $150 million over five years.
``This all speaks to what most Internet companies are facing, and that's the high cost of customer acquisition,'' said Howard Schultz, Starbucks' chairman and chief executive.
The Internet-to-door delivery service, which was started in 1997, operates in five markets but plans to expand to 20 by the end of this year.
The company opened in New York in January 1999, followed by Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
The company plans to launch in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.
Schultz said he has been approached by other companies wanting to establish a partnership with Starbucks.
According to Starbucks, 90 percent of its 10 million weekly customer base use the Internet.
``This is the first time we've ever invited another brand or company to live inside our stores,'' he said.
``It's very clear Kozmo has resonated with their customers.''
Internet watchers, however, have questioned the economics of spending the high cost of delivering primarily small ticket items.
Joseph Park, Kozmo's chief executive, said his business model hinges on ``order density,'' or getting a large number of customers to use the service regularly.
``We're a lifestyle brand and we're looking for other products or service our customers would want to use or purchase on a frequent basis,'' he said.
``Coffee is probably one of the most frequent purchases a customer makes.''
