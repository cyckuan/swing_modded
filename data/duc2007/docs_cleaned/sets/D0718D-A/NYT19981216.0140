The Starbucks Coffee Co. plan to acquire Pasqua Coffee is leaving a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of some patrons of the San Francisco-based coffeehouse.
Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced Tuesday that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount.
Pasqua has 56 outlets in the Los Angles, New York and San Francisco areas.
Van Sias, a supervisor with the Department of Public Health, said he has been a Pasqua customer for five to six years.
``It's terrible, terrible,'' he said.
Starbucks coffeehouses ``are already all over the place.
``We're gonna have no more choices soon,'' said Berkeley resident Claire Greensfelder, 46, who said she avoids Starbucks at all costs in favor of mom-and-pop cafes.
``It's destruction of individual choice, and it takes the fun out of it if every coffee shop is the same.''
With the purchase of Pasqua, Starbucks will inherit a small chain that had $26 million in revenue last year, adding to an empire that had sales of $1.3 billion by comparison.
The transition should be complete by February.
Starbucks, with more than 1,700 stores in North America, wants to add 400 more in the United States and Canada within the year.
In April, the chain paid about $81 million in stock for the Seattle Coffee Co. in Britain.
``With the addition of the Pasqua locations, we're even more confident that we'll meet our goal in continental North America,'' said Alan Gulick, a Starbucks spokesman.
Stephanie Sheffield, who works at Pasqua shop in San Francisco, said she learned about the sale from her sister, who works for Starbucks.
In July, the San Francisco-based Spinelli Coffee Co. was purchased by Tully's Coffee Corp., another Seattle company.
Pasqua, which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks banner, operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and New York, and has eight licensed airport locations in California.
In addition, the company has a coffee roastery in San Francisco, three commissaries and two bakeries.
Pasqua co-founder Martin Kupferman acknowledged it had gotten more difficult to compete with Starbucks.
``It's Starbucks, and nobody else is going to touch them,'' said Kupferman, who added that he was satisfied with terms of the sale.
