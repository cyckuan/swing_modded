Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks.
Seattle-based Starbucks hopes that with Tazo it can attract new customers.
The company will discontinue its in-house Infusia brand of tea, which currently accounts for just 1 percent of Starbucks' $1.3 billion in annual sales.
``Tea will drive more people into our stores, and I think this is the highest-quality tea in the nation,'' said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer.
``It's a much-loved brand.''
Tazo should be available in Starbucks stores by the end of the year.
Tazo calls itself ``The Reincarnation of Tea'' on its labels and cultivates a quirky image.
The ingredients listing, for example, says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified tea shaman.''
Tazo is sold in tea bags, in leaves and bottled as iced tea.
Its blends include minty Refresh, chamomile-based Calm, citrus Wild Sweet Orange, and Passion, billed as a blend of hibiscus and other tropical flowers and herbs.
Steve Smith, who founded Tazo in 1994, would not disclose what Starbucks paid for Tazo.
