Time Inc. has joined forces with Starbucks, the coffeehouse giant responsible for caffeinating seven million Americans every week.
The two companies will start publication this summer of Joe, a cultural review that will be sold in the 2,000 Starbucks stores sprinkled across the United States and Canada as liberally as the chocolate powder on top of a double-mocha cappuccino grande.
Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one encounters in a coffeehouse.
To that end, the magazine's subtitle will be ``Life is Interesting.
Discuss.''
If that sounds similar to the subtitle for Tina Brown's Talk hers is ``The American Conversation'' it is purely coincidental, Mowbray said.
``We aren't inviting comparisons to anyone,'' he said.
``It's going to be a cultural magazine, but not in the gray sense, not in the review sense.''
About 400,000 copies of the first 84-page issue, which will cost $3, will arrive in Starbucks stores in June.
Three bimonthly issues are planned for this year.
Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said: ``Starbucks has emerged as the third place, between home and work, in America.
It is the true extension of people's front porch.
What people do inside Starbucks is talk, and coffee has been the centerpiece of conversation for hundreds of years.''
David L. Long, president of media sales and marketing at Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc., is not as interested in conversation as he is in circulation.
``If we can sell a copy and a half a day in each of their stores, we'll make a bunch of money,'' Long said, adding that producing a magazine for a chain that already provides distribution eliminates all the costs of building circulation.
``Our distribution costs are zero,'' he said.
Because Starbucks already has alliances with United Airlines, Barnes Noble and the Starwood hotel chain, Joe has natural advertisers.
General Motors, which is not affiliated, has signed up for several pages of advertising in the first issue.
Schultz would not say what writers already had delivered pieces for Joe, but he said he had spoken to Garry Trudeau and Nora Ephron about contributing.
``Did you see `You've Got Mail'?''
``She used Starbucks almost like a character in the movie.
It was incredible.''
