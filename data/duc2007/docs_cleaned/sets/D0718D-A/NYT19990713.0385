small group of Pasqua Inc. shareholders is accusing Bankers Trust, Pasqua's former controlling shareholder, of stiffing minority investors when the San Francisco coffee chain was sold to Starbucks earlier this year.
Bankers Trust lawyer denied the allegations.
Starbucks paid $7.1 million for the 56-cafe chain in a deal that became final March 1, according to the complaint.
In the suit, led by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that the company's market value was much higher.
The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's stock.
They are accusing Bankers Trust, which owned 45 percent and, they say, effectively controlled the board, of breaching its fiduciary duty by not considering bids from Starbucks' rivals.
The Pasqua shareholders also contend that Bankers Trust failed to disclose a conflict of interest: that an affiliate, BT Alex.
Brown, Starbucks' longtime investment bank, was advising Starbucks on the Pasqua merger and receiving fees for the work.
The accusations are ``silly,'' said Peter Ostroff, a partner with Sidley Austin who represents Bankers Trust.
Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor group earlier this year to stop the merger.
But the court allowed the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they received fair-market value for their shares.
``They don't have the right to any relief other than an appraisal,'' Ostroff said.
``If it turns out that the appraiser agrees the price isn't fair, they'll get an adjustment.''
The complaint, which originally was filed in June, was amended in a filing Monday.
Joseph Tabacco, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said in a telephone interview yesterday that Pasqua's board did not seriously consider offers from other interested parties.
Specifically, Peet's Coffee Tea of Emeryville offered $15 million for Pasqua in February, a month before the Starbucks deal closed.
Pasqua's board should have ``engaged in an auction to obtain the best price, that's certainly an opportunity they had,'' said Tabacco, a partner with Berman, DeValerio, Pease Tabacco.
But Ostroff said the Peet's offer was ``too little, too late and much too contingent'' on unknowns to scuttle the Starbucks deal.
Although Pasqua had 1998 sales of $26.5 million and its Bay Area stores were mostly healthy, its operations in New York and Los Angeles were ``hemorrhaging money,'' this source said.
Zuckerman, who served as Pasqua's chairman and chief executive for many years, said he was the lone Pasqua board member to oppose the Starbucks deal.
Because shareholders never gathered for the vote (which was conducted by mail), it was difficult to fight the Starbucks acquisition before the deal closed, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Zuckerman could not explain why investors holding the remaining 35 percent of Pasqua shares, including co-founder Martin Kupferman, did not join in the suit.
Kupferman could not be reached for comment.
Tabacco said 90 percent of such cases end in settlements.
Peet's did not return a telephone call.
