Basketball legend Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and Starbucks boss Howard Schultz brought their inner-city road show to Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood Friday.
They opened the latest in their 50-50 joint-venture Starbucks Coffee stores and Johnson said there will be more in Seattle, along with one of Johnson's multiplex movie theaters.
Schultz's Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. and Johnson's Los Angeles-based Johnson Development Corp. have recently opened similar Starbucks coffee stores in West Los Angeles and New York's Harlem.
More than 200 residents of the South Seattle Columbia City community turned out to catch a glimpse of the retired National Basketball Association superstar who became a top-flight business executive.
His mom, Sheree Davis, brought Michael and his stepbrother, Forrest Britt, 5, to the store at the corner of Rainier Avenue South and South Edmunds Street to see Johnson and, perhaps pick up his autograph.
Johnson and Schultz said that along with making a profit, a major goal of their venture is helping the community by showing other companies that it is good business to bring services to inner cities.
``We hope other national retailers will come in.''
Johnson said giving pride to the community, bringing ``a first class'' retailer and supplying jobs are among his goals.
``We feel the community here deserves this,'' Johnson said.
``We want what everybody else wants and that's the best of the best and today you have the best.''
Johnson said that the millions of dollars he earned during his 13-year professional basketball career financed his businesses and insisted he runs his five-company empire.
``I'm a hands-on boss,'' he said.
His businesses include movie theaters, a retail mall, television and children's multimedia production companies, a concert and boxing promotion company, a record label and controlling interest in a Los Angeles bank.
Brenda Johnson, a Columbia City resident, agreed that bringing the Starbucks store to the neighborhood could bring jobs and other benefits.
Not everyone welcomed the new Starbucks store, however.
Outside, a man passed out leaflets charging Starbucks ``exploits prison labor.''
Starbucks spokeswoman said she knew nothing about the charges and couldn't respond.
Schultz earlier said that Starbucks stores ``enlarge the coffee-drinking community and there is usually enough business for all.''
``It's too early to tell what the effect will be here,'' Eaton said.
