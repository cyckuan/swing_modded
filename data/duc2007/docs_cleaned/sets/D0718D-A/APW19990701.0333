Starbucks Corp. shares tumbled today after the coffee retailer warned that shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the year.
Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.
Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever for the potential for significant profit growth.''
The Internet will play a role in that growth.
To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and home furnishings as well as coffee products and music.
He also said the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the Internet site later this summer.
By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion.
According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $70,000.
``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
