It seems absurd: The world's biggest coffee shop, Starbucks Corp., trying to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., a seller of leather armchairs and mixing bowls.
Starbucks' acquisition offer, rebuffed by San Francisco's Williams-Sonoma earlier this month, was unexpected because it ignored the conventional rules of retail mergers.
Typically such deals tout synergistic benefits in areas like real estate, buying raw goods or marketing none of which have much traction in this case.
Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer, proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an Internet play an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.
Four years ago, such a combination would have made no sense.
Even today it seems a bit wacky.
But it also provides a striking example of how the digital world is redefining businesses as analog as a double decaf macchiato.
``Business as usual is dead and the rule book has been thrown out,'' said Jamie Owens, president of the Retail Group, a Seattle consulting firm.
Companies today ``are not fish nor fowl, they've got fins and feathers.''
Starbucks declined to comment on the acquisition attempt, first reported in The Chronicle on Friday, and Williams-Sonoma will say only that it is not for sale.
Sources say that Williams-Sonoma's board voted to reject Starbucks' overture in an emergency meeting in mid-June.
Industry observers see the move as vintage Howard Schultz.
Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, is proving as ambitious on the Web as he has been with physical stores.
This is a man who, a decade ago, looked at a country where coffee is available on every street corner and proceeded to roll out a national chain of coffee bars.
Now he heads a $1.3 billion company that sells coffee, tea, canned drinks, and ice cream in supermarkets and more than 2,000 coffee bars around the world.
Schultz sees the Web as a key meeting place in the lifestyle of the future, and he plans to be there.
At the center of his strategy is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale women.
Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of New York, which is designing such a portal.
Details are sketchy, but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and the Internet.''
Already 70 percent of Starbucks high-income customers are on the Internet, Schultz noted, so he's got the right kind of upscale, wired demographics for the project.
Other pieces of Starbucks' Internet strategy include investing millions of dollars in chat-room developer Talk City in April and the launch earlier this month of an online and in-store magazine, Joe, in cooperation with Time Inc. A press release described Joe as a new vehicle for ``conversation, community and culture'' allied with the Starbucks brand.
But there's a problem: coffee drinks aren't available on the Web.
``Computers can't serve latte, at least not yet,'' noted retail analyst Bonnie Kramer Tonneson of Hambrecht Quist.
Even coffee beans, which constitute a small minority of Starbucks' sales, don't have much Net potential since Starbucks operates physical shops on almost every corner, making access to beans at least as convenient as at www.starbucks.
So who does Starbucks turn to for a highly branded, well-known merchant partner that can attract wealthy shoppers and generate significant Web sales?
Although Williams-Sonoma is late to the Web it just launched its first full-scale site June 1 its high-cachet brand name, big-ticket merchandise and loyal customer base make it a logical partner.
But Williams-Sonoma has its own Internet strategy in mind.
Three days after rebuffing the coffee-maker, Williams-Sonoma announced a deal with CondeNet, the online magazine affiliate of Conde Nast magazines.
Williams-Sonoma expects to be a player in a portal/cable TV business under development by CondeNet and Time Warner.
The retailer is rolling out a full-scale Williams-Sonoma kitchenware store this fall, adding to its new wedding registry at www.
Next year it plans to launch two Pottery Barn home furnishings sites, a registry and a store.
Cynthia Cohen, president of the consulting firm Strategic Mindshare, likens Starbucks' lust for Williams-Sonoma to the purchase of cataloger Fingerhut Companies Inc. by Federated Department Stores Inc. earlier this year.
Fingerhut's appeal was its expertise in back-end order fulfillment, which Federated intends to apply to its e-commerce businesses, said Cohen.
Williams-Sonoma also boasts crack fulfillment systems, and carries the additional value of well-known and highly regarded brand names Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold Everything and Chambers.
Conventional retailers like Williams-Sonoma ``already have equity in consumers' minds, trusted brands have everything to do with the future of e-commerce,'' said Owens.
The Starbucks overture raises questions about Williams-Sonoma's future as an independent company.
One reason it was considered a desirable takeover candidate is that its stock is priced more like that of a modest store and catalog merchant than a hot e-commerce play.
But that is starting to change.
Shares have risen 20 percent since news of the Starbucks bid became public, closing yesterday at $35.81, up $1.81.
Whether Williams-Sonoma is now being valued for its e-commerce potential or as an acquisition target is hard to say.
Tonneson believes the stock still has plenty of upside potential since investors are just beginning to think of it as an e-commerce play.
Consequently, Williams-Sonoma executive stockholders are unlikely to sell now and miss out on any future stock run-up, she said.
``Why give that away to someone else, when now they're really in the game?''
Tonneson said.
