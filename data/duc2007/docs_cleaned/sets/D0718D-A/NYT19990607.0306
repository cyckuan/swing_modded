Who better to write about heroes than heroes?
That was the thinking behind Time's ($3.95) ``Person of the Century'' project.
In the final installment of 20 nominees, Henry Aaron writes about Jackie Robinson, and avid soccer fan Henry Kissinger offers his views on Pele.
``They say certain people are bigger than life,'' Aaron writes, ``but Jackie Robinson is the only man I've known who truly was.''
How was the list of nominees compiled?
``Jackie Robinson broke the color line in baseball; Helen Keller demolished old notions about the blind and deaf; Harvey Milk dared to put himself on the ballot as an openly gay candidate.''
And, of course, there are the old standby heroes such as Charles Lindbergh, Muhammad Ali, Mother Teresa, Anne Frank and America's GIs.
When director Stanley Kubrick asked Frederic Raphael to work with him on a script in 1994, the screenwriter for ``Darling'' and ``Two for the Road'' jumped at the chance.
Basically, Kubrick wanted to adapt an Austrian novel about a devoted couple whose lives spin off into an erotic nightmare at a masquerade ball in which they are separately propositioned.
Raphael, who describes his experiences with the temperamental director in The New Yorker ($3), soon found himself in his own nightmare.
Kubrick wanted the script for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to be unmistakably his, and he wanted to move the action from turn-of-the-century Vienna to contemporary New York.
Hadn't many things changed since then, Raphael asked, including relations between men and women?
``Think so?''
Kubrick said.
The publicity machine for ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is cranked and running at full speed, with Mike Meyers gracing the covers of Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) and GQ ($3) this week.
Not surprisingly, the Entertainment Weekly article is little more than an unabashed plug for the film.
The more balanced GQ profile delves into Meyers' background as the son of an Encyclopaedia Brittanica salesman who died tragically after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
The elder Meyers was a major influence on his son's sense of humor, writes John Brodie.
``He loved ... Peter Sellers, Beyond the Fringe, Monty Python and the early `Saturday Night Live.'''
Joe ($3), a magazine sold exclusively in Starbucks stores, debuts June 16 with an impressive lineup of articles, including a quirky essay by author Joy Williams about the Unabomber's cabin.
Produced under a joint agreement with Starbucks and Time Inc., the magazine is slick and obviously aimed at a young upscale audience.
Much of the premiere issue takes an edgy look at trust in human relationships.
``It is not a magazine about coffee,'' says Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz, ``but it is certainly inspired by the idea of coffeehouse culture.''
Robyn Burnham leads a swinging life, literally, as a paleobotanist whose specialty is studying vines of the South American rain forest.
In an intriguing profile in the second issue of Women Outside ($3.95), Kent Black follows the 42-year-old Burnham deep into Ecuador's heart of darkness in search of medicinal plants.
Stress is a common complaint, but it's more than an annoying byproduct of a frantic lifestyle.
It can be a killer, experts say in a Newsweek ($3.50) cover story.
Scientists acknowledge that living a stress-free life is not a realistic goal, but there are ways to deal with tension.
Suggested treatments include meditation, massage, exercise and structured group support.
The readers of Jane ($2.95) voted the Rolling Stones' ``No Security Tour'' as worst of 1999 in the magazine's second annual entertainment poll.
Second was Lilith Fair, followed by the Spice Girls.
Jezebel ($3.95) profiles superstar Shania Twain and drag supermodel RuPaul in the June issue.
