Starbucks will soon be offering a new kind of Joe.
The giant coffee shop owner announced Monday it is teaming with Time Inc. to publish a magazine called Joe that will be sold at most of Starbucks' 1,800 locations across North America.
The first issue of Joe will be published in June, covering a variety of topics including books, film, art and travel.
Two more issues are scheduled for this year.
``The coffeehouse has always been at the center of conversation, community and culture.
With Joe, we want to encourage those traditions,'' Howard Schultz, chairman of Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co., said in a statement.
Scott Mowbray, managing editor of Time Inc.'s custom publishing division, will be Joe's managing editor.
Time Inc. is the nation's largest magazine publisher, with such titles as Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Entertainment Weekly.
