Starbucks Coffee Co. announced a new a consumer products division for its specialty ice cream, bottled coffee drinks and other products sold away from its own shops.
It also said it will share revenue with CARE from its first month's sale of a new package of coffees from Latin America.
The company's new division will be headed by Paul Davis, 42.
Davis has spent 14 years at PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, most recently as head of Hostess Frito-Lay Canada.
He becomes president of consumer products for Starbucks, and will report to Starbucks' president and chief operating officer, Orin Smith.
Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said the move ``represents our commitment to building a major consumer products business'' around ``an enduring global brand.''
The new division will take over business that already brought in $206 million last year, or almost 16 percent of the company's total sales.
Most of it has been joint ventures: the ice cream with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola; and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft Foods Inc.
The company has just introduced a line of premium chocolates in its stores, but made no announcement about any other channel of distibution.
Schultz noted the company's success in extending the Starbucks brand and said, ``We are in the early stages of this business.''
The company also continues in its commitment as a major donor to CARE, for which it has helped to raise $1.4 million since 1991.
Tomorrow, it will begin offering a new package of of coffees from Guatemala, Costa Rica and Brazil, and will donate $1 per package sold through May 11.
The money will be used to support community organization in the highlands of Guatemala, as part of a ``civil society'' project there; girls' education in Nyeri, Kenya, where it has not been customary to send girls to school; and education in hygiene and farming practices in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
All are countries that grow coffee for Starbucks.
The new pack is also notable in that it is the first time Starbucks has offered single-origin coffee from Brazil.
Mary Williams, senior vice president for coffee, said she had not been impressed with the overall quality of coffee from Brazil, but that it has been improving.
She said this sample, a heavy-bodied, low-acid variety called Ipanema Bourbon, represents the country's best.
Starbucks also said Monday its revenue was up 27 percent in the five weeks ended March 28 compared with a year earlier, or 6 percent on a same-store basis.
On March 28, the company had 2,192 stores.
It had opened 309 in the previous half-year.
