Office of the United States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that are published in the United States.
The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930, when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
To date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
The King family retains control of the official papers of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee.
These papers are currently housed at the King Center, and will remain there.
Indeed, in 1997, both Stanford University and Emory entered into negotiations with the King family to buy some of the papers housed at the King Center.
But the two universities were not really interested in the material that now may be sold to the Library of Congress, according to Phillip Jones, chairman of Intellectual Properties Management, an Atlanta company that oversees the King estate.
It is unclear whether the payments the King family will receive from the library will be used to maintain official documents like the SCLC papers that are still housed at the King Center.
Some historians say they fear that should the originals of King's personal papers be removed from the King Center, the King family will lose interest in protecting the rest of the collection.
The Library of Congress has long been a repository of the papers or leaders and organizations of the African American civil rights movement.
Among the official papers housed there are those of The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the private papers of A. Phillip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall, Booker T. Washington and Bayard Rustin.
But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to many Americans of all races.
In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March on Washington.
The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial harmony and justice.
Last year, a federal judge in Washington denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public domain.
``The family is amazing, isn't it?''
``They're first ones, in my knowledge, from the civil rights era who have made money on it.
They're really creating an image that was counter to his.''
But others defend the King family's right to earn money.
