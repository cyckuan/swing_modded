The biggest debate on Capitol Hill the one that tells us most about our national character, the one that offers the insight into the national mind is not about the future of Medicare, or how to use the budget surplus, or whether taxes should be cut, or whether defense spending ought to rise.
The biggest debate on Capitol Hill is over whether books ought to be shelved by size.
The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the national library or, more precisely, in Congress's library and it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
Shelving books by size, rather than content, is the idea of some administrators of the library, which is awash in books.
Too many books.
If all the large books were together on big shelves, all the small books would be together on small shelves, there would be no gaping holes lost space in between.
Such a plan could, say its supporters, increase shelf availability by as much as 33 percent.
Ah, but at what cost?
At stake is the place of the written word in the American imagination; the nation's devotion to the fine and practiced art of browsing, even in the amazon.com age; the scholar's impulse to break learning into subject areas; the researcher's conviction that a truth, if not necessarily the truth, can be stumbled upon if only a liberated mind is let loose amongst the stacks of a great library.
The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items, including more than 17,772,400 books.
The very idea of shelving books by size the notion of putting the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones somewhere else is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and scholars.
It is a dagger at the heart of the bibliophile's pastime, browsing.
And it is a threat to the greatest delight of the researcher, serendipity.
But it is more than that.
It screams order in a world where learning only serves to underline the persistence of disorder.
It imposes neatness on the messy turmoil of the mind.
It celebrates efficiency in a realm of human endeavor where the great harvests often come amid chaotic inefficiency.
So far scores of Library of Congress librarians, the Library of Congress Professional Association, and Local 2910 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have howled in protest.
In truth, even the people floating the idea aren't wild about it.
But it hasn't gone away.
Neither have the library's space problems.
Indeed, they've only become greater.
Take a few steps into Deck 9 of the John Adams Building, one of the three massive structures the library maintains on Capitol Hill, and you'll see why.
Pause at the QA 76 section, where books on computers are collected.
So many books sit on the floor that a pair of size 11 loafers cannot navigate the tiny space remaining between the stacks.
Sitting on the floor, the back cover at a 45-degree angle and the spine under enormous strain, is a copy of the fourth edition of Stephen Wolfram's ``The Mathematica.''
This is a book in the throes of destruction in the world's greatest book collection, dedicated above all to preservation.
Down on Deck 7 of the stacks the situation is little better.
There, amid the neatly stacked collections of the library's justly celebrated Asia collection, is the space problem displayed in stark and unforgiving light.
On the shelves are thousands of books, assembled crisply by subject.
But around the shelves themselves, in a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier field of knowledge.
This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal appropriation (some $400 million) is too small.
It is simply a measure of the explosion of information, publications, monographs, newspapers, pamphlets, maps, moving images, photographs, posters, prints, and drawings.
But mostly the problem is books.
The book collection of the world's biggest library half the collection is in languages other than English, 460 in all is growing by about 300,000 volumes a year.
``We're running out of space,'' complains Steven Herman, the chief of the collection-management division of the library.
``We have to see if we can make the most efficient use of the shelves we have now.''
There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library attracts about 2 million people a year making it one of the biggest attractions for tourists in the capital the notion of moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current locations is unthinkable.
In desperation quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might put it the library already is taking some significant steps to expand its shelf space.
In 14 months the library will open a huge off-site storage space in Fort Meade, Md., which should relieve some of the pressure but at a price.
The Fort Meade space will not be open to browsing, and any book that a researcher requests won't be available on Capitol Hill for half a day, maybe longer.
The library is planning two delivery runs a day from its new state-of-the-art building (modern security, sophisticated temperature and humidity controls) but researchers in Washington for only a day are almost certainly going to be disappointed.
One is double-shelving, or placing a smaller row of books in front of a larger row.
The library already employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by size.
Each book would have a fixed place on a fixed shelf.
No need to keep some empty space at the end of the shelf in the anticipation that new works might be on the way.
No need to worry just where that new volume should rest, between which other volumes.
They'd go in, all in a row, catalogued precisely by computer, so that the researcher looking for a copy of James Morris's ``Pax Britannica'' or Carl Yastrzemski and Al Hirshberg's ``Yaz'' would know exactly where to look.
Moreover, William L. Shirer's ``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' Dr. Suess's ``The Cat in the Hat,'' and John P. Marquand's ``The Late George Apley'' might be sitting there right beside each other, being roughly the same size.
Herman knows the plan has some disadvantages.
``We get questions no one else can answer,'' he says.
``One of the ways to answer them to to go to a section of the stacks and fan through tables of contents or indexes and look.
It's a lot easier to look up something on lighthouses, for example, if you can just go to one place and browse.
It's easier to go to a shelf and see exactly what's in the books.
``There are some very good arguments for continuing that,'' he says.
``But it takes up significant amounts of space.''
But the argument about shelving books by size is worth having, not only because the great surge in printed material is causing a problem that many libraries from Harvard and Cornell to the national libraries of France and Britain can no longer avoid.
It is worth having, too, because it raises important questions about the human mind and the human spirit.
And so now on Capitol Hill, so often the site for discussions trite and trivial, the topic finally has turned to a clash of real values, to a subject that has enduring significance, to a topic that, more than most others, defines who we are, and how we conserve the things that we value the most.
This debate is occasioned, like most of the important debates of the last quarter-century, by a deficit of some sort.
But this one, unlike the budget deficit (which has been slain) and the trade deficit (which persists amid our prosperity), doesn't exist primarily in accounting ledgers.
It exists in real, physical space.
