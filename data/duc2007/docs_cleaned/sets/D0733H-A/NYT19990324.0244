In truth, I have consciously shied away from them, seeing digital tools as a frivolous assault on scholarly standards.
After spending a week playing with The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the American experience through documents selected from the world's largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his faith.
Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts.
All provide a glimpse of the treasures to be found in the Library of Congress' fabulous special collections.
(The DVD-ROM version has 19 additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three hours of full-screen video.)
Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps, prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National Cemetery (1943).
Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along chronological and thematic lines.
Following a concise and beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War.
Each category contains a time line covering the course of American history.
All the images are accompanied by crisp commentary.
Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits created specifically for Eyes of the Nation.
These include things like the step-by-step construction of the U.S. Capitol and the satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the creative use of primary sources.
Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands of historical documents.
Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly succeeds.
All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in portfolios created by users, and printed.
All contain a written commentary.
The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on the contents a good idea when reading an old letter or studying battlefield maps.
Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete.
While including all the images, it does not search the larger text.
So my attempts to locate J. Edgar Hoover, Barry Goldwater and Donald Duck turned up nothing.
Are they somewhere on this CD-ROM?
There also appears to be no cross-referencing.
Using the word ``tennis,'' I could find no match for Billie Jean King.
She is categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted athlete Bella Abzug.
Worse, my search for Dwight D. Eisenhower turned up a single image, although I'm certain from my own browsing that there were at least two.
There are other problems.
After 1970, the project clearly loses momentum.
The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller.''
There is little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political road.
You could easily come away from the images and commentary on Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.
Nine images appear on the time line for War between 1970 and 1991.
One covers the shooting of student protesters at Kent State; another focuses on ``Apocalypse Now,'' the ultimate anti-war film.
There are five separate images of the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war.
It shows a wall of death at the University of Rochester, representing the thousands of Iraqis who were killed in the conflict.
There is no mention of how the war began or who bears responsibility for the carnage.
Given the extraordinary scope and beauty of this project, however, these are minor quibbles.
Eyes of the Nation is not meant to be a textbook.
It is a compendium of sights and sounds, celebration and protest, pop culture and seminal ideas, reminding us of the richness and diversity of American life.
On that level, it is a stunning success.
The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation.
