As an idea goes, this one was small caliber, just one of many administrative details that Congress had before it in the spring of 1800 as it prepared to move to a new capital city.
The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided for a decade, there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.
That the library would grow into a pre-eminent world institution was beyond imagination.
On April 24, 1800, President John Adams approved an appropriation of $5,000 to purchase ''such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress.''
Books, mostly on history, economics and law, were ordered from London.
They arrived in 1801 and were shelved in the new U.S. Capitol.
The collection consisted of just 740 volumes and three maps.
Next Monday, millions of books and much history later, the Library of Congress celebrates its 200th anniversary as an institution that grew, in the words of one of its biographers, into ''a symbol of American democracy and faith in the power of learning.''
The celebration includes a major exhibition, ''Thomas Jefferson,'' featuring the first-ever reassembly of Jefferson's 1815 library in one place, arranged by the system he devised.
When it still amounted to little more than a few books on a few shelves the library had the good fortune to capture the interest of the one American with perhaps more interest in books than any other.
As president in 1802, Jefferson approved the first law setting out the role and functions of the new library.
While the law gave Congress the authority to set the library's budget, it awarded the appointment of the Librarian of Congress to the president.
That gave the new institution a government-wide reach.
In August 1814, an invading British army intervened.
It seized Washington and burned the White House and the Capitol.
The Library of Congress, which by then had about 3,000 volumes, was destroyed.
With one act, Jefferson became the founder of the Library of Congress as it now exists.
By then retired to his home at Monticello, Jefferson offered Congress the opportunity to buy his private library which then totaled nearly 6,500 volumes.
The purchase was approved.
The price was almost $24,000.
Jefferson called it the ''choicest collection of books in the U.S.'' He voiced hope it would have a permanent influence ''on the literature of our country.''
Acquiring Jefferson's books was a step in that direction.
It offered the Library of Congress the chance of establishing a comprehensive, universal collection.
When delivered in a caravan of horse-pulled wagons, Jefferson's library expanded the breadth of the collection dramatically.
It added books on architecture, the arts, science, literature and geography.
''He believed that the American legislature needed ideas and information on all subjects and in many languages in order to govern a democracy,'' writes library historian John Y. Cole in ''Jefferson's Legacy, A Brief History of the Library of Congress.''
Anticipating the argument that his collection might be too comprehensive, Jefferson argued that there was ''no subject to which a member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.''
Commenting editorially on July 15, 1815, ''The National Intelligencer,'' Washington's first newspaper, said: ''In all civilized nations of Europe there are national libraries ...
In a country of such general intelligence as this, the congressional or national Library of the United States become the great repository of the literature of the world.''
At Monticello, his hilltop home in Virginia, Jefferson quickly began to restock his own empty shelves, telling John Adams that now he was retired from public life he was reading more for amusement and pleasure than for practical use.
By the time he died in 1826, he had more than 1,000 volumes.
The institution he rescued also never stopped collecting.
''Jefferson gave us the rationale for today's library,'' says Cole who is also director of the Library's Center for the Book.
''Today the library is a world library,'' he said.
''We serve the world and we collect the world.''
