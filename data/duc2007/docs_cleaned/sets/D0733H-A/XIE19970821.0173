Susan Meinheit, librarian at the U.S. Library of Congress, noted today that the facility houses a collection of some 7,700 precious Tibetan books, most of which were brought to the country by western diplomats and explorers.
"The collection includes more than 300 rare volumes and original copies," according to Meinheit, who presented a detailed paper and report to the library's Tibetan collection to the 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies which opened yesterday in Beijing.
She said: "the library also has more than 300 xylographic and hand-written manuscripts."
She noted that William Rockwill, U.S. envoy to China in 1905, presented the library with 65 volumes of original Tibetan books, including a rare edition of "Changtiao Shu" (plate book) wrapped in yellow silk.
"Changtiao Shu", a unique type of Tibetan book wrapped in fine silk, consists of unbound xylographic pages in wooden covers.
Laufer sold to the library the Chien-lung Palace Edition of the Mahayana Sutra which was printed in rare red ink.
Scholars with the Beijing Library note that a large number of ancient Tibetan books can be found in numerous foreign countries and regions.
For example, a unique volume of the ancient Tibetan Medical Dictionary, the oldest and most detailed publication of its kind, is housed in London's Museum of Great Britain.
Chinese scholars must visit the museum to read, microfilm or copy the original.
The Beijing Library, China's largest library, currently houses a collection of 3,500 volumes of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, and 1,500 Tibetan studies books published since 1949.
