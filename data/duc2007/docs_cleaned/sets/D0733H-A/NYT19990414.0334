Jerry Jones, the flamboyant Dallas Cowboys owner best known in the rough and tumble worlds of sports and business, made a foray into the intellectual world on Wednesday with a $1 million gift to honor Thomas Jefferson.
Jones and his wife, Gene, gave the money to the Library of Congress to replace volumes in the third president's personal library that were destroyed in a fire in the Capitol in 1851.
``It's great to be on the team in this way,'' Jones said, speaking at a news conference in the ornate office of James Billington, librarian of Congress.
Pointing to a display of some of Jefferson's original books, Jones called them ``treasures of our past'' and said he wanted students learning about Jefferson ``to feel the roar of the crowd, so to speak.''
Also evoking sports imagery, Billington said: ``The generosity of this gift is, in itself, remarkable.
But in the heart of Washington Redskins territory, it is particularly appreciated.''
Jones kicked off the library's plan to celebrate its 200th anniversary next year by giving Billington a duplicate of a grammar book purchased by Jefferson in 1785.
The book, published in 1765 with the title ``Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Universal Grammar,'' was written by James Harris, an English scholar.
The Library of Congress plans to use the gift from Jones to recreate Jefferson's original collection of 6,400 books by replacing 987 destroyed or missing volumes with rare duplicates from other libraries, private collections or antiquarian booksellers.
Asked to compare himself with Jefferson, the Cowboys' owner at first demurred, saying that the author of the Declaration of Independence ``is an example to us all.''
Then he added: ``I'd like to think he was a sportsman.''
As if on cue, the library's expert on Jefferson, curator Gerard Gawalt, stepped forward to speak about Jefferson's love of horse racing and hunting.
``The fit between Mr. Jones and Mr. Jefferson is a lot closer than one would think at first glance,'' Gawalt said.
``I'll take that,'' Jones said.
Jefferson had a direct connection to the Library of Congress.
His books were purchased by Congress to be the core of the library after British invaders burned the Capitol in 1814 during the War of 1812, which ended with a peace treaty signed Dec. 24, 1814, in Ghent, Belgium.
The Library of Congress was first housed in the Capitol; it is now directly across the street from the Capitol.
The second fire, in 1851, started in a faulty chimney flue in the Capitol and destroyed two-thirds of the collection.
Jefferson's catalogue survived the flames, enabling curators to rebuild the collection.
Billington described it Wednesday as a ``universal collection'' that reflected the diverse interests ``of this universal man.''
Among the items that the Library of Congress' experts will be seeking are a pamphlet on pomegranates and a book on pasta machines.
The Library of Congress has a collection of more than 115 million items, including the diaries of aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright, the music of George and Ira Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein.
It is now digitizing many of its collections to make them accessible on the Internet.
