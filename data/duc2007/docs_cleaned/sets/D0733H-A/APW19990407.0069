million public-private project to preserve hundreds of movies, such as Paul Robeson's ``The Emperor Jones'' and Frank Capra's World War II series ``Why We Fight,'' is being organized by a federally authorized foundation.
Officials on Tuesday announced the millennium program, called Treasures of American Film Archives.
The coordinators are the National Film Preservation Foundation, set up by Congress, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
The Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia is making a $200,000 contribution on the heels of a $500,000 NEA grant in February.
The American Film Institute and other industry groups have also contributed.
Altogether, 17 separate archives will take part, including five federal agencies.
Hundreds of movies, some only a few minutes long, will be copied onto modern film stocks.
Workers will preserve a master copy, from which viewing copies will be made.
The Library of Congress will work on ``The Emperor Jones'' and a collection from the laboratories of inventor Thomas A. Edison.
It will also preserve footage taken in the field by anthropologist Margaret Mead, author of the landmark ``Coming of Age in Samoa.''
Movies made before the 1950s were on highly flammable nitrate film, library officials say.
Since then, newer and safer film stock has been used.
The National Archives will do the seven-film Capra series, commissioned by the War Department to overcome the isolationist feeling strong in the United States before World War II.
Duke Ellington's baritone saxophonist for 35 years, Harry Carney, took pictures of the orchestra between 1938 and 1941.
The National Museum of American History will be in charge of those, and of shorts on communications technology that Western Union started more than 70 years ago.
