Betty Fussell, a food writer best known for a book on the history of corn, says she often buys books rather than trying to use those in the New York Public Library.
``Everything is inaccessible,'' she said.
Everything, to her and other food researchers, means the books kept in the library's annex at 521 W. 43rd St., off 10th Avenue.
The annex was closed to the public in the spring of 1994.
The library decided that it was more efficient for the public to use annex materials at the main building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, where security is better.
Since then, researchers have had to request volumes at the main library and then wait days for them to be delivered.
Some researchers warn that an irreplaceable trove of culinary knowledge is in disarray, as books are no longer delivered between floors but across town.
Andrew Smith, who has written a history of ketchup and is awaiting publication of ``Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn'' by the University of South Carolina Press, said he flies to Washington to use the Library of Congress in preference to trying to get the research materials he needs from the New York library's collection.
``It can take three days to get a book from the annex if you're lucky,'' he said.
``Half the time, the books are missing or misplaced, and the condition they're in is often a disaster.''
Protests over the inaccessibility and condition of the books have spurred the library, which acknowleges the problems, to make changes.
With some 100,000 food-related books, 20,000 of them cookbooks, the library boasts the second-largest culinary collection in the country after the Library of Congress.
Although some of the older books are in the rare book room at the main library, most are stored in the annex.
``Food history is becoming more serious.
Many scholars are doing dissertations that are food related.
From where I sit it's a great collection, so why not take care of it?''
In April, Alexandra Leaf, the president of the Culinary Historians of New York, wrote to the organization's 255 members warning that ``a large number of books in the New York Public Library's culinary collection have badly deteriorated: bindings are worn, pages are crumbling or missing, and covers are chipped and cracked.''
Andrew Coe, the chairman of the group's cookbook committee, followed up with a letter to Dr. Paul LeClerc, the library's president, stressing the importance of the collection and suggesting remedies.
Jean Bowen, the library's director of humanities, then informed Coe that the collection would be cleaned and put in protective boxes, and transferred to a storage center with zones of temperature and humidity controls.
The center, which the library is building in Princeton, N.J., is expected to be completed in about two years.
Once the books are transferred there, they will be delivered on request to Manhattan the next day.
Though Coe wrote in his letter that he was alarmed by ``the specter of fragile materials being shipped back and forth on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' he offered his group's help, including fund-raising, to preserve the culinary collection.
Some books, he said, might not survive until the new center is finished.
As examples, he cited a copy of ``Le Maitre d'Hotel Francais,'' a cookbook written in 1822 by Antoine Careme, some of whose foldout illustrations are tattered or missing altogether.
He also mentioned that one volume had been lost from Careme's five-volume ``L'Art de la Cuisine Francais au 19th Siecle,'' published 145 years ago, and other volumes have pages torn or missing.
On June 3 representatives of the library agreed to begin moving 17th- and 18th-century cookery volumes from the annex to the rare book room, where they will be more accessible.
``Mr. Coe gave us a very helpful list of rare books that are in the general collection,'' Ms. Bowen said.
The transfer, which will begin with ``Le Nouveau et Parfaict Cuisinier'' (1668) by Pierre de Lune, is expected to take about a year.
The rest of the books will eventually be sent to Princeton.
The library has also agreed to allow scholars wishing to consult works catalogued as ``V'' class, which accounts for most of the culinary collections, to do so soon in the rare book room.
As for the group's offer to raise money to try to save the collection, Coe said that the library's directors did not encourage special provisions for the culinary books.
But, he said, the library's development office is exploring ways to allow the group to raise $100,000 for a curator to repair and restore materials.
Ms. Bowen, the library's humanities director, said, ``If there are people using our collections, and they have special concerns, I'm willing to listen.''
