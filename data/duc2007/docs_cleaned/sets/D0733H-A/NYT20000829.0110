The first was Ben Jonson.
Other notable poet laureates have been John Dryden, William Wordsworth, and Alfred Tennyson.
The current British laureate is Andrew Motion.
Like his predecessors, he is paid about $300 a year and a cask of white wine.
The US poet laureateship began in 1937 as the position of consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress.
In 1986, Senator Spark Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, added the title ``poet laureate.''
``My initial reaction when Congress passed the law,'' said Stanley Kunitz, who is laureate-designate and was poetry consultant from 1974 to 1976, ``was that no one can be poet laureate.
We are such a diversified culture that to assume one is actually the poet laureate of the American people is vainglorious.''
He added with a laugh, ``But one does the best one can.''
The job pays $35,000.
Duties are few: Give a reading at the start of the laureate's tenure, deliver an essay at the end, and help organize the library's literary programs.
The three most recent laureates, Rita Dove, Robert Hass, and Robert Pinsky, have redefined the post from one that was almost entirely honorary ``Life will go on exactly as before,'' said Robert Penn Warren upon being named first laureate to one that has become almost evangelical.
Pinsky has kept up a particularly energetic travel and speaking schedule, which has led some to question whether a nonagenarian like Kunitz is up to the job.
``It was a remarkable performance, and nobody will ever duplicate it,'' Kunitz said.
``Naturally, I don't intend to be how shall I phrase it?
