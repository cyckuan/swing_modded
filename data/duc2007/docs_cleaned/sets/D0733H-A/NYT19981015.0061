By MARGARET TALBOT FROM: The New York Times Magazine In October the Library of Congress opens the doors of its Thomas Jefferson Building for the largest exhibit ever assembled on the life and work of Sigmund Freud.
If the Library's estimates are correct, by the time the show closes on Jan. 16, more than a quarter million people will have inspected Freud's handwritten case notes on immortal patients such as the Rat Man, the famous letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess in which Freud renounces the so-called seduction theory and dozens of other manuscripts and first editions from the library's vast collection of Freudiana.
Visitors will see the actual chair Dr. Freud used in his examining room, the actual kilim rug that draped the iconic couch, his actual spectacles and a phalanx of the antiquities Freud collected and arrayed with fetishistic precision on his desk.
What makes this exhibit remarkable, however, is not so much the objects in it as the fact that it is happening at all.
In the jagged cardiogram that is the history of Freud's reputation, 1998 is not, after all, a peak.
Managed care has been notoriously inhospitable to long-term psychotherapy and notoriously hospitable to the quicker, cheaper fixes of behavior mod and Prozac.
The steady drip-drip of Freud criticism over the past decade attacks on his personal character, his originality, his therapeutic models and his scientific status has corroded the cultural prestige psychoanalysis once enjoyed among American intellectuals.
Moreover, the Freud show could just as easily have been doomed by the increasingly contentious politics of museum curatorship as by the anti-Freudian zeitgeist and for a time it looked as if it would be.
Museums especially history museums are now subject, in unprecedented degree, to the scrutiny and pressure tactics of interest groups, many of which insist on being heard at the earliest planning stages of a show and, more and more successfully, on getting their point of view incorporated into exhibits.
Witness the fate of the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space museum, drastically altered after veterans complained that it portrayed the Japanese as victims and failed to credit the bombing of Hiroshima with ending the war.
Or the exhibit of 19th- and 20th-century photographs called ``Back of the Big House: The Cultural Landscape of the Plantation,'' scheduled by the Library of Congress to open two years ago but canceled entirely after a group of African-American library staff members complained that the images it contained of slaves and slave quarters were offensive.
Or the recent Smithsonian exhibit on the history of sweatshops, which drew indignant protests from clothing industry lobbyists.
They didn't like the fact that the mock-up of a sweatshop featured in the show happened to be one that made not cigars or trinkets but apparel.
The dust-up over ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' came just after the Enola Gay and ``Big House'' protests, and seemed to presage a similar end.
In the summer of 1995, about a year after the library appointed a guest curator and scheduled the exhibit, an independent researcher and irrepressible Freud skeptic named Peter Swales rallied about 50 other scholars, most of whom had published work critical of Freud, to sign a petition.
The show's planning committee, the petitioners complained, was stacked with psychoanalytic apologists and its goal, as one of the signatories put it in an interview, was simply ``to polish up the tarnished image of a business'' psychoanalysis ``that's heading into Chapter 11.''
The petition said nothing about canceling or even postponing the exhibit.
But in December of that year, when the library suddenly announced that it was delaying the show indefinitely, the decision was widely perceived as a capitulation to the petitioners and to the threat of controversy.
The library's own explanation that it had run short of funds convinced virtually no one writing about the story at the time.
``Underlying the attempt to block the Freud exhibit was a particularly dangerous notion: that an institution owned by the government should avoid doing anything controversial,'' wrote the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis.
In the pages of The New Republic, the sociologist Todd Gitlin declared that, just as it had in the case of the ``Back of the Big House'' show, the library had ``chosen suppression over exhibition, silencing over debate.''
It now looks as if the library did delay the exhibit primarily for financial reasons it was $350,000 shy of the $900,000 budget projected for the exhibit, and this was not the first or last time that it had postponed shows for lack of funds.
Moreover, the Freud petitioners had not mobilized the support of members of Congress, as the Enola Gay protesters had, nor did their objections pivot on racial sensitivities, patriotism or the kind of populist, defense-of-decency politics that drove the disputes over art-museum shows such as the one devoted to Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs.
For these reasons, the library could afford not to yield to them.
Oddly enough, it was the assumption that it was caving in to pressure that allowed the library to raise the extra money it needed for the show.
Members of the American Psychoanalytic Association organized a letter-writing campaign.
Subsequently, the Discovery Channel made a gift of $125,000 and the Jewish Museum in New York signed on as a new venue to which the exhibit would travel.
And yet it will be difficult for anyone who sees ``Freud'' and who remembers the squall over it to judge it without some of the criteria of the anti-Freudians in mind.
Welcome to the era of preemptive-strike criticism.
Three years ago, when library officials chose the Freud show's guest curator, they selected, rather cannily, a young cultural historian named Michael S. Roth.
Roth, who was then at the Claremont Graduate School and is now at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, was only 38 at the time.
And despite the fact that he had written a book called ``Psycho-Analysis as History: Negation and Freedom in Freud,'' Freudian theory wasn't really his specialty or obsession he had published just as much about Hegel.
His intellectual preoccupation is with memory (``how people make sense of the past and what happens when they can't or won't,'' as he puts it), which might be thought of as a Freudian theme, but which clearly isn't exclusively one.
For a time it seemed that even the petitioners were willing to see Roth as a well-meaning sort, at worst a dupe of the older and more orthodox members of the show's planning committee the historian Peter Gay and the analyst Harold Blum, for instance.
``It seems so odd to talk of a significant cultural figure in terms of he's great or he's bad,'' Roth told me in an interview one rainy evening this past summer.
``Historians don't talk that way.
It's almost hubris to talk that way.''
Yet in the saga of this exhibit, there was Roth, with his wry, agnostic, historian's turn of mind, called upon to negotiate with Freud critics for whom there was really only one salient question: Was Freud right?
``And then this petition came up and the postponing of the show and all the press coverage of it, and suddenly friends were calling me from France saying, 'My God, Michael, we hear you're being burned in effigy over there.'''
The Library of Congress owns the pre-eminent Freud collection in the world, but much of the material in it had arrived with restrictions imposed by the organization that had assembled it, the Sigmund Freud Archives.
In recent years, however, the library had engineered a compromise with the archives' director, Blum, to make some sealed papers available if the names of patients were blacked out by reviewers chosen by the archives.
In the year 2000, almost all of the previously restricted material was at last due to be opened anyway.
The exhibit, then, was to be for the collection a sort of early and symbolic ``coming-out party,'' as the Librarian of Congress, James Billington, took to calling it.
Then Swales entered the picture.
Among the loose assembly of Freud skeptics, Swales is the anti-Freudians' anti-Freudian.
This is not only because of his research over the last 25 years, revealing the true identities of several early patients of Freud's who had been known only by their pseudonyms, but because of his appetite for provocation.
Swales is 50 now but still something of an enfant terrible.
He grew up in rural Wales, ran away from high school and home at 17 and spent much of his early career toiling in the British pop industry, mainly as a personal assistant to the Rolling Stones.
Freud studies was something Swales fell into in the early '70s, while working in New York with Stonehill Publishing, which brought out the first thorough study of Freud's early infatuation with cocaine.
In the summer of 1995, when Swales began circulating a letter of protest about the library's Freud exhibition, it didn't take him long to collect nearly 50 names.
Some of them were obvious choices for example, Frederick Crews, the literary critic turned Freud-loathing polemicist who holds Freud responsible for everything from ``egocentric and prurient encouragement to look for low motives in everyone'' to the excesses of the recovered-memory movement.
Gloria Steinem, a Freud disser from way back, added a glint of celebrity to the campaign.
And some of the signatories were rather surprising the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, for one, who had never made common cause with the anti-Freudians.
(Sacks later distanced himself from the affair, telling Psychiatric News that ``No one who knows me could imagine me as an anti-Freudian.'')
Apart from its rather mild language, the letter made one odd request namely, that a man named Henry Cohen, an attorney at the Congressional Research Service who was friendly with some of the petitioners, sit in on committee meetings ``to keep all of us apprised of the deliberations and developments.''
Roth would not have it: ``I remember being really disturbed by the idea that we would have this guy who was not a Freud scholar and who happened to be a lawyer monitoring us,'' he says.
Nonetheless, in the fall of 1995, Roth made a number of overtures to the petitioners.
He felt they deserved a serious response and he clearly hated the idea of being construed as a propagandist.
In October, he sent the petitioners each a ``Dear Scholar'' letter in which he said that they had ``alerted me to the dangers that the exhibit might unwittingly contain a partisan defense of Freud, or that we might not have paid sufficient attention to the recent historical and philosophical critiques of psychoanalysis.''
That fall (and indeed over the next two years), Roth grappled with the question of how an exhibit whose fundamental purpose was to showcase manuscripts in Freud's own hand and to explicate for the widest possible audience the ideas they contained could, at the same time, do justice to the contemporary critique of Freud.
``Some people wanted an exhibit that said that Freud was wrong, that he was a bad person, that, as one critic put it, we should have the moral courage to condemn him,'' Roth says.
``Well, that's just not what this particular show is about.''
It turns out that in the end, some of the critics are represented in a series of quotes that wrap around the display panels and amplify or refute the arguments of the manuscripts below.
They are a little too sound-bite-y, though, to convey much sense of their authors' objections.
And they are surrounded by quotes from earlier critics Wittgenstein, Nabokov, Germaine Greer which tend to make the contemporaries seem like merely the latest and tinniest voices in a long and clamorous parade of Freud detractors.
Freud has always generated resentment, this cacophony of commentary seems to say, and yet, look: He's still with us.
For a while, Roth wanted to end the show with a section called ``Contested Legacies,'' which would have highlighted the continuing debate over Freudian theory.
He liked the idea of introducing this section with ``two very simple, direct questions about psychoanalysis: Is it true?
But the other advisers worried that they were in danger of accentuating the conflict over Freud at the expense of what they saw as their first duty: setting out his ideas.
Besides, they concluded, the average museumgoer might well be alienated by an exhibit that seemed preoccupied with what was essentially a debate among scholars.
Now what viewers will see near the end of the exhibit, bracketed by photos of Nazi book-burnings and of Freud's four sisters who perished in concentration camps, are the manuscripts of ``A Word about Anti-Semitism,'' ``Why War?''
It is curious that the Freud show protests and all the new museum protests seem to share the notion, or fear, that every museumgoer will interpret an exhibit in exactly the same way and indeed, exactly as its planners intended.
``The premise behind all these protests,'' says Steven Conn, a museum historian at Ohio State University, ``is that all museum exhibits come heavily laden with political and interpretive baggage and there is only one way to read them.
The audience is essentially a passive receptacle.''
But why should that be so?
``No one thinks of texts that way anymore,'' as Conn points out.
``No one would argue that there is only one way to read 'Hamlet.'''
On the one hand, the interest groups that protest museum shows take a skeptical, post-modern view of exhibits.
They maintain that neutrality and objectivity are flimsy veils for the inescapably ideological agendas of curators.
And on the other hand, they take a rather old-fashioned, not to say condescending, view of the audience for those exhibits: They will think what they are being told what to think.
The question is: Why should the rest of us accept that premise?
