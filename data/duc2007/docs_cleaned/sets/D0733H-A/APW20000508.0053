Legendary entertainer Bob Hope is in Washington to attend the opening of the permanent Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment in the Library of Congress.
''He's anxious to be here,'' Hope publicist Ward Grant said today.
''We're anxious to get him here and get some photographs at the exhibit.''
Hope and wife, Delores, arrived Saturday, Grant said.
Hope is scheduled to attend a private reception Tuesday evening at the library.
Hope's son Anthony, daughter Linda, and singer Connie Stevens spoke at a press preview of the exhibit today.
''I'm looking forward to going through this collection myself and reliving and resharing those times and I hope the public feels the same way,'' Anthony Hope said.
Added Stevens, ''He taught me more than anything to make the stage my home and the audience my family.''
The exhibit includes 88,000 pages of jokes given to the library by Hope as well as countless other letters, photos, videos and other momentos.
''His career pretty much parallels the history of American entertainment.
He excelled in all the mediums,'' said Library of Congress spokesman Craig D'Ooge.
''It's both a history of Bob Hope and a history of American entertainment.''
The Hope family has donated $3.5 million for the upkeep of the items.
Hope turns 97 on May 29.
