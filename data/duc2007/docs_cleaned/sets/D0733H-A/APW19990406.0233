The nation's ninth poet laureate is getting a third, unprecedented year on the job.
Robert Pinsky, who teaches creative writing at Boston University, doesn't have the official wine allowance that Britain's poet laureate has been entitled to ever since Shakespeare's drinking friend, Ben Jonson, took the job in 1616.
``I've heard that they're going to abolish all that medieval nonsense, give him a one-year term like we have and put him on a salary,'' Pinsky said Monday about the British poet laureate, who serves for life.
Ted Hughes, Britain's last poet laureate, died last year.
Pinsky, 58, is the ninth American laureate since Congress created the title in 1985.
He was reappointed to a third year Monday by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington.
He will preside Wednesday at two readings at the library, one for youngsters of school age and one for prominent Washingtonians.
``We're hoping to have Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's representative in Congress and William S. Cohen, the defense secretary, to read their favorites,'' Pinsky said.
Cohen is a novelist, but Pinsky said he didn't know if the defense secretary had written any poetry.
Pinsky has been pushing a project in which President Clinton, other prominent people and ordinary Americans are asked to read their favorite poems aloud.
About 1,000 audio and 200 video recordings will be made.
They will be deposited in the Library of Congress as a record of how Americans felt about poetry at the turn of the millennium.
Next April, Pinsky will take a major part in a conference on ``Poetry and the American People,'' celebrating the library's 200th anniversary.
Pinsky gets an assistant, an office at the library and $35,000 a year.
His allowance comes from privately collected money, as does $20,000 each for three special consultants he will have for the first time this year.
The consultants will be Rita Dove, a former poet laureate, and Louise Gluck and W.S.
Merwin, both also well-known as poets.
