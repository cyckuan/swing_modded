Growing congressional concern about copyright control over the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s private papers is hampering negotiations to buy the collection from the slain civil rights leader's family.
House Republicans and Democrats say that if federal funds are used to purchase the papers for $20 million, then the Library of Congress should own the copyright of the collection.
The King family has expressed an interest in retaining at least partial copyright control, which would result in lucrative royalty fees if the papers are used in a commercial fashion.
Under such an agreement, if the collection of 80,000 documents is used to create an educational computer program or to write a book, royalties for the use of the King papers would go to the King family.
The King family would not comment directly about negotiations over the copyright.
Robert Vickers, a family spokesman, said a statement by Dexter Scott King, the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s son, on Oct. 27 still stands.
King said then that by accepting a payment that is far below the $30 million appraised value of the papers, the family was ``meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr. King while making a substantial gift to the nation.''
Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress, said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances.
``The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain rights when we obtain a collection, but we have allowed reasonable restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past,'' Brett said.
Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control on literary works of noted authors and historical figures.
But the purchase of the King papers is different, lawmakers say, because the collection would be purchased, not donated.
``If we are going to purchase or acquire the papers, we ought to have full control over the papers,'' said Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Library of Congress.
Behind the scenes, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) are working to bring legislation to the floor authorizing the Library of Congress to purchase or acquire the papers through private donations.
The Senate passed such a measure, but the authorization is stalled in the House over the copyright issue and over a sense among members that the papers should be donated.
Members of the civil rights movement agree.
``The man who stood for the spiritual values of this country is being exploited.''
Jonas said he cannot think of any members of the civil rights movement who sold their papers to the Library of Congress or other institution.
But it is not just the commercialization of the King legacy that has prompted concern.
Historians are equally worried about the collection that will be left behind at the King Center in Atlanta.
Louise Cook, former director of the King Library's archives and museum in Atlanta, said the papers that Congress wants to buy include documents from King's involvement with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
But Cook said those papers were separated from another collection of SCLC papers donated to the King Center in 1977, because Coretta Scott King kept them at her house.
The two collections should be kept together for historical purposes, Cook said.
``Any scholar would consider them to be inseparable,'' Cook said.
``They are two separate collections, but had the documents held by Mrs. King been available at the time, they would have been considered as one.''
Both collections contain similar documents, including handwritten notes, drafts of speeches, reports and correspondence with major civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young.
Cook left the King Center in 1987 over a fundamental disagreement with the way the papers were being stored and concern over the King estate charging fees to use the papers.
``Because Dr. King was the founding president of SCLC, I don't know how to distinguish what was his and what was SCLC's.''
David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and King biographer, agrees with Cook's assessment.
``The most important question right now is what does this mean for the SCLC papers and the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) papers?''
Garrow said.
Brett, at the Library of Congress, said that the other papers had not been considered as part of the negotiations.
