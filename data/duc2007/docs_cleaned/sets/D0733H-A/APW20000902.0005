Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving the nation's heritage.
''Not too hot, not too cold; not too moist, not too dry,'' curator Harry Katz describes the conditions for assuring they don't deteriorate into paper mache or dust.
''It's the same problem as preserving the Gutenberg Bible or Ansel Adams photos, though the parameters are different, depending on the materials.''
But the new digital trading cards on three-inch CD-ROMs will require also preserving what will inevitably become antique computer technology to read them.
''One problem is the hardware,'' Katz said.
''Technology moves so fast that in a few years today's computers may be obsolete.
No use keeping the disks if they can't be read.
How much equipment do we have to preserve, too?''
As society becomes more digitalized, the library is increasingly looking at computer capacity as much as warehouse space in planning its future needs.
''How many gigabytes should you have?''
Katz asked.
Many archives now exist only on the Internet, and it's not just archives.
Their work is just images you can see on a monitor,'' Katz said.
By law, the Library of Congress gets two copies of books and other printed materials that are copyrighted.
It doesn't keep all of them because it doesn't have the warehouse space.
It now faces the same problem with cyberspace: which artists and which works to preserve.
''We have to identify the best people and the work we want to keep,'' Katz said.
''We've been bandying a lot of names around, but we don't have a list yet.''
Mark Roosa, chief of the library's conservation division, divides the problem into two areas: material that is ''born digital'' and information that is ''reborn digital.''
The ''born digital'' includes art, electronic books, scientific journals, music and multi-media presentations.
''For instance, some of the music never resides in any format unless the end user decides to do it,'' said Roosa.
''Reborn digital'' material is taken from crumbling paper documents, wax cylinders like those Thomas Edison used for the first recordings, early television programs recorded on two-inch videotapes that can only be read by a few remaining pieces of equipment.
''There were 80 or 90 different formats for videotapes,'' Roosa said, ''You can't get the manufacturers to go back to old technologies and make the spare parts.
We have to be sure when we get information in new forms that we can migrate it forward.''
The library has a lot of conservation problems.
Microfilm, a relatively low-tech device, has been preserving newspapers for decades.
Not satisfied with that, the library wanted to keep the actual pages of The New York Times special supplement of April 28, 1912, on the sinking of the Titanic.
The ZFB Co. in Leipzig, Germany, had an experimental paper-splitting process.
It smoothed each page, covered it gently with a transparent tissue attached by a gelatin adhesive and inserted a sheet of acid-free paper between them.
The acid in newsprint makes it crumble in a few decades.
Then the experts encapsulated each page in a polyester film.
