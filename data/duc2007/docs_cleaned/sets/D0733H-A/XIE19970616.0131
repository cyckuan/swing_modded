Libraries are still a more accurate source of information than the Internet, thus students should not confine their research only to the Net, according to a Bar-Ilan University researcher in Israel.
David Schwartz, a researcher of the university's school of business administration, compared materials on various subjects found in the world's three major libraries, the U.S. Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the British Royal Library, to Internet researches he carried out on the same topics.
In each case, Schwartz said, the representation of the topics on the Internet was inferior to that in the three libraries.
Many Internet sites are profit-oriented, so one can not always trust the information provided by vested interests, he added.
"The Internet has opened up a treasure of information for researchers and seekers of knowledge throughout the world, and it has become common practice to turn to the Internet as a convenient source of information," he said.
He questioned the effectiveness of Internet int is presenting knowledge.
It is a foregone conclusion that the Internet will become the infrastructure for a global digital library, he continued, "but this is still years away from happening."
