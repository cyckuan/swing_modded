including TV's Big Bird and Gen. Colin Powell -- were feted Monday as ''Living Legends'' as they helped celebrate the 200th birthday of the Library of Congress.
Historian Jaroslav Pelikan from Yale University was chosen to speak on behalf of the group.
They received medals, along with another 54 celebrities who were not present.
''My first thought,'' Pelikan told the group to explain why he was picked as spokesman, ''is that I seem to be the only one among those present whose last name puts him into the same class with Big Bird.''
Then, turning serious, he compared the library with the ancient one in Alexandria, Egypt, which had carved over its entrance the words ''Hospital of the Soul.''
Pelikan, a historian of religion, was introduced by Librarian James H. Billington as the author of 30 books and translator of the works of Martin Luther.
Former Boston Celtics basketball star Larry Bird, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 91-year-old practicing heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey and comedian Bob Hope also were honored.
He wore his regular eight-foot fuzzy yellow costume, adorned for the occasion with a red and blue striped necktie.
As the first speaker from the group on stage, he said he was glad to be in the District of Columbia.
''Gee, I've never been to a birthday party for a library before.''
Looking forward as well as back, the Library also opened a new Web site for children and a reconstruction of President Thomas Jefferson's own book collection.
Acquired after British forces burned the original library in 1814, Jefferson's 6,487 books became the core of what is now the world's biggest one.
At last count, the Library of Congress had 9,429,184 books and nearly 110 million other items, in 460 languages.
The Post Office marked the occasion by issuing a new 33-cent stamp which shows the bright inside of the dome over the library's main reading room.
The U.S. Mint issued the first commemorative coins of the century: a silver dollar that will sell for $28 to $32, and its first gold-and-platinum $10 piece that will cost $395 to $425, complete with a satin-lined presentation case.
