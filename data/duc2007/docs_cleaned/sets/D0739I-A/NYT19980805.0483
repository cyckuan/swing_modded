We call your attention to the spot feature described below, which will move tonight, about the crowd and scene at the Broadhurst theater.
On Thursday, we will move a feature on Seinfeld's new show and the hoopla surrounding it.
That article is planned as the cover story in the Times' `Weekend' section.
The articles can be used individually or could be saved for the weekend and used as a package.
For more information, please call our toll-free number, (888) 346-9867.
Jerry Seinfeld, who drew inspiration for his wildly popular show from the idiosyncrasies of New Yorkers, brings his act back to New York City, returning to his stand-up roots in a performance at the Broadhurst Theater.
The story will include details on how scalpers have been selling tickets for as much as $1,500, a scene from the show and his monologue.

(The story is scheduled to move by 9:45 p.m.
