Don't fret: An herbal medicine man is offering free Saint Johnswort to help addicts through the depression he expects to come with Seinfeld-less Thursday nights.
``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kits'' include a month's supply of Saint Johnswort and a list of 25 names that rhyme with female body parts.
The kits have been created as ``a contribution to the improvement of society as a whole,'' says Ken Hakuta, creator and CEO of AllHerb.com.
Fans of ``the show about nothing'' can feel as good as they did when Seinfeld was on the air, and it's all free, Hakuta says.
His new Web site, AllHerb.com, is being launched to offer consumers a comprehensive herbal education, he says.
Industry experts will offer health tips, news and feature articles, as well as a mail-order supply of many herbal products.
``This is a fun way to show the application of natural herbal supplements,'' Hakuta says of the Seinfeld kits.
``What we are demonstrating here is that natural products can have very positive influence on our moods and our health.
Herbs help us feel good.''
Viewers can leave an e-mail message saying absolutely nothing on AllHerb.com's Seinfeld message board; they can also send absolutely nothing (except a clear return address) via regular mail to ``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kit,'' Jericho Communications, 304 Hudson St., Suite 700, New York, NY 10013.
Delivery will take a couple of weeks, a company spokeswoman says.
The kit, when taken in combination with any of the non-Seinfeld situation comedies in the new fall lineup, is intended to induce about the same level of enjoyment and happiness that we all received from Jerry and friends for the past decade, according to the company.
Warning: The kit should not be taken with an empty remote control ... or without the consent of your doctor.
