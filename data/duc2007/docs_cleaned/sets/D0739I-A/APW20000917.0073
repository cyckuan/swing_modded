Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there was life after Kramer.
Acting life, at least.
''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former ''Seinfeld'' star said.
''There wasn't anything that was really exciting me.
So I thought I was going to retire.''
After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about nothing,'' Richards took it easy.
He traveled, restored his home, read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David Copperfield.''
But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.
