(Includes a color slide of Jason Alexander in a scene from ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'')
By SHEP MORGAN (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)
``When I was a kid, my favorite cartoon was `Magilla Gorilla.'
Nonetheless, the actor who got famous playing a hapless schlep on ``Seinfeld'' (1990-1998) is about to hit movie screens as Boris Badenov, half of the inept team of Boris and Natasha in ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' opening nationwide on June 30.
``They did shave off half my eyebrows, though, and I want everyone to know I was wearing a fat suit I did not gain weight for this film.''
Based on Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon characters, ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' mixes animation and live action in a tale that pits the flying squirrel and moose against Boris, Natasha (Rene Russo) and their boss, the evil Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro).
It's De Niro's goofiest role by a long shot, but Alexander nonetheless admits that he was intimidated at the thought of working with the legendary actor.
``Actually, De Niro was very nice,'' he recalls, ``but a bit of an introvert.
Rene and I would be kidding around, and he'd just be kind of quiet.
You start thinking, `Is he preparing?
Is this part of his process?'
``And everybody was calling him `Mr. De Niro,''' Alexander adds.
Finally we had a scene where they had to move the mark where he was supposed to stand about two inches.
They were all going, `Mr. De Niro, we've moved your mark about two inches, will that be a problem, sir?'
Alexander laughs.
``Fortunately,'' he says, ``everybody, including Mr. De Niro, broke up, and that was sort of an icebreaker.''
No icebreaker was required with Russo, who Alexander says reminded him of his first days with ``Seinfeld'' co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
``Usually there's a learning curve when you work with somebody for the first time,'' he says.
``But with Julia, she came in the door and said, `Let's do it.'
It was the same with Rene when I met her, she said, `I think you're really funny, so show me how to be.'
``We had a lot of fun, which was fortunate, because we're sort of joined at the hip during the entire film.''
Alexander has 4- and 8-year-old sons, but he says they didn't influence his decision to accept ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.''
In fact, he doubts they'll even see it.
``My children are so unimpressed with me that it's pathetic,'' he says.
They never saw `Seinfeld,' and they won't even watch `The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' where I did the gargoyle voice.
His own childhood, spent in a middle-class New Jersey suburb, was no picnic, Alexander says.
``Then I discovered a pre-emptive strike getting kids to laugh with me instead of at me,'' he recalls.
``It seemed to work,'' Alexander says.
``Suddenly I wasn't getting picked on anymore.
But I was not the class clown, and I never thought of being an actor I was just trying to survive.''
By the time he was a teen-ager, however, he had begun singing and dancing lessons, which paid off when he headed for Broadway.
In 1989 he earned a Tony Award for his performance in ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
In fact, he says, if it weren't for Nathan Lane he might still be on Broadway, since Lane often snagged roles Alexander was after, and vice versa.
``I'd see him at an audition and say, `Maybe we should just flip a coin to decide which one of us should leave,''' the actor recalls.
``I'd be up to replace him and he'd be up to replace me.
The sad part is that Nathan and I never ended up doing anything together.''
As it turned out, true stardom awaited Alexander on television, in the form of the bumbling, self-obsessed George Costanza.
``I'm always kind of stunned by the love people have for George,'' he says, shrugging.
``I'd say, `You either need therapy or different friends that is not a compliment.'''
Alexander settles back reflectively.
``He reacted with anger and self-aggrandizement but, to his credit, he also was self-deprecating.
It's why people love Howard Stern he's vicious and inappropriate, but he skewers himself more mercilessly than anybody else.''
Alexander may be a star, but he's avoided most of the Hollywood lifestyle, and has been married to Daena Title for 18 years.
``It's dumb luck,'' Alexander says with a smile.
``But when you get toward middle age, you hit a bump.
Daena and I have had some problems, and a couple of years ago we went into therapy and worked on them.
``It's not easy,'' he concedes.
``It's not fun.
But if you have something valuable, you do it.
We came out at a better place than when we started our relationship.
I'm very lucky, because I'm married to an exceptional woman.''
Raising their children has been made much more complicated by Alexander's success on ``Seinfeld.''
``Fortunately and unfortunately, you can't escape the fact of celebrity,'' he says.
``There are perks and there are problems.
For instance, we want our kids to have a normal life but I can't take them to the supermarket, because I'll get too much attention.
So we have an assistant go to the market and, if they want to go, they go with the assistant.
That's not normal, so it's kind of a vicious cycle.''
``Seinfeld'' made its cast members rich, with Alexander, Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Michael Richards pocketing $600,000 per episode for the final season.
Alexander admits to mixed feelings about the whole thing.
``Am I worth almost a million dollars?''
``So I don't need a million dollars,'' Alexander concedes.
``But in the TV marketplace we were running circles around everybody else, so why not?
``But the world is bent on its ear in that respect nothing I do is worth what a schoolteacher does.''
