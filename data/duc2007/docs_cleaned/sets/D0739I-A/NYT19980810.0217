But not Jerry Seinfeld.
In the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely successful sitcom after nine years.
And Sunday night, live from New York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up material he has cultivated so far in his career.
While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes for the first time.
Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational gags split among at least three other jokers.
Sunday night, wearing a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house.
At one point, a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib ``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' he gestured at the rest of the audience ``see other people.''
Miraculously, he managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the strangeness of ordinary things.
Always obsessed with hygiene, he spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body odor.
``How long are these shifts?''
He thought out loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the cows tip them off when they're millking them.''
One surprise was the physicality of his performance.
It was Michael Richards as Kramer who provided most of the visual humor on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body and facial expressions to tell his stories.
He mimicked the way flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits.
He did an impression of a wolf man shaving.
And in a riff about a forthcoming visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out of a driveway without looking.
On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even edgy.
In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight Show'' feel to it.
There was no envelope pushing, no Robin Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his unusual sensibility.
But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out.
The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled film set in a graveyard.
As a group of very familiar faces of comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling, George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno, Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at least.
