His short tour of the Midwest is a dress rehearsal for a cable TV show he'll call ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,'' but a better title would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've Heard This One.''
Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on his old standup routine, preparing for a finale in his hometown, New York City, that will be aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9.
``After that,'' he has promised, ``I won't use that material ever again.''
Friday night, in the lovely and historic Orpheum Theater (downtown Omaha's version of the Midland Theatre), Seinfeld delivered a 75-minute medley of his greatest hits.
The theater, which seats about 2,800 people, was nearly full for the second of four shows at the Orpheum last weekend.
The Omaha World-Herald , however, reported Friday that the event's promoter, Contemporary Productions, had given away an average of 500 tickets per show, mostly to local media outlets.
The newspaper cited the $60.50 ticket price as the reason for slightly sluggish sales.
Despite the price, the familiar routines and a few rough spots (his transitions need sanding and polishing), most of the crowd reacted as if each joke had been baked fresh that day.
Maybe, like most ``Seinfeld'' fans, they're accustomed to laughing at reruns.
There were plenty of those: - On why men don't like to write checks: ``To men, a check is like a note from your mother.
On bathrooms in airplanes: ``There's a slot for used razor blades.
What I want to know is, who is shaving on the airplane?
And shaving so much that they're using up razor blades.
Is the Wolfman on the plane?''
On the rubber divider at the grocery checkout: ``We use the rubber divider because we don't want someone else's items fraternizing with our own.
The rubber divider is the universal signal for `Back off!'
On the high price of candy at movie theaters: ``That's why they put it in a jewelry case.
You feel like you're buying a diamond: `Excuse me, I'd like to see something in a Milk Dud.'
And then they bring you one Milk Dud on a black velvet pillow ...'' - On pain relievers: ``Everything is `extra-strength' now.
You can't even get `strength' anymore; `strength' is off the market.
But for some people, extra-strength isn't enough.
They need `maximum strength,' which is like telling the drug companies, `Figure out how much will kill me, pull back a little and give me that.'
On skydiving: ``What exactly is the helmet for?
Let me tell you, if you're skydiving and your parachute doesn't open, your helmet is wearing you for protection.''
On dating: ``A date is a job interview that lasts all night.
The only difference: There's no chance you'll end up naked at the end of a job interview.''
Toward the end of the evening, Seinfeld delivered some newer (or lesser-known) material and more evidence of his comic brilliance.
Like few other comedians (a younger George Carlin comes to mind), Seinfeld examines the enduring quirks and oddball habits that afflict so many of us in the Western world.
`Seinfeld' was more about everything about so many of our common behavioral tics than about nothing.
For example, as he talked about men and how ``in their own minds they live lives of super heroes,'' he sketched this observation: ``Most of you have seen this: a guy driving down the street with a mattress or box spring tied to the top of his car, and he's got his arm out the window and he's holding on to the mattress with one arm.
Here's what this guy is thinking: If a big gust of wind were to catch the mattress and lift it, breaking the rope, he'll be able to hold the mattress to the roof with one arm and prevent it from flying off the car.
`It's OK; I got it.'
For his encore, Seinfeld spent several minutes taking questions and a few gifts from his audience: ``Will you do movies?''
You watch a bad movie, it only costs you two hours.
You do a bad movie, it costs you two years.''
When a woman presented a bouquet of flowers to him, he said, ``Thank you very much.
But you know what most men think they get flowers from a woman?
`Oh, great.
Now I gotta take care of these.'
He ended the show by following his own advice (to his TV buddy George): Leave on a high note.
After someone from the back of the balcony bellowed, ``Hello, Jerry,'' Seinfeld let rip with a ``Hello, Newman'' that brought most of the house screaming to its feet.
