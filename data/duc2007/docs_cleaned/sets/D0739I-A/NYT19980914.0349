In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000 apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom, ``Ellen.''
Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run ``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's distributor, Columbia TriStar TV.
Variety estimates that all `Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
WATL's pact expires in March 2001.
There remains an 18-month period between that date and the start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.
``'Seinfeld' is one of the three shows in history 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Andy Griffith Show' are the others to sign off at No.
