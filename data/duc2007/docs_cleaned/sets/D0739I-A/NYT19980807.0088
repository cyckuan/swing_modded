Jerry, thanks for the laughs, the memories and all the goodbyes.
Now, go away.
Missing Jerry Seinfeld is hard, and not because ``Seinfeld'' has left the air after nine glorious seasons (well, seven glorious, one all right and one pretty average seasons).
It's difficult to have withdrawal when he is still around so much.
Jerry is becoming like your favorite uncle who came to visit for a week and has been living on the couch since last spring.
Look, it's Jerry on a commercial!
Wow, Jerry is on a magazine cover!
Jerry is guest-announcing a Mets game!
And, hey, Jerry is on world tour and giving tickets away!
Now he's returning to his roots: New York and stand-up comedy.
His 10-show run at Broadway's Broadhurst Theater mercifully titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' is highlighted by a live telecast airing Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO.
Reviews of his previous shows have been positive, even though Seinfeld is a decade removed from his stand-up career.
So touring in Australia and Europe and across the United States is what one would consider retirement?
``Stand-up for me is not like work,'' Seinfeld said this week at a New York City news conference.
``It is a very liberating type of performance.
Putting on a weekly TV show is very complicated.
``Stand-up was the best way for me to feel free and feel relaxed.
To be in front of the audience is the most fun I can have.''
When Seinfeld (who first appeared on HBO 17 years ago as part of a series of young comedians, and last was seen on there in 1987 in a stand-up show) says ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,'' he means it.
The material he will use observations of the arcane and sublime borne from his original stand-up act and perfected on his NBC show will be retired after the show.
Thank God.
In many ways, Jerry Seinfeld's last season on NBC was like the last season for Hall of Famer Willie Mays: both stayed around one year too long, and were shadows of their former selves.
Unlike Mays, Seinfeld can retool and recast himself.
After the Broadway show, Seinfeld will look to develop fresh material.
``Did you ever notice ...'' could be replaced by something else.
What, even he doesn't know.
``It will probably take eight months to a year, I would say, before I'm ready to do another concert ... depending how hard I work,'' he said.
It's strange: I liked ``Seinfeld'' when a lot of people weren't watching, and grew to detest it proportionally to its popularity.
The hype had a lot to do with it.
And while many considered the last episode (watched by more than 76 million on May 14) lame by ``Seinfeld'' standards, you had to respect him for avoiding the cliched hankies-and-hugs route.
``Criticism is always fair,'' he said.
``What people forget is, it's unimportant.''
Thanks.
And ouch.
After this concert series, Seinfeld plans to kick back, work on the new routine, maybe even go into the creative side of the advertising business.
He definitely has the schtick to sell.
What he won't be doing is doing movies or another series.
Jerry is nothing if not smart: He knows he could never be that lucky twice.
When asked who would replace him on the cultural radar screen, Seinfeld paused, then deadpanned.
``There will be no next Seinfeld.''
Yes, there was only one Jerry.
Now get out of here for a while so we can miss you.
