His show was about nothing.
His new house in the Hamptons is about $40 million.
Jerry Seinfeld agreed to pay that for a 12-acre East Hampton beach estate that once belonged to rock star Billy Joel.
As the masters of a new domain on exclusive Further Lane, Seinfeld and new wife Jessica Sklar will be with the beautiful people during the summer months.
Neighbors on Seinfeld's street include ''Saturday Night Live'' creator Lorne Michaels, designer Helmut Lang and writer James Brady, and that's just the tip of the Hamptons' social iceberg.
Steven Spielberg and ''60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt own homes on the island's East End, while frequent summer visitors include Sean ''Puffy'' Combs and Donald Trump.
When it comes to keeping up with the Joneses, Seinfeld is more than holding his own.
Billionaire Revlon boss Ronald Perelman's East Hampton estate is worth a mere $15 million.
Seinfeld and Sklar already share a home on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Details on how the purchase came about were limited.
Jerry was shopping for a Hamptons retreat, he was turned down a couple of times, and yada yada yada ... he bought a $40 million home.
Comedian Paul Reiser brought Seinfeld and Joel together.
Joel reportedly gave the Seinfelds a personal tour of the property, which the Piano Man purchased in the mid-1980s and redid in the style of a Mediterranean villa.
Joel's move is work-related.
He wants a home on Long Island's North Folk, closer to a recording studio where the Grammy winner is working on a classical music album.
Seinfeld, 45, is a native of the far-less-tony Long Island town of Massapequa.
He and his wife were married on Christmas Day 1999.
