judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his identity for the character of George Costanza.
State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael Costanza's suit was frivolous.
Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld.''
Costanza said the show portrayed him in a negative, humiliating light, and that ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David defamed him when he called Costanza a ``liar'' and ``flagrant opportunist'' trying to cash in.
Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed sanctions of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer, Jonathan Fisher.
