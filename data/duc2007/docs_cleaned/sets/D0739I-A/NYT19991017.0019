Imagine Seinfeld if it had been on HBO in stead of NBC and it starred co-creator Larry David instead of Jerry and it had only been as funny as it was the last couple of seasons.
That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.
The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness.
One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in a conference call.
``It was as insincere as you could get.
Insin cere hugging is al lowed.''
Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza, he is also a former stand-up comedian himself.
He hadn't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking about giv ing it another shot.
``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said.
``Like everything else, I was reluctant at first.
The more people I asked about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea.
However, he wasn't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
Then, I started to think I needed some other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage.
We couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had to come up with some stuff.''
``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well.)
Curb Your Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary totally unscripted about David's return to stand-up.
``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
``Certainly, the stand-up is real.
Most of it's embellished, but some of it's real.''
Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen.
``I'm not re ally stretching there.
That's pretty much who I am.''
That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series.
``Like some people are good enough to make the cut.''
Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap pearance, commenting on David.
So does Jerry himself, who relates that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the audience as ``you people.''
Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David.
``He just couldn't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people.''
David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship.''
``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent.
``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody's brilliant.
It's very extreme thinking.''
Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage.
Of course, David's life has changed as well.
Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man, in deed.
But that's the only change, he said.
``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my house now,'' he said.
``That's the difference.''
David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it so funny.
He famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
David naturally begs to differ.
``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like it?
It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish.''
Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale.
Then again, how could it not be?
