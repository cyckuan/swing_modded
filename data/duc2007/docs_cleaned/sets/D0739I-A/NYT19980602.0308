Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script, filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television.
But are sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth thousands of dollars?
As they say on television, stay tuned.
On June 18, little more than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page script with all the ``alrights.''
Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000.
But some television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood collectibles is blossoming.
``As you enter the new millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century.''
Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate, television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who wrote it).
On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the 23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that `Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television jargon as an original `table draft.'''
In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors ad-libbed.
Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes dropped before the episode was filmed.
Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10 billion market for collectibles.
Dealers say that prices for television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated 1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public awareness.
But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,'' becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go on the auction block.
Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996.
Again, value is tied to autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners'' script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music to `The White Album,''' he said.
Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This Is Your Life'' went for $1,150.
Once again, autographs were essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and his trainer.
Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles.
And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993.
The owner recently put it on the market for $5,000.
``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said.
``While we were working on it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone.'''
In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer Gene Roddenberry.
The 26-page typewritten document describes the spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars.''
Most of the characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
Not yet, he acknowledged.
But not to worry, either.
``They're going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said, ``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this time.
`Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with the scripts.''
