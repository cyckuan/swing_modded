Actor Michael Richards is reed thin.
Actor John Goodman is not.
But the two have something very much in common: Each has a new sitcom on the fall schedule, and neither had much to bring to show-and-tell at the TV critics' press tour in Pasadena.
After shooting pilot episodes, each has scrapped the first draft and gone back to the drawing board.
Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy.
Tim Meadows is leaving ``Saturday Night Live'' to join the cast.
William Devane is also on board.
Goodman, whose show for Fox remains untitled, will play William ``Butch'' Gamble Jr., a gay man who returns to his hometown in Ohio, where his adult son and ex-wife still live.
Aside from the son, to be played by Greg Pitts, the Goodman show is still casting about for the ex-wife, as well as for Butch's sister and her two children.
Though it's not unprecedented for a show to be pilotless in July, it's often not a good sign.
Fall-series production begins just about now, so a show that's still trying to decide what it wants to be has only a few weeks to set a course.
Fortunately, the fall season is late this year because of the summer Olympics, pushing the premiere of Richards' show into October at the earliest.
Goodman's will be even later Nov. 1 because of Fox's commitment to the World Series.
Richards, whose private persona is completely unlike the manic Kramer he played on ``Seinfeld,'' seemed almost apologetic when he asked critics to be patient.
``I'd like to say just stick with us.
We're working hard here, and I think you'll see something quite special this fall.''
Goodman, meanwhile, remains ever sarcastic, with nary a clue about what producers Bonnie and Terry Turner have in mind.
``I'm right now kind of a hired-gun guy,'' he said.
``I'm waiting to see how it shapes up before I start screwing up.''
As they say in TV, stay tuned.
Olympia, Wash., native Sonja Christopher, the first contestant to be voted off the island in ``Survivor,'' is a little dismayed by what she experienced in her short time on Pulau Tiga in the South China Sea and by what she has seen of the program on TV.
Christopher, who is 63, was referring to the three basic tenets of ``Survivor'': to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition.
Troubled by the creation of power alliances on the island and outright deception by at least two contestants when asked if such alliances exist, she looked at producer Mark Burnett and said: ``I hope the program doesn't teach the young people in America that the way to win is to be duplicitous and dishonest.
That's a concern of mine.''
