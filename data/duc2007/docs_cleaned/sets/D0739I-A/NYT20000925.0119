Is there life after ``Seinfeld''?
Some viewers, surveying the mostly feeble comedies that remain since Jerry and the gang left prime time in 1998, may have glumly concluded that no, there is not.
But is there life after ``Seinfeld'' for the show's cast?
Michael Richards is about to find out.
For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman the mailman.
Kramer became a cult figure on one of the most successful sitcoms of all time.
Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct. 24 on WHDH-TV (Ch.
He will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an American Inspector Clouseau.''
Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of being typecast.
He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention'' that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation.
``They didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept.
Now, are you going to have your hair up?
How are you going to come through the door?'
Not that Richards is entirely leaving ``Seinfeld'' or Seinfeld behind.
For one thing, the team that assembled his new show consists of three former ``Seinfeld'' writers, including Spike Feresten, author of the legendary ``Soup Nazi'' episode.
For another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on building a better sitcom.
``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,'' said Richards.
``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said, `Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off.''
Because Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the ``logistics'' of the former role.
The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to accept Richards in a non-Kramer role.
Co-creator Gregg Kavet touched on the conundrum the ``Michael Richards'' team faced.
``You're dealing with Kramer, probably one of the best-loved characters ever on television,'' said Kavet.
``And it's something where everyone is expecting to see that, but they're also reluctant to see the exact same thing again.
So what we've tried to do is basically figure out ways to exploit Michael's strengths, .
Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards.
The actor's speaking style is deliberate, even ponderous, a far cry from Kramer's extraterrestrial outbursts.
Richards referred to himself several times as an ``artist,'' and lapsed frequently into performers' jargon.
But his love of his craft, especially physical comedy, comes through when he discusses some of his comic heroes, the likes of Ernie Kovacs, Peter Sellers, Charles Chaplin, and Jacques Tati.
By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of the show.
The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the supporting cast around Richards.
``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.
He did emphasize, though, his hopes that the show will develop the kind of ensemble strength that became a hallmark of ``Seinfeld.''
Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.
But I feel that this is going to be an ensemble-driven show.''
Though Richards and Meadow are the professional comedians and Devane is known for a glowering intensity in film and TV dramas, it was Devane who showed a deadpan, even Seinfeldian, touch when he explained how he got his role.
``They were looking for an older guy, and I'm an older guy,'' he said dryly.
``So that all kind of worked out.''
