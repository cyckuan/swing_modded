Jerry Seinfeld is collecting new material Jack Kerouac-style by driving across the country?
Get out!
Seinfeld was en route from New York to Albuquerque, N.M., in a 1973 Volkswagen Beetle this week when he decided to pull into this country music town to see an old friend and collect on a gold mine of potential material.
On Tuesday, Seinfeld took in a show at the Bobby Vinton Theater.
Seinfeld and Vinton used to play in Las Vegas at the same time, said Chris Vinton, the pop singer's son.
Seinfeld ''said he was really excited about being in Branson and was somewhat overwhelmed by it and surprised by how sophisticated the facilities are,'' Chris Vinton said.
