Jerry Seinfeld has a new girlfriend, and Jerry Seinfeld's new girlfriend has an angry husband.
Seinfeld took up with 26-year-old Jessica Sklar soon after she married Broadway theater scion Eric Nederlander four months ago, the New York Post and the Daily News reported this week.
Nederlander, whose father owns six theaters and a piece of baseball's Yankees, is filing for divorce.
The Post said Seinfeld began seeing Sklar after she returned from her honeymoon in Italy last summer.
But friends of the couple said the marriage was doomed from the start and the breakup has nothing to do with Seinfeld.
Seinfeld's spokeswoman did not immediately return calls Tuesday.
The Post said he is mortified by the mess.
Dan Klores, a spokesman for Nederlander, said: ``The family is appalled by the behavior of Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld.''
Michael Flatley, who hung up his ``Lord of the Dance'' shoes last summer, agreed Tuesday to pay his former manager a ``substantial sum'' to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit.
The terms were not disclosed.
John Reid claimed he was summarily dismissed in a letter in 1997, seven months after the management contract was signed.
The contract was not due to expire until this month.
Reid, who sought dlrs 17 million, said Flatley fired him just as the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged.
``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind me,'' Reid said.
``It is a real shame that so much time and money and effort has been wasted in the process of getting to the point which we could have reached two years ago.''
Flatley said Reid was abusive and preoccupied with other clients.
George Martin's score for Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind '97'' the best-selling single of all time will be auctioned off for charity.
The arrangement, written in a hurry by the legendary Beatles producer last year for the tribute to Princess Diana, is expected to fetch about dlrs 100,000 when Sotheby's holds the sale in New York in December, the auction house said.
New York-Duesseldorf flight arrived Tuesday with one more passenger than had checked in: a 30-centimeter (12- inch) snake.
Still, the flight went on as scheduled.
Another passenger took control of the situation, wrapping the the creature in two plastic bags and setting it in a bathroom for the duration of the trip, Duesseldorf airport officials said.
Police were called to meet the plane to identify the snake, which turned out to be harmless and was turned over to a zoo.
It was unclear how the snake got on board the plane.
Katherine Bell, 34, said she was sleeping alongside her 6-year-old daughter Carla when she felt a pain in her leg at about 4 a.m. ``I thought it was my cat playing on my bed,'' said Bell, of Brisbane.
Bell staggered out of bed, flailing wildly to free herself from the snake.
Loosing herself from the two-meter (two-yard)-long reptile, she threw it to the floor before fleeing the room.
The snake escaped into nearby woodlands through a sliding door.
Ambulance officers took Bell to nearby Redland Bay Hospital for treatment to puncture wounds on her leg, knee and finger while police called in a snake handler, who found the reptile.
Carpet snakes are not poisonous, but can inflict a painful bite.
It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit.
``We changed the subject of the prayers from the plight of the Israeli people to our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of Rabbi David Batsri and one of four passengers aboard.
``My father ... called out the names of chapters in Psalms, chapters named after angels, and then he asked them to come and help,'' the younger Batsri said.
The pilot eventually brought the plane down safely in northern Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri said the passengers' deliverance was proof that a similar miracle could happen at the Wye, Maryland, talks.
