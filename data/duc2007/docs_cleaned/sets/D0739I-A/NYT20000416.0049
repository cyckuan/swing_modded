Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld.
Among the blue-chip brands they have peddled are ATT, American Express, Clairol, Tommy Hilfiger, Pepsi-Cola, Rold Gold and Visa.
But now, many of the actors who played supporting characters on ``Seinfeld'' are also turning up in campaigns for products ranging from automobiles and candy to soft drinks and prescription drugs.
The sidekicks taking center stage include Estelle Harris, who played George's mother; Wayne Knight, Newman; Phil Morris, Jackie Chiles; and Patrick Warburton, Puddy.
Such interest among marketers and agencies in characters with smaller roles is unusual after a show ends production.
Typically, ad work goes to the actors who were the better known stars of a series, even though it almost always costs more to hire them than their supporting cast.
Examples include Barbara Billingsley, June Cleaver on ``Leave It to Beaver''; Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, George and Louise Jefferson on ``The Jeffersons''; and Florence Henderson, Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch.''
But ``Seinfeld'' broke rules for the content of TV sitcoms; conventional wisdom held that viewers would not warm to characters who were whiny, New Yorkers or identifiably Jewish.
Now the show is breaking rules on the selling front.
```Seinfeld' was so long running,'' said Tom Lom, managing director at Saatchi Saatchi Health Care in New York, which is using Knight at his Newmanian worst to personify the flu bug in a campaign for the prescription drug Relenza sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
``And it's still on the air in reruns.''
``So people remember the characters from the prime-time run,'' he added, ``and still get exposed to the characters through the reruns.''
The first episode of ``Seinfeld'' appeared on NBC in May 1990 and the last episode appeared in May 1998.
The reruns, syndicated by the Columbia Tristar Television Distribution unit of Sony Pictures Entertainment, are shown on 224 stations.
``Even though the show is not on, the familiarity is there,'' said John Clarke, chief advertising officer at Dr Pepper/Seven Up in Plano, Tex., part of Cadbury Schweppes.
For the Diet Dr Pepper soft drink brand, Young Rubicam Advertising in New York created a commercial with a courtroom theme featuring Morris in his persona as the slick lawyer Chiles.
Morris also donned his Chiles regalia mustache, glasses, stylish suit for two humorous spots for the Odyssey minivan sold by the American Honda Motor Co. ``Plenty of people in the minivan category, young families, watched or are watching `Seinfeld,''' said Larry Postaer, executive vice president and creative services director at the Honda agency, Rubin Postaer Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
In creating the commercials, ``we thought it might be fun to bring on a celebrity lawyer as a surprise,'' Postaer said.
``But the real ones don't do that or shouldn't.''
``This gave us someone who is recognized,'' he added, ``and funny.''
Morris is not the only ``Seinfeld'' second banana doing double duty for advertisers.
Warburton has worked for the Cadillac division of General Motors and the MM's line of candy sold by a division of Mars Inc. ``I missed all the shows he was on, but when he played a cop in the Cadillac commercial I came into the office and asked my group: `That guy is great.
Who is he?'''
``Every so often, like in sports, a team gets assembled that has four or five Hall of Famers on it,'' Miesmer said.
``That show had so many actors who were so good.''
One benefit of using secondary characters was described by Patrick Sherwood, president of the Los Angeles and Troy, Mich., offices of the Cadillac agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton Bowles, part of the B Com3 Group.
``They're a little bit below the radar in a commercial context,'' he said, ``which was important for us because we wanted a different voice for the Cadillac brand.''
``Patrick Warburton was seen as engaging, entertaining and credible, not a shill,'' he added.
``Coming from an ensemble cast, he had an ability to react and a degree of spontaneity that was really refreshing.
He was so successful, he did several spots for us.''
Despite the appeal of the ``Seinfeld'' second-stringers, not all of them can expect to be on the first team for advertisers.
For instance, Clarke at Dr Pepper/Seven Up said he would not consider a commercial with Larry Thomas, who played the unwelcoming proprietor of a soup store.
``We try to encourage people to come in,'' Clarke said, laughing, ``not chase them out.''
